          "s": "<p>The Committee noted a resubmission from Roche for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a funding application for ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS was reviewed and recommended for decline by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2018</a>. The Committee noted that at the time, it was considered that despite the high unmet health need in people with PPMS, there were significant concerns with the application, including a lack of data to establish both the safety and efficacy in this currently untreated group, and PTAC considered that the pivotal study (ORATORIO \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Montalban et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376(3):209-20</a>) that was reviewed may have had a bias in the estimate of effectiveness. The Committee noted at the time that more studies were ongoing, and likely to be completed and published in the near future, which may address some of these concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in June 2018, advice was sought from the Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Advisory Committee (MSTAC), which recommended that ocrelizumab be funded with a medium priority for PPMS with active inflammatory disease. PTAC noted that MSTAC had in turn noted that the ORATORIO trial population composition was unusual, with 25% having MR gadolinium enhancing lesions; however, MSTAC had considered that the trial publication\u2019s statistical analysis was appropriate and that it supported treatment for PPMS, particularly in those with gadolinium enhancing lesions. The Committee noted that in November 2018, PTAC noted MSTAC\u2019s recommendation, but still considered that more robust evidence of improved health outcomes was needed to change PTAC\u2019s previous recommendation that the application be declined.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that ocrelizumab has been funded since December 2019 for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subject to Special Authority criteria, and that all applications are currently assessed by the MSTAC.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by dysregulation of the peripheral immune system and leading to demyelination of neurons and subsequent neurodegeneration. The Committee noted that the majority (85-90%) of MS patients are diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Some of these patients may later develop into secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The remaining 10-15% of patients with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. Some data suggests that 12% of the NZ MS population has PPMS. The Committee noted that diagnosis of PPMS is often retrospective, and that patients often present with significant disability. The Committee noted that rates for PPMS are similar between men and women, whereas RRMS is more common in women.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that differentiating between PPMS and RRMS can be difficult, as it is not always clear where an individual patient falls on the spectrum of disease, and diagnostic tools for MS such as imaging methods and biomarkers aren\u2019t well established. The Committee noted that MS is a multifactorial disease, not simply a chronic inflammatory process, and that PPMS has similar pathophysiological features to SPMS. The Committee noted that current disease management costs associated with RRMS are higher than that of PPMS, as there are multiple targeted disease-modifying treatments available for RRMS and none for PPMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively targets B-cell expressing CD20 cells. The Committee noted that ocrelizumab is Medsafe approved, however the precise mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. The Committee noted that the PBAC (Australia) recommended ocrelizumab be declined for funding for the treatment of PPMS, but that it was recommended for funding by the CADTH (Canada), SMC (Scotland) and NICE (UK/Wales).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the Special Authority access criteria for ocrelizumab proposed by the supplier for the treatment of PPMS included initiation at an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2.0 (minimal disability in one functional system) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance (canes, crutches, or braces) required to walk about 20 metres without resting); with patients able to remain on treatment until they reach EDSS 8.5 (essentially restricted to bed much of the day, some effective use of arm(s), retains some self-care functions). The Committee noted that in the original application submitted for ocrelizumab for PPMS, the proposed stopping criteria had been EDSS 7.0. The Committee noted that under the proposed Special Authority, diagnosis of MS would require MRI confirmation, and a diagnosis of PPMS under the revised <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.22366\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2010 McDonald criteria</a>, which includes both clinical progression scoring and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the most appropriate comparator to ocrelizumab for PPMS was best supportive care, as there are no targeted treatments currently funded for this patient population. The Committee considered that the proposed outcome of reduction in the rate of disease progression as measured by EDSS score was appropriate, however that the role of MRI in measuring treatment outcomes was unclear. The Committee noted that ocrelizumab would be used in combination with intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg as a pre-infusion, with optional prophylaxis with analgesics or antipyretics and antihistamines pre-infusion as per the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">ORATORIO</a> trial protocol.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary results of the ORATORIO phase III, randomised (2:1), double-blind, parallel group, multicentre trial were reviewed by PTAC in 2018 (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Montalban et al, N Eng J Med 2017;376:209-20</a>). The Committee noted a long-term open-label extension of the ORATORIO trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33129442/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Wolinsky et al. Lancet Neurol. 2020;19:998-1009</a>) was included as part of the resubmission. The Committee noted that, according to trial protocol, blinded treatment in the trial continued until a benefit-risk assessment, at which point the patient allocation was unblinded. The Committee noted that patients were followed for at least 6.5 years, with 3.5 years in the open-label extension phase of the study, and that all analyses were post-hoc.</p><p>The Committee noted in long-term follow up evidence that patients in the ORATORIO study underwent a benefit-risk assessment at 144 weeks, at which point patients could cross-over from placebo to ocrelizumab. The Committee noted that the cross-over period was approximately 96 weeks. The Committee considered that the cross-over design produced results which indicated outcomes of delaying ocrelizumab treatment by possibly two years.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the results of the ORATORIO open-label extension trial indicate that treatment with ocrelizumab from the beginning of the trial suggested a decrease in disability progression (as determined by EDSS score) when compared with patients treated with placebo who crossed-over to ocrelizumab (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.89, p=0.0021). The Committee noted that the proportion of patients with EDSS \u22657 was lower in the ocrelizumab treatment group compared with the placebo/ocrelizumab group (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89, p=0.0112). The Committee noted that there were no new safety signals identified.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that disability from PPMS occurs twice as fast as in RRMS, with a median time to requiring a walking aid (EDSS 6) of 8-9 years, and median time to wheelchair use (EDSS 7) less than 20 years (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27794524/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Correale et al. Brain. 2017;140:527-46</a>). The Committee considered that the follow-up time of 6.5 years for the ORATORIO study was too short for what is a slow progressing disease such as PPMS and suggested that a 15-year follow-up would have been more appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the ORATORIO study used the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) Test and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) as measures of PPMS progression. The Committee noted that PPMS is a heterogeneous disease and that some patients may have lower limb disability without upper limb disability and vice versa; as such the Committee considered that the two tests may not be clinically meaningful descriptors of progression for all patients. The Committee noted that the proportion of patients having confirmed disability progression as per the T25FW test and the 9PHT was less in the ocrelizumab group compared with the placebo/crossover group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94 and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86, respectively).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there was no control group in the open-label extension phase of the trial, and that therefore there was potential for incorrect interpretation and reporting bias. The Committee also noted that there was no subgroup analysis of EDSS scores at the initiation of the study. The Committee noted that because most of the attrition and patient dropout in the trial occurred earlier in the double-blinded phase, this could lead to immortal time bias (ie. survival treatment selection bias) in favour of ocrelizumab and distort the generalisability of results.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence from ORATORIO open-label extension study for the use of ocrelizumab in the treatment of PPMS was weak and of low quality, primarily due to the lack of a control arm in the study. The Committee also noted that there was no health-related quality of life data reported, however that there is a well-known relationship between EDSS score and utility, thus quality of life scores can be surmised via EDSS score.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the patient number estimates of 265 patients per year for the first three years was appropriate. The Committee noted that there were no subgroup analyses in the ORATORIO study and considered that it was unclear if patients starting on ocrelizumab with a lower EDSS score would benefit more than those initiating treatment with a higher EDSS score. The Committee also considered that a stopping criterion of an EDSS score of 8.5 seemed high and was perhaps too far into disease progression for ocrelizumab to have appreciable benefit. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or MSTAC on appropriate EDSS scores, and other starting and stopping criteria for ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS. The Committee also considered that it would be beneficial to assess a cost-utility analysis comparing patients with low EDSS scores at onset (3 or lower) to patients with higher EDSS scores (4 or over) when initiating ocrelizumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted that it was unclear on the role of MRI surveillance throughout the treatment process, noting that MRI assessment was part of the protocol for surveillance in the ORATORIO study, which may not be practical in the New Zealand clinical setting, and considered PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or MSTAC on the role of MRI in MS treatment in this context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the supplier had provided an economic model with the assumption that median age for starting treatment on ocrelizumab would be 40 years old. The Committee noted that the median age in the ORATORIO study was 46, with a range of 18 to 56 years. The Committee was unclear if an addition of six years would make a difference to the modelling results and suggested that PHARMAC staff investigate this. The Committee also noted that the economic modelling included a relative risk of death for patients with MS set 2.89 times that of the expected age-normative probability of death in New Zealand, based on the reported standardised mortality ratio reported in a Canadian observational study, which was used in the PPMS specific model. (<a href=\"https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/83/1/61\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Kingwell et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2012;83:61-6</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that PPMS had higher relative mortality risk compared to RRMS (relative mortality ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.80), which should be factored into any economic modelling to further differentiate the health needs of patients with PPMS from RRMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.22366\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">McDonald criteria</a> are used for diagnosis of PPMS, and that one of the PPMS criteria is continued progression for one year (from previous symptoms or by ongoing observation). The Committee noted that waiting 12 months for a diagnosis may mean that patients with EDSS scores of 0 or 1 will progress to higher EDSS scores without having any funded treatment options. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or MSTAC on the appropriateness of waiting 12 months to initiate ocrelizumab treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the discontinuation rate in the ORATORIO study was 31% over the 6.5-year follow-up period (126 patients in the double-blinded phase, and 22 patients in the open-label extension phase). The Committee considered that the discontinuation rate was appropriate to inform PHARMAC\u2019s budget impact analysis. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, if funded, the uptake rate of ocrelizumab for PPMS would likely be 100%, as there are currently no alternative targeted treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee again noted the high health need of people with PPMS, the lack of funded treatment options and modest evidence of benefit of ocrelizumab for this indication, as demonstrated in a low-quality extension study. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or the MSTAC on appropriate Special Authority criteria.\u00a0</p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Committee noted a resubmission from Roche for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a funding application for ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS was reviewed and recommended for decline by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2018</a>. The Committee noted that at the time, it was considered that despite the high unmet health need in people with PPMS, there were significant concerns with the application, including a lack of data to establish both the safety and efficacy in this currently untreated group, and PTAC considered that the pivotal study (ORATORIO \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Montalban et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376(3):209-20</a>) that was reviewed may have had a bias in the estimate of effectiveness. The Committee noted at the time that more studies were ongoing, and likely to be completed and published in the near future, which may address some of these concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in June 2018, advice was sought from the Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Advisory Committee (MSTAC), which recommended that ocrelizumab be funded with a medium priority for PPMS with active inflammatory disease. PTAC noted that MSTAC had in turn noted that the ORATORIO trial population composition was unusual, with 25% having MR gadolinium enhancing lesions; however, MSTAC had considered that the trial publication\u2019s statistical analysis was appropriate and that it supported treatment for PPMS, particularly in those with gadolinium enhancing lesions. The Committee noted that in November 2018, PTAC noted MSTAC\u2019s recommendation, but still considered that more robust evidence of improved health outcomes was needed to change PTAC\u2019s previous recommendation that the application be declined.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that ocrelizumab has been funded since December 2019 for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subject to Special Authority criteria, and that all applications are currently assessed by the MSTAC.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by dysregulation of the peripheral immune system and leading to demyelination of neurons and subsequent neurodegeneration. The Committee noted that the majority (85-90%) of MS patients are diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Some of these patients may later develop into secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The remaining 10-15% of patients with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. Some data suggests that 12% of the NZ MS population has PPMS. The Committee noted that diagnosis of PPMS is often retrospective, and that patients often present with significant disability. The Committee noted that rates for PPMS are similar between men and women, whereas RRMS is more common in women.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that differentiating between PPMS and RRMS can be difficult, as it is not always clear where an individual patient falls on the spectrum of disease, and diagnostic tools for MS such as imaging methods and biomarkers aren\u2019t well established. The Committee noted that MS is a multifactorial disease, not simply a chronic inflammatory process, and that PPMS has similar pathophysiological features to SPMS. The Committee noted that current disease management costs associated with RRMS are higher than that of PPMS, as there are multiple targeted disease-modifying treatments available for RRMS and none for PPMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively targets B-cell expressing CD20 cells. The Committee noted that ocrelizumab is Medsafe approved, however the precise mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. The Committee noted that the PBAC (Australia) recommended ocrelizumab be declined for funding for the treatment of PPMS, but that it was recommended for funding by the CADTH (Canada), SMC (Scotland) and NICE (UK/Wales).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the Special Authority access criteria for ocrelizumab proposed by the supplier for the treatment of PPMS included initiation at an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2.0 (minimal disability in one functional system) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance (canes, crutches, or braces) required to walk about 20 metres without resting); with patients able to remain on treatment until they reach EDSS 8.5 (essentially restricted to bed much of the day, some effective use of arm(s), retains some self-care functions). The Committee noted that in the original application submitted for ocrelizumab for PPMS, the proposed stopping criteria had been EDSS 7.0. The Committee noted that under the proposed Special Authority, diagnosis of MS would require MRI confirmation, and a diagnosis of PPMS under the revised <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.22366\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2010 McDonald criteria</a>, which includes both clinical progression scoring and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the most appropriate comparator to ocrelizumab for PPMS was best supportive care, as there are no targeted treatments currently funded for this patient population. The Committee considered that the proposed outcome of reduction in the rate of disease progression as measured by EDSS score was appropriate, however that the role of MRI in measuring treatment outcomes was unclear. The Committee noted that ocrelizumab would be used in combination with intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg as a pre-infusion, with optional prophylaxis with analgesics or antipyretics and antihistamines pre-infusion as per the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">ORATORIO</a> trial protocol.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary results of the ORATORIO phase III, randomised (2:1), double-blind, parallel group, multicentre trial were reviewed by PTAC in 2018 (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606468\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Montalban et al, N Eng J Med 2017;376:209-20</a>). The Committee noted a long-term open-label extension of the ORATORIO trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33129442/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Wolinsky et al. Lancet Neurol. 2020;19:998-1009</a>) was included as part of the resubmission. The Committee noted that, according to trial protocol, blinded treatment in the trial continued until a benefit-risk assessment, at which point the patient allocation was unblinded. The Committee noted that patients were followed for at least 6.5 years, with 3.5 years in the open-label extension phase of the study, and that all analyses were post-hoc.</p><p>The Committee noted in long-term follow up evidence that patients in the ORATORIO study underwent a benefit-risk assessment at 144 weeks, at which point patients could cross-over from placebo to ocrelizumab. The Committee noted that the cross-over period was approximately 96 weeks. The Committee considered that the cross-over design produced results which indicated outcomes of delaying ocrelizumab treatment by possibly two years.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the results of the ORATORIO open-label extension trial indicate that treatment with ocrelizumab from the beginning of the trial suggested a decrease in disability progression (as determined by EDSS score) when compared with patients treated with placebo who crossed-over to ocrelizumab (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.89, p=0.0021). The Committee noted that the proportion of patients with EDSS \u22657 was lower in the ocrelizumab treatment group compared with the placebo/ocrelizumab group (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89, p=0.0112). The Committee noted that there were no new safety signals identified.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that disability from PPMS occurs twice as fast as in RRMS, with a median time to requiring a walking aid (EDSS 6) of 8-9 years, and median time to wheelchair use (EDSS 7) less than 20 years (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27794524/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Correale et al. Brain. 2017;140:527-46</a>). The Committee considered that the follow-up time of 6.5 years for the ORATORIO study was too short for what is a slow progressing disease such as PPMS and suggested that a 15-year follow-up would have been more appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the ORATORIO study used the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) Test and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) as measures of PPMS progression. The Committee noted that PPMS is a heterogeneous disease and that some patients may have lower limb disability without upper limb disability and vice versa; as such the Committee considered that the two tests may not be clinically meaningful descriptors of progression for all patients. The Committee noted that the proportion of patients having confirmed disability progression as per the T25FW test and the 9PHT was less in the ocrelizumab group compared with the placebo/crossover group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94 and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86, respectively).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there was no control group in the open-label extension phase of the trial, and that therefore there was potential for incorrect interpretation and reporting bias. The Committee also noted that there was no subgroup analysis of EDSS scores at the initiation of the study. The Committee noted that because most of the attrition and patient dropout in the trial occurred earlier in the double-blinded phase, this could lead to immortal time bias (ie. survival treatment selection bias) in favour of ocrelizumab and distort the generalisability of results.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence from ORATORIO open-label extension study for the use of ocrelizumab in the treatment of PPMS was weak and of low quality, primarily due to the lack of a control arm in the study. The Committee also noted that there was no health-related quality of life data reported, however that there is a well-known relationship between EDSS score and utility, thus quality of life scores can be surmised via EDSS score.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the patient number estimates of 265 patients per year for the first three years was appropriate. The Committee noted that there were no subgroup analyses in the ORATORIO study and considered that it was unclear if patients starting on ocrelizumab with a lower EDSS score would benefit more than those initiating treatment with a higher EDSS score. The Committee also considered that a stopping criterion of an EDSS score of 8.5 seemed high and was perhaps too far into disease progression for ocrelizumab to have appreciable benefit. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or MSTAC on appropriate EDSS scores, and other starting and stopping criteria for ocrelizumab for the treatment of PPMS. The Committee also considered that it would be beneficial to assess a cost-utility analysis comparing patients with low EDSS scores at onset (3 or lower) to patients with higher EDSS scores (4 or over) when initiating ocrelizumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted that it was unclear on the role of MRI surveillance throughout the treatment process, noting that MRI assessment was part of the protocol for surveillance in the ORATORIO study, which may not be practical in the New Zealand clinical setting, and considered PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or MSTAC on the role of MRI in MS treatment in this context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the supplier had provided an economic model with the assumption that median age for starting treatment on ocrelizumab would be 40 years old. The Committee noted that the median age in the ORATORIO study was 46, with a range of 18 to 56 years. The Committee was unclear if an addition of six years would make a difference to the modelling results and suggested that PHARMAC staff investigate this. The Committee also noted that the economic modelling included a relative risk of death for patients with MS set 2.89 times that of the expected age-normative probability of death in New Zealand, based on the reported standardised mortality ratio reported in a Canadian observational study, which was used in the PPMS specific model.

The Subcommittee noted in the ORATORIO trial that patients with EDSS scores of 3.0 to 6.5 were initiated on ocrelizumab. As such, the Subcommittee considered that an appropriate initial EDSS score to be eligible for funded ocrelizumab for PPMS should be between 2 and 6.5, and that this would target treatment to individuals who would benefit most from ocrelizumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was appropriate to require a person with PPMS to have experienced one or more years of disability progression prior to receiving funded treatment (as per the 2010 and 2017 McDonald criteria). Members considered that the requirement of EDSS 2.0 for treatment initiation would not disadvantage patients as very few people are diagnosed with PPMS at a lower EDSS state with disease duration under one year. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the 2017 McDonald criteria (as opposed to the 2010 McDonald criteria) would be the appropriate tool to guide diagnosis. Members noted that this version is used in current practice and the key change for PPMS diagnosis in the 2017 criteria (the removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions and the use of cortical lesions) was not a substantial difference. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is limited direct evidence of the use of ocrelizumab in PPMS patients with EDSS above 7.0, which in part is due to the small number of patients in this group in the ORATORIO trial. Members considered it is unlikely there will be further studies performed at higher EDSS levels. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier\u2019s resubmission requested that treatment be ceased once an EDSS of 8.5 was reached. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the outcomes observed in lower EDSS states may apply to patients at higher EDSS level noting potential biological plausibility, however that this was conjecture. Members noted that individuals with PPMS and higher EDSS states ie. &gt;7.5) are more likely to be elderly, Members considered that this would likely impact the ability for treatment to occur in day-case units and may result in longer admission for infusions. The Subcommittee also noted that the risk-benefit of potential adverse events (eg. severe infection) from ocrelizumab compared to the benefit that would be had at higher EDSS states would need to be carefully balanced for older individuals and/or those with high EDSS scores. However, Members also noted that even small benefits from treatment, particularly related to upper limb function were highly valuable and clinically meaningful for individuals with high EDSS scores due to the loss of lower limb mobility. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that an appropriate renewal EDSS score would be 6.5, ie. that a patient would not be eligible to continue on funded treatment once an EDSS of 7.0 or greater was reached. The Subcommittee noted that this was in line with the main clinical trial entrance criteria (EDSS up to 6.5). The Subcommittee considered that consideration of a higher EDSS renewal (eg. 8.5 as requested by the supplier), would be inappropriate with the current lack of evidence to inform benefit. Members noted that a requirement of \u2018no progression\u2019 should not be required for continued treatment with ocrelizumab due to the inherently progressive nature of PPMS, even with treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that any discrepancy between renewal EDSS in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and PPMS criteria may be contentious, particularly if not supported with relevant evidence. The Subcommittee acknowledged that the renewal criteria for MS treatments are in place to manage the high cost of treatment; although Members noted that treating MS indefinitely was not necessarily best practice. </p><p><br></p><p>MRI</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that MRIs are currently used in the diagnosis of PPMS but are not used regularly throughout the treatment process (unlike RRMS). The Subcommittee considered there are currently no issues with access to MRI for PPMS diagnosis, however some patients may experience delays in MRI. Members noted that if ocrelizumab were funded for PPMS that patients would be monitored for tolerability, safety and clinical effect by consultation rather than by MRI. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, if ocrelizumab were funded for PPMS, the supplier estimated that access to MRI scanning would limit eligibility by 50%. The Subcommittee considered that this would not be the case, however that if the Special Authority criteria required patients to have gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline to access funded treatment, that this would reduce the eligible population. However, the Subcommittee noted that gadolinium-enhancing lesions were not included in the 2017 McDonald criteria and considered as such that it should not be an eligibility requirement for access to funded ocrelizumab.</p><p><br></p><p>General</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the disease management costs (excluding pharmaceuticals) for each EDSS health state associated with PPMS were broadly similar to that of patients with RRMS. The Subcommittee also noted there may be different patterns of disability at lower EDSS due to relapses with incomplete recovery in RRMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided two estimates for the elevated mortality of PPMS patients compared with the expected age-normative probability of death in NZ, based on results reported in a Canadian observational study (<a href=\"https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/83/1/61\" target=\"_blank\">Kingwell et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2012;83:61-6</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the revised mortality estimate provided by the supplier in 2020, compared with 2018, provided cost effectiveness results that were heavily impacted by patients pooling and spending considerable time in an EDSS 9 health state and incurring significant health sector costs. The Subcommittee considered the mortality estimate provided by the supplier in 2020 is likely to be inaccurate beyond two years. The Subcommittee considered the median time spend in EDSS bands in the Welsh data was more reasonable (<a href=\"https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(18)30268-2/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Harding et al.

The Subcommittee noted in the ORATORIO trial that patients with EDSS scores of 3.0 to 6.5 were initiated on ocrelizumab. As such, the Subcommittee considered that an appropriate initial EDSS score to be eligible for funded ocrelizumab for PPMS should be between 2 and 6.5, and that this would target treatment to individuals who would benefit most from ocrelizumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was appropriate to require a person with PPMS to have experienced one or more years of disability progression prior to receiving funded treatment (as per the 2010 and 2017 McDonald criteria). Members considered that the requirement of EDSS 2.0 for treatment initiation would not disadvantage patients as very few people are diagnosed with PPMS at a lower EDSS state with disease duration under one year. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the 2017 McDonald criteria (as opposed to the 2010 McDonald criteria) would be the appropriate tool to guide diagnosis. Members noted that this version is used in current practice and the key change for PPMS diagnosis in the 2017 criteria (the removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions and the use of cortical lesions) was not a substantial difference. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is limited direct evidence of the use of ocrelizumab in PPMS patients with EDSS above 7.0, which in part is due to the small number of patients in this group in the ORATORIO trial. Members considered it is unlikely there will be further studies performed at higher EDSS levels. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier\u2019s resubmission requested that treatment be ceased once an EDSS of 8.5 was reached. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the outcomes observed in lower EDSS states may apply to patients at higher EDSS level noting potential biological plausibility, however that this was conjecture. Members noted that individuals with PPMS and higher EDSS states ie. &gt;7.5) are more likely to be elderly, Members considered that this would likely impact the ability for treatment to occur in day-case units and may result in longer admission for infusions. The Subcommittee also noted that the risk-benefit of potential adverse events (eg. severe infection) from ocrelizumab compared to the benefit that would be had at higher EDSS states would need to be carefully balanced for older individuals and/or those with high EDSS scores. However, Members also noted that even small benefits from treatment, particularly related to upper limb function were highly valuable and clinically meaningful for individuals with high EDSS scores due to the loss of lower limb mobility. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that an appropriate renewal EDSS score would be 6.5, ie. that a patient would not be eligible to continue on funded treatment once an EDSS of 7.0 or greater was reached. The Subcommittee noted that this was in line with the main clinical trial entrance criteria (EDSS up to 6.5). The Subcommittee considered that consideration of a higher EDSS renewal (eg. 8.5 as requested by the supplier), would be inappropriate with the current lack of evidence to inform benefit. Members noted that a requirement of \u2018no progression\u2019 should not be required for continued treatment with ocrelizumab due to the inherently progressive nature of PPMS, even with treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that any discrepancy between renewal EDSS in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and PPMS criteria may be contentious, particularly if not supported with relevant evidence. The Subcommittee acknowledged that the renewal criteria for MS treatments are in place to manage the high cost of treatment; although Members noted that treating MS indefinitely was not necessarily best practice. </p><p><br></p><p>MRI</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that MRIs are currently used in the diagnosis of PPMS but are not used regularly throughout the treatment process (unlike RRMS). The Subcommittee considered there are currently no issues with access to MRI for PPMS diagnosis, however some patients may experience delays in MRI. Members noted that if ocrelizumab were funded for PPMS that patients would be monitored for tolerability, safety and clinical effect by consultation rather than by MRI. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, if ocrelizumab were funded for PPMS, the supplier estimated that access to MRI scanning would limit eligibility by 50%. The Subcommittee considered that this would not be the case, however that if the Special Authority criteria required patients to have gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline to access funded treatment, that this would reduce the eligible population. However, the Subcommittee noted that gadolinium-enhancing lesions were not included in the 2017 McDonald criteria and considered as such that it should not be an eligibility requirement for access to funded ocrelizumab.</p><p><br></p><p>General</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the disease management costs (excluding pharmaceuticals) for each EDSS health state associated with PPMS were broadly similar to that of patients with RRMS. The Subcommittee also noted there may be different patterns of disability at lower EDSS due to relapses with incomplete recovery in RRMS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided two estimates for the elevated mortality of PPMS patients compared with the expected age-normative probability of death in NZ, based on results reported in a Canadian observational study (<a href=\"https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/83/1/61\" target=\"_blank\">Kingwell et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2012;83:61-6</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the revised mortality estimate provided by the supplier in 2020, compared with 2018, provided cost effectiveness results that were heavily impacted by patients pooling and spending considerable time in an EDSS 9 health state and incurring significant health sector costs. The Subcommittee considered the mortality estimate provided by the supplier in 2020 is likely to be inaccurate beyond two years. The Subcommittee considered the median time spend in EDSS bands in the Welsh data was more reasonable (<a href=\"https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(18)30268-2/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Harding et al. Mult Scler Relat Disord. 2018;25:186-191</a>). Overall, the Subcommittee considered the 2018 mortality rates and time spent in each EDSS health state to be more plausible.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ocrelizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for PPMS. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000000qXcm&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001sKWB\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
