The Advisory Group reiterated this was an area of rapidly evolving evidence and knowledge and identified that its recommendation may need to be reconsidered in the future, noting this was based on currently available data from published studies and could be subject to change should new data become available, warranting further review. </p><p><br></p><p>1.8. The Advisory Group noted that ivermectin is a semi-synthetic macrocyclic lactone with a broad-spectrum antiparasitic activity, which binds with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride channels causing an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarisation of the nerve or muscle cell. </p><p><br></p><p>1.9. The Advisory Group noted that the potential mechanism of action for ivermectin as an antiviral against COVID-19 is currently unknown. </p><p><br></p><p>1.10. The Advisory Group noted that ivermectin is available in New Zealand as a 3 mg tablet and dosing for the treatment of parasitic infections is in multiples of 3 mg depending on body weight and the severity of infection being treated. </p><p><br></p><p>1.11. The Advisory Group noted that the dosing of ivermectin in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 is variable and was approximately 150 mcg to 200 mcg per kg twice per day for up to 5 days. </p><p><br></p><p>1.12. The Advisory Group noted that in routine, single dose treatments of parasitic infections, side effects from ivermectin are relatively uncommon, however the Group acknowledged that safety data for the use of ivermectin as a preventative treatment over longer periods of time (as it would be used in the treatment of COVID-19) was not available. </p><p><br></p><p>1.13. The Advisory Group considered clinical evidence for ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19:</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.1. The Group noted that a number of meta-analyses had been undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19. The Group noted an article by Rothrock, Weber Giordano et al 2022, which concluded that the poor design of these meta-analyses and the limitations of the component studies were sufficiently appreciable to invalidate findings that use of ivermectin was associated with reduced mortality from COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.13.2. The Group noted a Cochrane review of trials up to 26 May 2021 (Popp et al. CDSR 2021;7:CD015017). The authors reported very low to low certainty of evidence for the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the treatment of patients hospitalised or in outpatient settings with COVID-19, and concluded that the available evidence did not support the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19. The Group noted this review did not include the most recent studies, and considered that treatments for COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving area and data continues to emerge.</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.3. The Group noted a sub group meta-analysis of trials for ivermectin in COVID-19 to assess the effects of stratifying by trial quality on the overall results (Hill, Mirchandani and Pilkington et al. 2022), which reported that when all 12 studies evaluated in the meta-analysis were included, the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 was associated with a 51% increase in survival. However, excluding all trials considered to be fraudulent or at risk of bias, resulted in no material increase in survival associated with ivermectin use.</p><p><br></p><p>1.14. The Advisory Group considered recent studies for ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 which were undertaken subsequent to Popp et al 2021 and not identified by Hill, Mirchandani and Pilkington et al 2022 as being at risk of bias. These included: </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.1. Efficacy and safety of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 Buonfrate et al 2022 COVER Study: A randomised, investigator-initiated, double-blind, multicentre, phase II, dose-finding, proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of high doses of ivermectin in reducing viral load in individuals with early SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatient settings. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (arm A) 600 mg/kg/day (Arm b) or 1200 mg/kg/day (arm C) for 5 days (n=93). Mean (S.D.) log10 viral load reduction was 2.9 (1.6) in arm C, 2.5 (2.2) in arm B and 2.0 (2.1) in arm A, (P = 0.099 and 0.122 for C vs. A and B vs. A, respectively). High dose ivermectin was safe but did not show efficacy to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.2. Prophylaxis against COVID-19 Bartoszko, Siemieniuk, Kum, et al, 2021: A living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating the effects of prophylactic treatments on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, which reported that the effects of ivermectin alone and in combination with iota-carrageenan as a prophylactic treatment against COVID-19 remains very uncertain with 50 and 52 fewer COVID-19 infections per 1000 people respectively compared to placebo. The meta-analysis reported serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, leading to low certainty of evidence regarding the effectiveness of ivermectin alone and combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory confirmed COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.3. Inpatients with COVID-19 at risk of severe disease Lim et al 2022 (ITech Study): A multicentre, open-label, randomised clinical trial conducted at 20 government hospitals and a COVID-19 quarantine centre in Malaysia between May 31 and October 25, 2021 to evaluate the effects of oral ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg/day for five days) plus standard of care in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were 50 years or older with at least 1 comorbidity and presented with mild to moderate illness within 7 days from symptom onset (n=490). Among the 490 patients, 95 (19.4%) progressed to severe disease during the study period; 52 of 241 (21.6%) received ivermectin plus standard of care, and 43 of 249 (17.3%) received standard of care alone (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.87-1.80; P\u2009=0.25). There were no statistically significant differences between ivermectin and control groups for all the prespecified secondary outcomes. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.4. Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 infection Ravikirti et al 2021: A double blind, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial between August and 31 October 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of oral ivermectin (12 mg/day administered on day 1 and 2 post enrolment) in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (n=112); On 6th day, 23.6% of patients in the intervention arm and 31.6% in the placebo arm tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [RR: 0.8; 95%, CI: 0.4 -1.4; p=0.348]; Mechanical ventilation was required for 1.8% of patients in the intervention arm and 8.8% of patients in the placebo arm [RR: 0.2; 95%CI: 0.0-1.7; (p=0.102)]; No patients in the intervention arm but 7% of patients (n=4) in the placebo arm died [RR: 1.1; 95% CI; 1.0-1.2; p=0.045)]. </p><p><br></p><p>1.15. The Advisory Group considered that the strength and quality of evidence supporting the use of ivermectin in the treatment COVID-19 was very low based on available publications. The Group noted that overall, the studies evaluating the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 were small and did not consider factors such as vaccination, social isolation and mask wearing. In addition, many of the studies had been undertaken in less developed countries where social distancing has not been implemented. As a result of these factors the Group considered that many of the studies evaluating the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 were at risk of bias. The Group noted there was no evidence for the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and its various subvariants, and the Group considered there would be no benefit from the use of ivermectin for the current treatment of COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.16. The Advisory Group noted that it was aware that a small number of people may be using ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Members raised concerns that if ivermectin were to be funded for the treatment of COVID-19 in New Zealand there was a risk that sufficient supply may not be available for currently funded indications for which there is clinical evidence of benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>1.17. The Advisory Group noted that internationally ivermectin has not been approved for use or funded for the treatment of COVID-19. This included jurisdictions with comparable assessment and regulatory environments to New Zealand including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United States of America. In addition, the Group noted the public statement from Merk Sharpe &amp; Dome, the manufacturer of ivermectin, that it does not support the use of ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID-19, noting there is no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies and there is no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease. </p><p><br></p><p>1.18. The Group noted that in New Zealand the Ministry of Health and Medsafe have strongly recommended that, on the basis of the evidence available, ivermectin should not be used in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Prophylaxis against COVID-19 Bartoszko, Siemieniuk, Kum, et al, 2021: A living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating the effects of prophylactic treatments on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, which reported that the effects of ivermectin alone and in combination with iota-carrageenan as a prophylactic treatment against COVID-19 remains very uncertain with 50 and 52 fewer COVID-19 infections per 1000 people respectively compared to placebo. The meta-analysis reported serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, leading to low certainty of evidence regarding the effectiveness of ivermectin alone and combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory confirmed COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.3. Inpatients with COVID-19 at risk of severe disease Lim et al 2022 (ITech Study): A multicentre, open-label, randomised clinical trial conducted at 20 government hospitals and a COVID-19 quarantine centre in Malaysia between May 31 and October 25, 2021 to evaluate the effects of oral ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg/day for five days) plus standard of care in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were 50 years or older with at least 1 comorbidity and presented with mild to moderate illness within 7 days from symptom onset (n=490). Among the 490 patients, 95 (19.4%) progressed to severe disease during the study period; 52 of 241 (21.6%) received ivermectin plus standard of care, and 43 of 249 (17.3%) received standard of care alone (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.87-1.80; P\u2009=0.25). There were no statistically significant differences between ivermectin and control groups for all the prespecified secondary outcomes. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.4. Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 infection Ravikirti et al 2021: A double blind, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial between August and 31 October 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of oral ivermectin (12 mg/day administered on day 1 and 2 post enrolment) in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (n=112); On 6th day, 23.6% of patients in the intervention arm and 31.6% in the placebo arm tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [RR: 0.8; 95%, CI: 0.4 -1.4; p=0.348]; Mechanical ventilation was required for 1.8% of patients in the intervention arm and 8.8% of patients in the placebo arm [RR: 0.2; 95%CI: 0.0-1.7; (p=0.102)]; No patients in the intervention arm but 7% of patients (n=4) in the placebo arm died [RR: 1.1; 95% CI; 1.0-1.2; p=0.045)]. </p><p><br></p><p>1.15. The Advisory Group considered that the strength and quality of evidence supporting the use of ivermectin in the treatment COVID-19 was very low based on available publications. The Group noted that overall, the studies evaluating the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 were small and did not consider factors such as vaccination, social isolation and mask wearing. In addition, many of the studies had been undertaken in less developed countries where social distancing has not been implemented. As a result of these factors the Group considered that many of the studies evaluating the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 were at risk of bias. The Group noted there was no evidence for the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and its various subvariants, and the Group considered there would be no benefit from the use of ivermectin for the current treatment of COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.16. The Advisory Group noted that it was aware that a small number of people may be using ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Members raised concerns that if ivermectin were to be funded for the treatment of COVID-19 in New Zealand there was a risk that sufficient supply may not be available for currently funded indications for which there is clinical evidence of benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>1.17. The Advisory Group noted that internationally ivermectin has not been approved for use or funded for the treatment of COVID-19. This included jurisdictions with comparable assessment and regulatory environments to New Zealand including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United States of America. In addition, the Group noted the public statement from Merk Sharpe &amp; Dome, the manufacturer of ivermectin, that it does not support the use of ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID-19, noting there is no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies and there is no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease. </p><p><br></p><p>1.18. The Group noted that in New Zealand the Ministry of Health and Medsafe have strongly recommended that, on the basis of the evidence available, ivermectin should not be used in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>1.6. The Advisory Group noted that no priority ranking (within the context of treatments for COVID-19) was sought by Pharmac, reflecting the rapidly evolving evidence for treatments in COVID-19 and separate funding outside the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget, and therefore did not need to discuss a priority ranking.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7. The Advisory Group reiterated this was an area of rapidly evolving evidence and knowledge and identified that its recommendation may need to be reconsidered in the future, noting this was based on currently available data from published studies and could be subject to change should new data become available, warranting further review. </p><p><br></p><p>1.8. The Advisory Group noted that ivermectin is a semi-synthetic macrocyclic lactone with a broad-spectrum antiparasitic activity, which binds with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride channels causing an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarisation of the nerve or muscle cell. </p><p><br></p><p>1.9. The Advisory Group noted that the potential mechanism of action for ivermectin as an antiviral against COVID-19 is currently unknown. </p><p><br></p><p>1.10. The Advisory Group noted that ivermectin is available in New Zealand as a 3 mg tablet and dosing for the treatment of parasitic infections is in multiples of 3 mg depending on body weight and the severity of infection being treated. </p><p><br></p><p>1.11. The Advisory Group noted that the dosing of ivermectin in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 is variable and was approximately 150 mcg to 200 mcg per kg twice per day for up to 5 days. </p><p><br></p><p>1.12. The Advisory Group noted that in routine, single dose treatments of parasitic infections, side effects from ivermectin are relatively uncommon, however the Group acknowledged that safety data for the use of ivermectin as a preventative treatment over longer periods of time (as it would be used in the treatment of COVID-19) was not available. </p><p><br></p><p>1.13. The Advisory Group considered clinical evidence for ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19:</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.1. The Group noted that a number of meta-analyses had been undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19. The Group noted an article by Rothrock, Weber Giordano et al 2022, which concluded that the poor design of these meta-analyses and the limitations of the component studies were sufficiently appreciable to invalidate findings that use of ivermectin was associated with reduced mortality from COVID-19. </p><p><br></p><p>1.13.2. The Group noted a Cochrane review of trials up to 26 May 2021 (Popp et al. CDSR 2021;7:CD015017). The authors reported very low to low certainty of evidence for the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the treatment of patients hospitalised or in outpatient settings with COVID-19, and concluded that the available evidence did not support the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19. The Group noted this review did not include the most recent studies, and considered that treatments for COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving area and data continues to emerge.</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.3. The Group noted a sub group meta-analysis of trials for ivermectin in COVID-19 to assess the effects of stratifying by trial quality on the overall results (Hill, Mirchandani and Pilkington et al. 2022), which reported that when all 12 studies evaluated in the meta-analysis were included, the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 was associated with a 51% increase in survival. However, excluding all trials considered to be fraudulent or at risk of bias, resulted in no material increase in survival associated with ivermectin use.</p><p><br></p><p>1.14. The Advisory Group considered recent studies for ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 which were undertaken subsequent to Popp et al 2021 and not identified by Hill, Mirchandani and Pilkington et al 2022 as being at risk of bias. These included: </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.1. Efficacy and safety of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 Buonfrate et al 2022 COVER Study: A randomised, investigator-initiated, double-blind, multicentre, phase II, dose-finding, proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of high doses of ivermectin in reducing viral load in individuals with early SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatient settings. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (arm A) 600 mg/kg/day (Arm b) or 1200 mg/kg/day (arm C) for 5 days (n=93). Mean (S.D.) log10 viral load reduction was 2.9 (1.6) in arm C, 2.5 (2.2) in arm B and 2.0 (2.1) in arm A, (P = 0.099 and 0.122 for C vs. A and B vs. A, respectively). High dose ivermectin was safe but did not show efficacy to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load. </p><p><br></p><p>1.14.2.
