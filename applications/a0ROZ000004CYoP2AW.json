The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p>8.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1st line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (Blacklock et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19:10,sE213).</p><p>8.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that transplant eligibility was usually considered based on physiological fitness and that transplants are usually received by people under the age of 70. The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p>8.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>8.11.1.1.\tthe lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>8.11.1.2.\tthe inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>8.11.1.3.\taccess to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p>8.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. B J Haem. 2018;182:513-20).\u00a0</p><p>8.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that approximately 10-20% of patients currently do not respond to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) and that this estimate would be relevant to both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p>8.14.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p>8.15.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>8.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens.\u00a0</p><p>8.18.\tThe Subcommittee considered that in the 2nd line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line.\u00a0</p><p>8.19.\tThe Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients.</p><p><br></p><p>Lenalidomide for transplant eligible patients</p><p>8.20.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in 2018, it had considered that there was insufficient evidence to support the application for lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for ASCT and thus deferred any recommendation until this became available (CaTSoP April 2018). The Subcommittee noted that since its last review, further evidence regarding the use of lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVD) as transplant induction therapy had been generated and that the use of RVD in this setting had become the standard of care in many countries.</p><p>8.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there would be no concern with the use of lenalidomide in the absence of Medsafe approval, because it is used extensively in the first line setting in other countries.</p><p>8.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted the importance of achieving at least a partial response prior to receiving an autologous stem cell transplant. The Subcommittee noted the results of the Pethema/GEM2012 trial, which included 458 patients aged less than 65 years. In this trial, patients received 6 cycles of RVD as induction therapy, followed by 2 cycles of RVD consolidation post ASCT (Rosinol et al. Blood. 2019;134:1337-45). The Subcommittee noted that response rates to RVD in this trial were similar to that of patients receiving VTD in the previous GEM2005 trial, but that the depth of response was greater for patients receiving RVD in the Pethema/GEM2012 trial and the proportion of patients with a very good partial response increased with each cycle of RVD, and considered this to be clinically relevant for this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.23.\tThe Subcommittee noted a retrospective review comparing RVD with CyBorD in the first line setting (Utervall et al. J. Haematology. 2019;103:247-54). The Subcommittee considered that the patient groups receiving RVD or CyBorD were similar in this retrospective review. The Subcommittee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a partial response with RVD compared to CyBorD were 98% and 88% respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months (88% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.001) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee noted that the OS at 18 months (95% vs. 89%; p=0.048) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee also noted that the outcomes were similar for patients regardless of whether they ended up receiving a transplant or not.\u00a0</p><p>8.24.\tThe Subcommittee noted a randomised, phase 2 trial (EVOLUTION) that compared RVD with CyBorD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma (Kumar et al. Blood. 2012;119(19):4375-82). The Subcommittee noted that this trial reported no difference in PFS, however the Subcommittee considered that the study was not sufficiently powered to be able to detect a difference due to the number of patients included in each treatment arm. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients who obtained a partial response and very good partial response was numerically greater in patients receiving RVD compared with CyBorD, and considered that this trend aligned with the results of other trials in this patient population.\u00a0</p><p>8.25.\tThe Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). These guidelines indicate that the optimal treatment regimen and cycle duration remain unproven, but that optimal treatment includes the combination of an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor and a corticosteroid.</p><p>8.26.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there is limited evidence to support a benefit of RVD compared to the current standard of care (CyBorD). The Subcommittee however considered that the available evidence supports a benefit for RVD compared to current treatment options, and that this is primarily driven by the rates of response and depth of response, which is considered important for patients progressing to an ASCT.</p><p>8.27.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of the IFM2009 trial, in which patients were randomised to receive induction therapy with three cycles of RVD and then consolidation therapy with either five additional cycles of RVD or high-dose melphalan plus stem-cell transplantation followed by two additional cycles of RVD (Attal et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376:1311-20). The Subcommittee noted that while the response rates differed significantly between the two treatment groups, there was no difference in OS between the two groups. The Subcommittee noted that the results of the long term follow up of this trial indicated no impact of delaying ASCT in this patient group (Perrot et al. ASH 2020:134538).</p><p>8.28.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to use to evaluate the OS and PFS for RVD in transplant eligible patients was from the Pethema/GEM2012 and IFM2009 trials.\u00a0</p><p>8.29.\tThe Subcommittee considered that funding RVD might result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib.\u00a0</p><p>8.30.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, uptake would be high, and RVD would be used by approximately 90% of incident newly diagnosed, transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients.</p><p>8.31.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to specify the maximum number of cycles, due to the potential otherwise for delayed transplant for this patient group as a means of managing the fiscal risk of funding lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee considered that while it would be appropriate to limit the number of cycles to 8 cycles prior to transplant, specifying the funded regimen may not be appropriate, given the likely variation in use of lenalidomide in this setting.</p><p>8.32.\tThe Subcommittee considered that lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (RD) was not an appropriate induction regimen for patients eligible for transplant and is not recommended in international guidelines (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). The Subcommittee considered that while there is no direct comparative data, it noted a review, which included a cross trial comparison, which indicated that RD is inferior to the current standard of care (CyBorD and BTD) when considering the treatment response rates achieved with commonly used induction regimens in patients with multiple myeloma (Kumar. Med Oncol. 2010;27(Suppl 1):S14-24).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The Subcommittee noted the results of the Pethema/GEM2012 trial, which included 458 patients aged less than 65 years. In this trial, patients received 6 cycles of RVD as induction therapy, followed by 2 cycles of RVD consolidation post ASCT (Rosinol et al. Blood. 2019;134:1337-45). The Subcommittee noted that response rates to RVD in this trial were similar to that of patients receiving VTD in the previous GEM2005 trial, but that the depth of response was greater for patients receiving RVD in the Pethema/GEM2012 trial and the proportion of patients with a very good partial response increased with each cycle of RVD, and considered this to be clinically relevant for this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.23.\tThe Subcommittee noted a retrospective review comparing RVD with CyBorD in the first line setting (Utervall et al. J. Haematology. 2019;103:247-54). The Subcommittee considered that the patient groups receiving RVD or CyBorD were similar in this retrospective review. The Subcommittee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a partial response with RVD compared to CyBorD were 98% and 88% respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months (88% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.001) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee noted that the OS at 18 months (95% vs. 89%; p=0.048) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee also noted that the outcomes were similar for patients regardless of whether they ended up receiving a transplant or not.\u00a0</p><p>8.24.\tThe Subcommittee noted a randomised, phase 2 trial (EVOLUTION) that compared RVD with CyBorD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma (Kumar et al. Blood. 2012;119(19):4375-82). The Subcommittee noted that this trial reported no difference in PFS, however the Subcommittee considered that the study was not sufficiently powered to be able to detect a difference due to the number of patients included in each treatment arm. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients who obtained a partial response and very good partial response was numerically greater in patients receiving RVD compared with CyBorD, and considered that this trend aligned with the results of other trials in this patient population.\u00a0</p><p>8.25.\tThe Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). These guidelines indicate that the optimal treatment regimen and cycle duration remain unproven, but that optimal treatment includes the combination of an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor and a corticosteroid.</p><p>8.26.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there is limited evidence to support a benefit of RVD compared to the current standard of care (CyBorD). The Subcommittee however considered that the available evidence supports a benefit for RVD compared to current treatment options, and that this is primarily driven by the rates of response and depth of response, which is considered important for patients progressing to an ASCT.</p><p>8.27.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of the IFM2009 trial, in which patients were randomised to receive induction therapy with three cycles of RVD and then consolidation therapy with either five additional cycles of RVD or high-dose melphalan plus stem-cell transplantation followed by two additional cycles of RVD (Attal et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376:1311-20). The Subcommittee noted that while the response rates differed significantly between the two treatment groups, there was no difference in OS between the two groups. The Subcommittee noted that the results of the long term follow up of this trial indicated no impact of delaying ASCT in this patient group (Perrot et al. ASH 2020:134538).</p><p>8.28.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to use to evaluate the OS and PFS for RVD in transplant eligible patients was from the Pethema/GEM2012 and IFM2009 trials.\u00a0</p><p>8.29.\tThe Subcommittee considered that funding RVD might result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib.\u00a0</p><p>8.30.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, uptake would be high, and RVD would be used by approximately 90% of incident newly diagnosed, transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients.</p><p>8.31.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to specify the maximum number of cycles, due to the potential otherwise for delayed transplant for this patient group as a means of managing the fiscal risk of funding lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee considered that while it would be appropriate to limit the number of cycles to 8 cycles prior to transplant, specifying the funded regimen may not be appropriate, given the likely variation in use of lenalidomide in this setting.</p><p>8.32.\tThe Subcommittee considered that lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (RD) was not an appropriate induction regimen for patients eligible for transplant and is not recommended in international guidelines (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). The Subcommittee considered that while there is no direct comparative data, it noted a review, which included a cross trial comparison, which indicated that RD is inferior to the current standard of care (CyBorD and BTD) when considering the treatment response rates achieved with commonly used induction regimens in patients with multiple myeloma (Kumar. Med Oncol. 2010;27(Suppl 1):S14-24).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>Multiple myeloma</p><p>8.8.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 400 incident cases of myeloma in New Zealand each year and that this was increasing. The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p>8.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1st line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (Blacklock et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19:10,sE213).</p><p>8.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that transplant eligibility was usually considered based on physiological fitness and that transplants are usually received by people under the age of 70. The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p>8.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>8.11.1.1.\tthe lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>8.11.1.2.\tthe inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>8.11.1.3.\taccess to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p>8.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. B J Haem. 2018;182:513-20).\u00a0</p><p>8.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that approximately 10-20% of patients currently do not respond to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) and that this estimate would be relevant to both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p>8.14.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p>8.15.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>8.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens.\u00a0</p><p>8.18.\tThe Subcommittee considered that in the 2nd line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line.\u00a0</p><p>8.19.\tThe Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients.</p><p><br></p><p>Lenalidomide for transplant eligible patients</p><p>8.20.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in 2018, it had considered that there was insufficient evidence to support the application for lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for ASCT and thus deferred any recommendation until this became available (CaTSoP April 2018).

The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (<a href=\"https://www.multiplemyeloma.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Burden-of-Myeloma-Humand-And-Economic-Costs_Digital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (<a href=\"https://www.multiplemyeloma.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Burden-of-Myeloma-Humand-And-Economic-Costs_Digital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1<sup>st</sup> line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (<a href=\"https://www.clinical-lymphoma-myeloma-leukemia.com/article/S2152-2650(19)31741-0/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Blacklock et al.

The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>1.4.1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>1.4.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>1.4.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>access to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjh.15426\" target=\"_blank\">Costa et al.

The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in the 2<sup>nd</sup> line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients.<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">[LH1]</a><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">\u00a0</span></p><p><i>Lenalidomide for transplant eligible patients</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in 2018, it had considered that there was insufficient evidence to support the application for lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for ASCT and thus deferred any recommendation until this became available (<a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptqe/p000072\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP April 2018</a>). The Subcommittee noted that since its last review, further evidence regarding the use of lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVD) as transplant induction therapy had been generated and that the use of RVD in this setting had become the standard of care in many countries.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be no concern with the use of lenalidomide in the absence of Medsafe approval, because it is used extensively in the first line setting in other countries.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the importance of achieving at least a partial response prior to receiving an autologous stem cell transplant. The Subcommittee noted the results of the Pethema/GEM2012 trial, which included 458 patients aged less than 65 years. In this trial, patients received 6 cycles of RVD as induction therapy, followed by 2 cycles of RVD consolidation post ASCT (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31484647/\" target=\"_blank\">Rosinol et al. Blood. 2019;134:1337-45</a>). The Subcommittee noted that response rates to RVD in this trial were similar to that of patients receiving VTD in the previous GEM2005 trial, but that the depth of response was greater for patients receiving RVD in the Pethema/GEM2012 trial and the proportion of patients with a very good partial response increased with each cycle of RVD, and considered this to be clinically relevant for this patient group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a retrospective review comparing RVD with CyBorD in the first line setting (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejh.13280\" target=\"_blank\">Utervall et al. J. Haematology. 2019;103:247-54</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the patient groups receiving RVD or CyBorD were similar in this retrospective review. The Subcommittee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a partial response with RVD compared to CyBorD were 98% and 88% respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months (88% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.001) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee noted that the OS at 18 months (95% vs. 89%; p=0.048) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee also noted that the outcomes were similar for patients regardless of whether they ended up receiving a transplant or not. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a randomised, phase 2 trial (EVOLUTION) that compared RVD with CyBorD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma (<a href=\"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/119/19/4375/30004/Randomized-multicenter-phase-2-study-EVOLUTION-of\" target=\"_blank\">Kumar et al. Blood. 2012;119(19):4375-82</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this trial reported no difference in PFS, however the Subcommittee considered that the study was not sufficiently powered to be able to detect a difference due to the number of patients included in each treatment arm. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients who obtained a partial response and very good partial response was numerically greater in patients receiving RVD compared with CyBorD, and considered that this trend aligned with the results of other trials in this patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932732/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63</a>). These guidelines indicate that the optimal treatment regimen and cycle duration remain unproven, but that optimal treatment includes the combination of an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor and a corticosteroid.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is limited evidence to support a benefit of RVD compared to the current standard of care (CyBorD). The Subcommittee however considered that the available evidence supports a benefit for RVD compared to current treatment options, and that this is primarily driven by the rates of response and depth of response, which is considered important for patients progressing to an ASCT.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the IFM2009 trial, in which patients were randomised to receive induction therapy with three cycles of RVD and then consolidation therapy with either five additional cycles of RVD or high-dose melphalan plus stem-cell transplantation followed by two additional cycles of RVD (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1611750\" target=\"_blank\">Attal et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376:1311-20</a>). The Subcommittee noted that while the response rates differed significantly between the two treatment groups, there was no difference in OS between the two groups. The Subcommittee noted that the results of the long term follow up of this trial indicated no impact of delaying ASCT in this patient group (<a href=\"https://ash.confex.com/ash/2020/webprogram/Paper134538.html\" target=\"_blank\">Perrot et al. ASH 2020:134538</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to use to evaluate the OS and PFS for RVD in transplant eligible patients was from the Pethema/GEM2012 and IFM2009 trials. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that funding RVD might result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, uptake would be high, and RVD would be used by approximately 90% of incident newly diagnosed, transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to specify the maximum number of cycles, due to the potential otherwise for delayed transplant for this patient group as a means of managing the fiscal risk of funding lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee considered that while it would be appropriate to limit the number of cycles to 8 cycles prior to transplant, specifying the funded regimen may not be appropriate, given the likely variation in use of lenalidomide in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (RD) was not an appropriate induction regimen for patients eligible for transplant and is not recommended in international guidelines (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932732/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63</a>). The Subcommittee considered that while there is no direct comparative data, it noted a review, which included a cross trial comparison, which indicated that RD is inferior to the current standard of care (CyBorD and BTD) when considering the treatment response rates achieved with commonly used induction regimens in patients with multiple myeloma (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20035387/\" target=\"_blank\">Kumar.

The Subcommittee noted that response rates to RVD in this trial were similar to that of patients receiving VTD in the previous GEM2005 trial, but that the depth of response was greater for patients receiving RVD in the Pethema/GEM2012 trial and the proportion of patients with a very good partial response increased with each cycle of RVD, and considered this to be clinically relevant for this patient group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a retrospective review comparing RVD with CyBorD in the first line setting (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejh.13280\" target=\"_blank\">Utervall et al. J. Haematology. 2019;103:247-54</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the patient groups receiving RVD or CyBorD were similar in this retrospective review. The Subcommittee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a partial response with RVD compared to CyBorD were 98% and 88% respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months (88% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.001) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee noted that the OS at 18 months (95% vs. 89%; p=0.048) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD.

The Subcommittee noted that this trial reported no difference in PFS, however the Subcommittee considered that the study was not sufficiently powered to be able to detect a difference due to the number of patients included in each treatment arm. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients who obtained a partial response and very good partial response was numerically greater in patients receiving RVD compared with CyBorD, and considered that this trend aligned with the results of other trials in this patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932732/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63</a>).

The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (<a href=\"https://www.multiplemyeloma.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Burden-of-Myeloma-Humand-And-Economic-Costs_Digital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (<a href=\"https://www.multiplemyeloma.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Burden-of-Myeloma-Humand-And-Economic-Costs_Digital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations.

The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>1.4.1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>1.4.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>1.4.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>access to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjh.15426\" target=\"_blank\">Costa et al.

The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in the 2<sup>nd</sup> line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients.<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">[LH1]</a><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">\u00a0</span></p><p><i>Lenalidomide for transplant eligible patients</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in 2018, it had considered that there was insufficient evidence to support the application for lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for ASCT and thus deferred any recommendation until this became available (<a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptqe/p000072\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP April 2018</a>). The Subcommittee noted that since its last review, further evidence regarding the use of lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVD) as transplant induction therapy had been generated and that the use of RVD in this setting had become the standard of care in many countries.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be no concern with the use of lenalidomide in the absence of Medsafe approval, because it is used extensively in the first line setting in other countries.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the importance of achieving at least a partial response prior to receiving an autologous stem cell transplant. The Subcommittee noted the results of the Pethema/GEM2012 trial, which included 458 patients aged less than 65 years. In this trial, patients received 6 cycles of RVD as induction therapy, followed by 2 cycles of RVD consolidation post ASCT (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31484647/\" target=\"_blank\">Rosinol et al.

J. Haematology. 2019;103:247-54</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the patient groups receiving RVD or CyBorD were similar in this retrospective review. The Subcommittee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a partial response with RVD compared to CyBorD were 98% and 88% respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months (88% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.001) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD. The Subcommittee noted that the OS at 18 months (95% vs. 89%; p=0.048) was greater for patients receiving RVD compared to CyBorD.

The Subcommittee noted that this trial reported no difference in PFS, however the Subcommittee considered that the study was not sufficiently powered to be able to detect a difference due to the number of patients included in each treatment arm. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients who obtained a partial response and very good partial response was numerically greater in patients receiving RVD compared with CyBorD, and considered that this trend aligned with the results of other trials in this patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932732/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63</a>).

The Subcommittee noted that while the response rates differed significantly between the two treatment groups, there was no difference in OS between the two groups. The Subcommittee noted that the results of the long term follow up of this trial indicated no impact of delaying ASCT in this patient group (<a href=\"https://ash.confex.com/ash/2020/webprogram/Paper134538.html\" target=\"_blank\">Perrot et al. ASH 2020:134538</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to use to evaluate the OS and PFS for RVD in transplant eligible patients was from the Pethema/GEM2012 and IFM2009 trials. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that funding RVD might result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, uptake would be high, and RVD would be used by approximately 90% of incident newly diagnosed, transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to specify the maximum number of cycles, due to the potential otherwise for delayed transplant for this patient group as a means of managing the fiscal risk of funding lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee considered that while it would be appropriate to limit the number of cycles to 8 cycles prior to transplant, specifying the funded regimen may not be appropriate, given the likely variation in use of lenalidomide in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (RD) was not an appropriate induction regimen for patients eligible for transplant and is not recommended in international guidelines (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932732/\" target=\"_blank\">Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63</a>). The Subcommittee considered that while there is no direct comparative data, it noted a review, which included a cross trial comparison, which indicated that RD is inferior to the current standard of care (CyBorD and BTD) when considering the treatment response rates achieved with commonly used induction regimens in patients with multiple myeloma (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20035387/\" target=\"_blank\">Kumar.
