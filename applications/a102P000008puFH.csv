<p>In November 2021, we introduced separate terms of reference for the SACs to make clear that these committees have different, but complementary, roles, expertise and perspectives to PTAC.</p>

The Subcommittee considered that the trial therefore did not compare benefit with ABCP versus ACP; and as a consequence, statistical analysis of the benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to the triplet of ACP was not forthcoming from IMpower150. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">1.4.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had previously reviewed results from IMpower150, where it was reported that OS in the intention-to-treat population of 45.1% with ABCP compared with 35.5% with BCP (HR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.93) and noted that an additional 10% of patients were alive at 2 years with ABCP (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30922878/"" target=""_blank"">Reck et al.

The Committee considered that if one of these treatments were to be funded for advanced NSCLC, this would result in a significant increment in numbers of people both at implementation and with conditional survival improvements, leading to increased pressure on infusion services.

The Committee considered that, due to hierarchical testing, the third arm of IMPOWER 131 is unable to be reported. The Committee considered that the evidence for ACP vs CP relies on data provided by IMPOWER 130, however the chemotherapy arm is nab-paclitaxel, not paclitaxel. The Committee considered that the relevance of the evidence supporting the benefit of atezolizumab +/- bevacizumab combination therapy to the New Zealand setting to be poor.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the data for atezolizumab +/- bevacizumab combination therapy for advanced squamous NSCLC is very limited, and that the advanced squamous NSCLC data available is largely extrapolated and the OS benefit is not proven. The Committee however considered that IMPOWER 110 may provide additional support for the use of atezolizumab in squamous NSCLC. The Committee considered that, given the paucity of evidence of health benefit in the advanced squamous NSCLC population, atezolizumab would pragmatically provide a similar health benefit to that seen in the advanced non-squamous NSCLC population, however the evidence is poor, and this is uncertain.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the role of bevacizumab when used in combination with atezolizumab and chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC is unclear, and that the benefit of ABCP over CP is not yet proven. The Committee also considered that, if ABCP were to be funded, bevacizumab would not be given to those with advanced squamous NSCLC due to the risk of haemoptysis. The Committee also considered that the addition of bevacizumab would add significant chair time, as well as increased toxicity and monitoring requirements.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the reason for the differences in outcomes between the atezolizumab and pembrolizumab trials, despite using the same chemotherapy regimens, is unknown. It was considered that the cause for these inconsistencies may be a result of nuances around the heterogeneity of the populations (eg IMPOWER 132 was not stratified for PD1 status), selection of the chemotherapies, or ethnicity demographics leading to differences in outcome (eg KEYNOTE 402 2% Asian, IMPOWER 132 25% Asian).</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the additional survival data provided by Roche does not resolve the Committee’s previous concerns regarding the quality and strength of the evidence for atezolizumab +/- bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Need </em></h3><p>1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the health need for this population to be high, in line with its considerations at previous meetings. The Committee considered that those receiving combination chemotherapy alongside immunotherapy would need to be of good performance status.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Suitability </em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a key issue for New Zealand Blood and Cancer Centres is the pressure on infusion services, including infrastructure and staffing, compounding space and staffing, and medical staff. The Committee considered that if one of these treatments were to be funded for advanced NSCLC, this would result in a significant increment in numbers of people both at implementation and with conditional survival improvements, leading to increased pressure on infusion services. The Committee also considered that infusion times with increasing numbers of agents included in regimens would exacerbate the burden on infusion services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the shelf life of the treatments to be crucial in terms of equity of access. The Committee considered that a minimum of 24 hours (ideally 7 days) stability is required for pressured compounding and day unit infusion services. Members however considered that stability data may vary between compounding facilities depending on the availability of stability data. The Committee noted the lack of stability data for tislelizumab and considered this may result in implementation issues.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it would be preferable for the treatment to have the widest dosing interval as possible, ideally with the option for widening treatment intervals to beyond 3 weeks. The Committee also considered that toxicity of treatments is likely to add to pressures on the health sector by creating a need for outpatient medical review and inpatient care.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding an ICI for first-line combination therapy for advanced NSCLC will increase health sector expenditure due to the increased impact on infusion services and management of toxicities related to treatment.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that approximately 25-30% of individuals who have disease progression on chemotherapy would receive docetaxel as a subsequent treatment.

Members considered that RECIST is not an ideal measure for lung tumour burden, that radiologist availability and cost are factors which can create barriers, and that it is challenging to have consistent assessment. However, the Committee noted the need to document disease burden at baseline to enable subsequent assessment.</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Require confirmation that there is no evidence of disease progression at renewal, and that it would be important that the same modality was used to establish response to treatment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary for Assessment</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab, atezolizumab +/- bevacizumab, nivolumab + ipilimumab and tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy, if each were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
