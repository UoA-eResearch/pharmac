The Committee noted that approximately 96% of COPD cases are in those over the age of 45, making the population prevalence of severe and ever-hospitalised COPD 1.9% in people aged 45 and over.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific populations have higher rates of COPD at 3.7 times and 2.8 times the non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific and non-Asian rate (non-MPA), respectively. Members noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific populations also have higher rates of morbidity and mortality, and develop COPD significantly earlier: the average age of M\u0101ori with COPD was 63.4 years, compared with 66.2 for Pacific peoples, 69.7 for Asian peoples, and 73.3 for individuals with other ethnicities (Barnard and Zhang, The Impact of Respiratory Disease in New Zealand: 2016 update).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a high degree of inequity across both the socio-economic spectrum and different ethnic groups has been observed for COPD. The Committee noted that COPD rates are 5.7 times higher in the most deprived NZDep quintile than in the least deprived, with the gradient persisting across M\u0101ori, Pacific, Asian and non-MPA ethnic groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Trelegy Ellipta contains an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in one inhaler. Members noted that Trelegy Ellipta contains 100mcg fluticasone furoate, 62.5mcg umeclidinium bromide and 25mcg vilanterol trifenatate, powder for inhalation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that prior to 2016, LABA and ICS (as single inhalers or in combination) were easier to access/prescribe than LAMA (which required severe COPD confirmed by spirometry), which may have meant that ICS has been prescribed inappropriately for patients with mild-moderate COPD.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee reviewed the NICE 2018 guidelines (NICE 2018. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management: www.nice.org.uk/NG115) for non-pharmacological management and use of inhaled therapies for COPD and noted that the treatment paradigm steps up from 1. short-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists(SABA)/short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), then 2. LAMA, LABA, both LAMA and LABA used in combination, and only then 3. an ICS is introduced. The Committee noted that the use of ICS in COPD management is less clear than LABA and LAMA therapy, and noted that most guidelines advise triple therapy for severe COPD (GOLD D: \u22652 courses of oral steroids per year or \u22651 hospital admission per year and more symptoms [mMRC\u2265 2 or CAT\u2265 10]). Members noted that the use of ICS in COPD is associated with higher rates of pneumonia.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: rgb(62, 62, 60); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Committee noted the supplier has advised that the pivotal evidence for the use of Trelegy Ellipta is provided by the IMPACT trial (Lipson et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1671-80). Members noted that the IMPACT trial was a large Phase 3 randomised control trial of high quality. The Committee noted that the trial compared triple therapy with FF/UMEC /VI (ICS + LAMA + LABA) vs dual therapy with VI/FF (LABA + ICS) or with UMEC/VI (LAMA + LABA) and each intervention was administered in a single Ellipta inhaler. The Committee considered that dual therapy was the wrong comparator for the study and the appropriate comparator would have been triple therapy administered as separate components. Members noted that the rate of moderate or severe exacerbation per year was 0.91 with triple therapy vs 1.07 (FF + VI, p&lt;0.001) vs\u00a01.21 (UMEC + VI, p&lt;0.001), and the mean change from baseline trough forced expiratory volume (FEV1) between ICS/LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA was 97ml and LAMA/LABA was 54ml (noting that the minimal clinically important difference [MCID] was 100 mLs).</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee reviewed the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from the Lipson et al publication and noted that the mean change from baseline was -5.5 for triple therapy vs -3.7 for both dual therapy combinations, noting that the Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) was 5 on 0-100 score. Members noted that the rate of pneumonia was more than 50% higher with ICS-containing inhalers than with the LAMA/LABA combination (9.6 vs. 6.1 per 100 patient-years). Members noted that a greater reduction in exacerbation rate with triple therapy was observed for patients with eosinophils &gt;150 cells/\u00b5L.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that 38% of patients enrolled in the trial were already receiving treatment with triple therapy and approximately 70% were receiving an inhaled glucocorticoid prior to enrolment. Members noted that patients with a history of asthma were included, and considered that of the LAMA/LABA group, many would have abruptly stopped their ICS at randomization. Members considered this could explain the early upsurge in exacerbations in that group and may explain the finding that ICS/LABA group had fewer exacerbations than the LAMA/LABA group, which is a different finding than was reported in the FLAME trial (Wedzicha et al. N Eng J Med. 2016;374:2222-34).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee also reviewed the results of the FULFIL trial (Lipson et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2017;196:438-46) that compared once daily triple therapy as Trelegy vs twice daily FF/budesonide (ICS + LABA). Members noted that mean changes from baseline in FEV1 were 142 ml for patients administered Trelegy vs -29 ml for patients administered the dual therapy, and mean changes from baseline in St George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores were -6.6 and -4.3, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there are numerous ICS, LABA, LAMA, LABA/LAMA and ICS/LAMA inhalers listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule that would have the same effect as Trelegy when used in appropriate combinations, and therefore funding Trelegy would not address an unmet health need.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the patient number estimates provided by the supplier were underestimated and considered that over 50% of patients with COPD currently on triple therapy would be likely to change to a single inhaler.</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that there is some evidence from an open-label, sponsor-designed, cross-over study that reported patient preference, reduced instruction time and less critical errors (errors likely to result in no or significantly reduced medication being inhaled) with the Ellipta inhaler device (van der Palen et al. Int J of COPD. 2018;13:2515-23).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee reviewed a non-inferiority study of once daily FF/VI /UMEC (using a single inhaler) vs FF/VI and UMEC (using two inhalers) and noted that the single inhaler was found to be non-inferior to treatment with two inhalers in change from baseline of trough FEV1 after 24 weeks, and secondary endpoints, including exacerbation rates and HR-QoL (Bremner et al. Respir Res. 2018;19:19).</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that patients with severe (GOLD D) COPD that are mixing up their inhalers may benefit from a single inhaler therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there are risks of side-effects, including pneumonia, with high dose ICS and noted that the fluticasone foroate 100 mcg provided per inhalation in the Trelegy inhaler is equal to 500 mcg fluticasone proprionate and would therefore be considered a very high dose of ICS.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was some clinical concern regarding triple therapy, and noted that an editorial by Suissa and Drazen, (N Eng J Med. 2018:378:1723-24) cautions that \u201calthough single-inhaler triple therapy offers simplicity in treating COPD, any potential benefit could be lost and potential undue harm induced if triple therapy is expanded to patients with GOLD groups A, B, and C COPD\u201d.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered a double-blind, parallel group study (the Withdrawal of Inhaled Steroids during Optimized Bronchodilator Management [WISDOM] trial) (Magnussen et al. N Eng J Med. 2014;271:1285-94) investigating whether patients with COPD receiving both LAMA and LABA therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids would have similar outcomes regardless of whether the glucocorticoids were withdrawn or continued. Members noted that there was no difference in the primary end point of exacerbations but a significant 43 mL (MCID 100ml) mean fall in FEV1 after ICS withdrawal and no difference in pneumonia incidence. The Committee noted that post hoc analysis revealed a 43% increase in exacerbations after ICS withdrawal in those patients who had blood eosinophils of at least 300 cells/\u00b5L in conjunction with two or more exacerbations in the past year, whereas there was no difference in patients with eosinophils less than 300 cells/\u00b5L.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was high quality (GRADE 1) evidence that Trelegy is superior to dual therapy with ICS/LABA and LAMA/LAMA for rate of exacerbations, minor improvements in HRQoL and trough FEV1 favouring Trelegy. However, Members considered that the pivotal trial does not answer the question of how Trelegy compares to triple therapy with multiple inhalers for severe COPD, as is standard of care in NZ at present.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee acknowledged that severe COPD impacts on the quality of life for family/whanau but considered that there was no evidence that single inhaler therapy produces health benefit for family/whanau/society over multiple inhalers.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is a risk is that prescribers/patients will switch to the single inhaler product, resulting in reduced opportunities for savings on other inhaled medicines for COPD that could be used to invest in other medicines. Members considered that the all in one triple therapy inhaler would not provide an added health benefit that is not addressed through currently funded products, and no premium should be paid for the combined product.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that Trelegy Ellipta would be used in combination with short-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist inhalers, intermittent oral corticosteroids and with or without antibiotics. Members noted that Trelegy Ellipta would replace dual inhalers for patients already on triple therapy (ICS/LABA + LAMA combination or ICS + LAMA/LABA combination) and raised concern that it would replace LAMA/LABA as step up therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that Trelegy Ellipta would not be appropriate as an initial therapy for COPD and considered that if it were to be open listed, patients with mild to moderate COPD would be starting on treatment with an ICS. The Committee requested that PHARMAC seek advice from the Respiratory Subcommittee to whether Special Authority criteria should be put in place to restrict use to COPD patients with severe disease to prevent inappropriate prescribing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was no evidence base to support device delivery systems as a way to improve equity in COPD. Members considered that there are a number of other issues that are more important to address, such as accessibility of pulmonary rehabilitation programs, influenza vaccination, education, access to services and smoking cessation. Members were not convinced that adherence arguments could be used as a substitute for real life outcomes and considered that if adherence made a huge difference to COPD outcomes, that this would be reflected in the trials.</p>",

The Committee noted that approximately 96% of COPD cases are in those over the age of 45, making the population prevalence of severe and ever-hospitalised COPD 1.9% in people aged 45 and over.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific populations have higher rates of COPD at 3.7 times and 2.8 times the non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific and non-Asian rate (non-MPA), respectively. Members noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific populations also have higher rates of morbidity and mortality, and develop COPD significantly earlier: the average age of M\u0101ori with COPD was 63.4 years, compared with 66.2 for Pacific peoples, 69.7 for Asian peoples, and 73.3 for individuals with other ethnicities (Barnard and Zhang, The Impact of Respiratory Disease in New Zealand: 2016 update).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a high degree of inequity across both the socio-economic spectrum and different ethnic groups has been observed for COPD. The Committee noted that COPD rates are 5.7 times higher in the most deprived NZDep quintile than in the least deprived, with the gradient persisting across M\u0101ori, Pacific, Asian and non-MPA ethnic groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Trelegy Ellipta contains an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in one inhaler. Members noted that Trelegy Ellipta contains 100mcg fluticasone furoate, 62.5mcg umeclidinium bromide and 25mcg vilanterol trifenatate, powder for inhalation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that prior to 2016, LABA and ICS (as single inhalers or in combination) were easier to access/prescribe than LAMA (which required severe COPD confirmed by spirometry), which may have meant that ICS has been prescribed inappropriately for patients with mild-moderate COPD.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee reviewed the NICE 2018 guidelines (NICE 2018. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management: www.nice.org.uk/NG115) for non-pharmacological management and use of inhaled therapies for COPD and noted that the treatment paradigm steps up from 1. short-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists(SABA)/short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), then 2. LAMA, LABA, both LAMA and LABA used in combination, and only then 3. an ICS is introduced. The Committee noted that the use of ICS in COPD management is less clear than LABA and LAMA therapy, and noted that most guidelines advise triple therapy for severe COPD (GOLD D: \u22652 courses of oral steroids per year or \u22651 hospital admission per year and more symptoms [mMRC\u2265 2 or CAT\u2265 10]). Members noted that the use of ICS in COPD is associated with higher rates of pneumonia.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: rgb(62, 62, 60); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Committee noted the supplier has advised that the pivotal evidence for the use of Trelegy Ellipta is provided by the IMPACT trial (Lipson et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1671-80). Members noted that the IMPACT trial was a large Phase 3 randomised control trial of high quality. The Committee noted that the trial compared triple therapy with FF/UMEC /VI (ICS + LAMA + LABA) vs dual therapy with VI/FF (LABA + ICS) or with UMEC/VI (LAMA + LABA) and each intervention was administered in a single Ellipta inhaler. The Committee considered that dual therapy was the wrong comparator for the study and the appropriate comparator would have been triple therapy administered as separate components. Members noted that the rate of moderate or severe exacerbation per year was 0.91 with triple therapy vs 1.07 (FF + VI, p&lt;0.001) vs\u00a01.21 (UMEC + VI, p&lt;0.001), and the mean change from baseline trough forced expiratory volume (FEV1) between ICS/LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA was 97ml and LAMA/LABA was 54ml (noting that the minimal clinically important difference [MCID] was 100 mLs).</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee reviewed the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from the Lipson et al publication and noted that the mean change from baseline was -5.5 for triple therapy vs -3.7 for both dual therapy combinations, noting that the Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) was 5 on 0-100 score. Members noted that the rate of pneumonia was more than 50% higher with ICS-containing inhalers than with the LAMA/LABA combination (9.6 vs. 6.1 per 100 patient-years). Members noted that a greater reduction in exacerbation rate with triple therapy was observed for patients with eosinophils &gt;150 cells/\u00b5L.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that 38% of patients enrolled in the trial were already receiving treatment with triple therapy and approximately 70% were receiving an inhaled glucocorticoid prior to enrolment. Members noted that patients with a history of asthma were included, and considered that of the LAMA/LABA group, many would have abruptly stopped their ICS at randomization. Members considered this could explain the early upsurge in exacerbations in that group and may explain the finding that ICS/LABA group had fewer exacerbations than the LAMA/LABA group, which is a different finding than was reported in the FLAME trial (Wedzicha et al.

The Subcommittee however considered that there may be the potential for improved adherence to treatment and decreased patient costs due to only having to use and pay the co-payment for one inhaler instead of two or three inhalers.

The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate comparator for FF/UMEC/VI is the same components delivered via multiple inhalers (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate 100/25 [Breo Ellipta] in combination with the umeclidinium [Incruse Ellipta]). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific people are evidenced to have a high burden of disease for COPD compared to non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific people. The Subcommittee considered that a single inhaler triple therapy would contribute to reducing the barriers to access for population groups known to be experiencing inequities such as M\u0101ori, Pacific and people from more socioeconomically deprived areas (for example by needing to pay a only single co-payment when collecting their prescription). In addition, the Subcommittee considered that the reduction in complexity due to the provision of triple therapy from a single inhaler may provide additional benefit.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the correspondence provided by the supplier in response to the 2019 PTAC recommendation, presenting updated clinical evidence for FF/UMEC/VI in this patient population. </p><p><br></p><p>1.4.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a Phase III, randomised, double-blind trial (IMPACT trial) of patients aged 40 years or older with symptomatic COPD (n=10,355) who were randomised 2:2:1 to FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mg, FF/VI 100/25 mg, or UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mg following a run-in on their COPD therapies over 52 weeks (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668352\" target=\"_blank\">Lipson et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1671-80</a>), in which the incidence of moderate or severe exacerbations per year was 0.91 with FF/UMEC/VI vs 1.07 with FF/VI (p&lt;0.001) vs 1.21 with UMEC/VI (p&lt;0.001), and the rate of hospitalisation per year was 0.13 with FF/UMEC/VI vs 0.15 with FF/VI (p&lt;0.06) vs 0.19 with UMEC/VI (p&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc analysis of the IMPACT trial investigating all-cause mortality (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32162970/\" target=\"_blank\">Lipson et al.

The Subcommittee considered that any benefit that could be attributed to improved adherence in a trial is difficult to extrapolate to everyday clinical settings.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence that multiple device types have a negative association with correct handling technique and patient adherence. The Subcommittee noted that, historically, when multi-therapy single inhalers have reached reach cost-neutrality, they have been favoured over regimens including the same components from multiple inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that having more than one device increases the chance of critical errors, and that different devices, brands, concentrations, and formulations can be confusing for both prescribers and patients which may perpetuate adherence problems. The Subcommittee considered that, if adherence was improved through use of a single inhaler triple therapy regimen, that there is a potential for decrease in cost associated with COPD exacerbations and hospitalisations. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that most COPD patients currently receiving triple therapy would likely switch to a single-inhaler regimen if available. The Subcommittee considered that a key driver for uptake of FF/UMEC/VI would be if clinicians considered that a single inhaler would help improve control for patients currently symptomatic while receiving an ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA dual therapy. As a result, the Subcommittee considered that patients numbers may exceed the current estimate of 14-19,000 patients, which is the estimated number of prevalent patients currently receiving a triple therapy regimen. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important that the Special Authority criteria for FF/UMEC/VI prevent patients from automatically switching to triple therapy when treatment with an ICS may not be an appropriate treatment option.</p>",

The Committee noted the Subcommittee\u2019s recommendation to fund fluticasone furoate with umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate if it was cost-neutral to the pricing of the same components received from multiple inhalers (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate 100/25 [Breo Ellipta] in combination with umeclidinium [Incruse Ellipta]) within the context of respiratory disease. The Committee considered that the Respiratory Subcommittee\u2019s recommendation was more appropriate and agreed with its recommendation, and considered that it would be important for patients currently receiving triple therapy via multiple inhalers to be eligible for fluticasone furoate with umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate, if funded.</p>",
