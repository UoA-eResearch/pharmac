The Subcommittee noted that the onset of AML is usually rapid, with presentation and diagnosis occurring within weeks of the onset of symptoms (Estey E &amp; Döhner H. Lancet. 2006;368:1894-907)</p><p>5.5.\tThe Subcommittee noted that AML is a relatively rare type of cancer but is the most common type of acute leukaemia diagnosed in New Zealand adults, and accounts for the largest number of deaths from leukaemia in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that the majority of patients present with complications of pancytopenia (low counts for all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and bone marrow failure such as anaemia (e.g. fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches, pale skin, or shortness of breath), thrombocytopenia (e.g. bruising, excess bleeding such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds) and neutropenia (e.g. persistent and recurrent infections often accompanied with fever) or the clinical consequences of leukostasis due to an extremely high white blood cell count (e.g., difficulty breathing, confusion, and decreased consciousness).</p><p>5.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted evidence reporting that Māori have an increased risk of AML (risk ratio 1.5 in the age group 25-49 and risk ratio 1.3 in the age group 50-74), relative to New Zealand Caucasians (Tracey &amp; Carter. Am J Haematol. 2005;79:114-8). The Subcommittee also noted that a recent study reported that Māori and Pacific people appeared to present with AML at a younger age than individuals of European descent (Chan et al. Blood. 2020;136:36-37. Abstract only) and that individuals of European descent were significantly older at diagnosis compared to other ethnicities (median of 70 years vs. 51 for Māori and 56 for Pacific peoples, and 58 for all other ethnicities, p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the age of a patient at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival. Despite AML presenting at a younger age in Māori people, the higher incidence of comorbidities in the Māori population would result in Māori having a higher likelihood of being ineligible for intensive chemotherapy after diagnosis.\xa0</p><p>5.7.\tThe Subcommittee noted that Chan et al. also reported that AML appears to disproportionately affect those who live in more socio-economically deprived areas (NZDep2013), with 23% of cases reported in the most deprived 20% of the population, compared with 16% of the cases in the least deprived 20%, and that socio-economic deprivation was also an adverse prognostic factor.\xa0</p><p>5.8.\tThe Subcommittee considered that patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy constitutes approximately 50% of newly diagnosed AML patients (approximately 60 - 70 patients per year). The Subcommittee noted that newly diagnosed AML patients currently undertake intensive induction chemotherapy , or low intensity therapy (azacitidine or low dose cytarabine (LoDAC)) if intensive chemotherapy is unsuitable.\xa0</p><p>5.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the adverse features of AML in those patients ineligible for induction chemotherapy (including those with adverse cytogenetics and/or comorbidities) are particularly difficult to treat, with poor outcomes in patients receiving low-intensity therapies in terms of achieving remission, quality of life improvements and long-term survival, and that patients considered ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy experience much lower rates of complete remission than patients eligible for induction chemotherapy.\xa0</p><p>5.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that venetoclax is an orally bioavailable, selective small molecule inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma-2 protein (BCL-2), an anti-apoptotic protein which is Medsafe approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.\xa0</p><p>5.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted that azacitidine can be administered either subcutaneously or via an intravenous infusion for 7 consecutive days within a 28-day cycle for 6 cycles before a response is observed, and continued for longer if the patient responds. The Subcommittee considered that most patients who respond are likely to do so within 4-6 cycles. LoDAC can be self-administered (twice daily) by the patient/caregiver in the community, which minimises the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility. The Subcommittee considered that because of its stability post constitution, it can be more readily administered by patient or carer in the community without regular day ward attendance.</p><p>5.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted that azacitidine is funded for patients with AML, 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia and that LoDAC is open listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule. The Subcommittee considered that azacitidine and LoDAC monotherapies are associated with very poor survival rates in newly diagnosed patients with AML who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy.\xa0</p><p>5.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the burden and manual dexterity needed to give (subcutaneous) azacitidine therapy, in combination with its instability once thawed (which necessitates that it be freshly made for each administration), may not be feasible for some patients, in particular those residing in rural and remote areas with greater limitations on accessing specialist treatment facilities. The Subcommittee noted that this may impact up to 15% of the AML population in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to ensure that all patients eligible for azacitidine would be able to receive it.\xa0</p><p>5.14.\tThe Subcommittee noted the pivotal evidence to support the proposed widening of access to venetoclax in this application from two phase III randomised trials:\xa0</p><p>5.14.1.\t\tDiNardo et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383:617-29 (M15-656 (VIALE-A) trial): a phase III, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of 431 patients with newly diagnosed AML ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy (due to age or comorbidities) who received either venetoclax in combination with azacitidine) (azacitidine 75 mg per square metre of body-surface area subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1 to 7 every 28-day cycle; venetoclax 400 mg orally once daily in 28-day cycles; N=286) or azacitidine with matching placebo (N=145).\xa0</p><p>5.14.2.\tVenetoclax in combination with azacitidine, compared to azacitidine with placebo, resulted in a significantly improved: median overall survival (14.7 months vs 9.6 months, respectively; HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85; P&lt;0.001), composite complete remission rates (66.4% vs. 28.3%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), transfusion independence for both red blood cells (59.8% vs 35.2%, respectively; P&lt;0.001) and platelets (68.5% vs 49.7%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), and median event-free survival (9.8 months vs 7.0 months, respectively; HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001).\xa0</p><p>5.14.3.\tThe venetoclax treated group experienced an increased incidence of notable serious adverse events, notably grade 3, or higher, febrile neutropenia (30% in the venetoclax group vs 10% in the control group) and grade 3, or higher, pneumonia (16% in the venetoclax group vs 22% in the control group), with 1% of patients in the venetoclax group experiencing tumour lysis syndrome. The mortality at 30 days was similar between the two groups (6% in the venetoclax group vs 7% in the control group).\xa0</p><p>5.14.4.\tWei et al. Blood. 2020;135:2137-45 (M16-043 (VIALE-C) trial): a phase III double-blind randomised controlled trial of 211 patients with previously untreated AML who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy who received either venetoclax with LoDAC (venetoclax dosing began at 100 mg on day 1 and increased stepwise over 4 days to reach the target dose of 600 mg; LoDAC 20 mg/m2 subcutaneous injection once daily on days 1 to 10 in all cycles; N=143) or LoDAC with matching placebo (N=68).\xa0</p><p>5.14.5.\tVenetoclax in combination with LoDAC, compared to LoDAC with placebo, resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival (8.4 months vs 4.1 months, respectively; HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; P=0.40), composite complete response rates (47.6% vs 13.2%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), transfusion independence for both red blood cells (41% vs 18%, respectively; P=0.001) and platelets (48% vs 32%, respectively; P=0.40), and median event-free survival (4.7 months vs 2.0 months, respectively; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.82; P=0.002).</p><p>5.14.6.\tThe venetoclax treated group experienced a higher incidence of serious adverse events, such as febrile neutropenia (16% in the venetoclax group vs 18% in the placebo group) and pneumonia (13% in the venetoclax group vs 10% in the placebo group). There were also more serious bleeding events in patients receiving venetoclax (11%) compared to the placebo group (7%). There were 8 instances of tumour lysis syndrome, all in the venetoclax treated group.\xa0</p><p>5.15.\t\tThe Subcommittee considered that the trials were of high strength and good quality and showed the benefit of venetoclax in combination with either azacitidine or LoDAC, compared to azacitidine or LoDAC monotherapy. The Subcommittee however noted that the survival outcomes in the VIALE-A trial were more compelling than those experienced in the VIALE-C trial. The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to widen access to azacitidine to afford the outcomes observed in the VIALE-A trial.</p><p>5.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the VIALE-A and VIALE-C trials included patients with all subtypes of AML (including those with poor cytogenetic risk, secondary AML, and unfavourable blast counts) and indicated a benefit from treatment with venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or LoDAC, even for patients with p53 mutations which usually have a poorer outlook. The Subcommittee considered that the event-free and overall survival outcomes from VIALE-A and VIALE-C would be applicable to the New Zealand population.\xa0</p><p>5.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted the Dombret et al. study in a patient population with AML with &gt;30% blasts which indicated that the overall survival for azacitidine in this patient group was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 12.7 months), and that outcomes with LoDAC are generally worse than with azacitidine (Dombret H, et al. Blood. 2015;126(3):291-9). The Subcommittee noted that the outcomes observed in this patient population were similar to that observed in the control arm of the VIALE-A trial.\xa0</p><p>5.18.\tThe Subcommittee noted that. The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct comparison of venetoclax with azacitidine and venetoclax with LoDAC but considered that because the patient demographics of each trial were similar, comparison of outcomes between the trials would be reasonable. Hence, it was reasonable to deduce that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine was the most effective therapeutic approach for this population and that the lack of azacitidine resulted in inferior outcomes. The Subcommittee considered that the worse outcomes of venetoclax with LoDAC were considered attributable to the relative inefficacy of LoDAC compared to azacitidine.</p><p>5.19.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there are likely to be significant quality-of-life benefits from not being dependent on red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions, and that these benefits should be included in subsequent cost-effectiveness analyses for venetoclax in this context, if they are not already captured in clinical trial data on health-related quality of life.\xa0</p><p>5.20.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the majority of AML patients will respond after the first cycle of treatment, but that perhaps an additional 20% will respond after one or more subsequent cycles. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient has not responded following 3 or 4 cycles, they are not likely to respond at all. The Subcommittee therefore considered it appropriate to require renewal/reassessment after 6 months.</p><p>5.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if venetoclax were to be funded in this context, there may be slightly elevated incidence of febrile neutropenia and pneumonia in venetoclax treated patients, but that it is unlikely to result in a significant impact on the health system. The Subcommittee noted that the VIALE A trial included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0-3. The Subcommittee considered that, given that it is expected that the patient’s condition could improve with effective treatment, ECOG performance status would have little bearing on access to treatment if funded. The Subcommittee considered that given the likely lack of effect on access to treatment of an access criteria based on age and ECOG performance status, it was not necessary to include ECOG performance status in the venetoclax or azacitidine eligibility criteria.\xa0</p><p>5.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that venetoclax can cause rapid tumour reduction due to the initiation of apoptosis, and thus poses a risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) at initiation and during the titration phase. Hence, hospital admission maybe required for several days depending on the combination agent used. The Subcommittee noted that CY3PA or P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed to patients with AML, can enhance the action and toxicity of venetoclax, which would require dosage modifications to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that tumour lysis syndrome is relatively uncommon (around 5% of patients, 1.4% of which would be considered serious) and that all patients are recommended to receive allopurinol to further alleviate the risk. The Subcommittee also noted that a small proportion of patients deemed to be at a higher risk of tumour lysis syndrome receive 3mg rasburicase, for the first 1-2 doses of Venetoclax (at most 3 doses).\xa0</p><p>5.23.\tThe Subcommittee considered that currently about 80% of patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy are receiving LoDAC monotherapy and 20% are receiving azacitidine. The Subcommittee considered that based on the current access criteria for azacitidine, it would be reasonable to assume that given the improved efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine, this would increase. The Subcommittee considered that if access were widened to azacitidine, approximately 85% of patients\xa0ineligible for intensive chemotherapy would receive venetoclax in combination with azacitidine.</p><p>5.24.\tThe Subcommittee considered that because azacitidine in combination with venetoclax is significantly more effective than LoDAC in combination with venetoclax, all eligible patients should be prescribed the azacitidine combination where possible, but acknowledging the barriers to azacitidine use in rural communities and the stability advantage of LoDAC after reconstitution. The Subcommittee considered that access issues for treatments like azacitidine have the potential to create inequities in treatment options for rural patients and/or patient with difficulties in attending treatment centres . The Subcommittee considered it important to fund the better outcomes, where possible, like that observed in the VIALE-A trial. The Subcommittee considered that the provision of cancer medicines closer to home for rural patients should be an important consideration for the work being undertaken by Te Aho o Te Kahu (the Cancer Control Agency).\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'fs': '<p>5.4.\tThe Subcommittee noted that acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive heterogeneous haematologic malignancy characterised by the clonal expansion of myeloid precursors (blasts), resulting in their accumulation in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and other tissues including the spleen and liver, and that the underlying pathophysiology in AML consists of a maturational arrest of bone marrow cells in the earliest stages of development.

LoDAC can be self-administered (twice daily) by the patient/caregiver in the community, which minimises the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility. The Subcommittee considered that because of its stability post constitution, it can be more readily administered by patient or carer in the community without regular day ward attendance.</p><p>5.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted that azacitidine is funded for patients with AML, 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia and that LoDAC is open listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule. The Subcommittee considered that azacitidine and LoDAC monotherapies are associated with very poor survival rates in newly diagnosed patients with AML who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy.\xa0</p><p>5.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the burden and manual dexterity needed to give (subcutaneous) azacitidine therapy, in combination with its instability once thawed (which necessitates that it be freshly made for each administration), may not be feasible for some patients, in particular those residing in rural and remote areas with greater limitations on accessing specialist treatment facilities. The Subcommittee noted that this may impact up to 15% of the AML population in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to ensure that all patients eligible for azacitidine would be able to receive it.\xa0</p><p>5.14.\tThe Subcommittee noted the pivotal evidence to support the proposed widening of access to venetoclax in this application from two phase III randomised trials:\xa0</p><p>5.14.1.\t\tDiNardo et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383:617-29 (M15-656 (VIALE-A) trial): a phase III, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of 431 patients with newly diagnosed AML ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy (due to age or comorbidities) who received either venetoclax in combination with azacitidine) (azacitidine 75 mg per square metre of body-surface area subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1 to 7 every 28-day cycle; venetoclax 400 mg orally once daily in 28-day cycles; N=286) or azacitidine with matching placebo (N=145).\xa0</p><p>5.14.2.\tVenetoclax in combination with azacitidine, compared to azacitidine with placebo, resulted in a significantly improved: median overall survival (14.7 months vs 9.6 months, respectively; HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85; P&lt;0.001), composite complete remission rates (66.4% vs. 28.3%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), transfusion independence for both red blood cells (59.8% vs 35.2%, respectively; P&lt;0.001) and platelets (68.5% vs 49.7%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), and median event-free survival (9.8 months vs 7.0 months, respectively; HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001).\xa0</p><p>5.14.3.\tThe venetoclax treated group experienced an increased incidence of notable serious adverse events, notably grade 3, or higher, febrile neutropenia (30% in the venetoclax group vs 10% in the control group) and grade 3, or higher, pneumonia (16% in the venetoclax group vs 22% in the control group), with 1% of patients in the venetoclax group experiencing tumour lysis syndrome. The mortality at 30 days was similar between the two groups (6% in the venetoclax group vs 7% in the control group).\xa0</p><p>5.14.4.\tWei et al. Blood. 2020;135:2137-45 (M16-043 (VIALE-C) trial): a phase III double-blind randomised controlled trial of 211 patients with previously untreated AML who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy who received either venetoclax with LoDAC (venetoclax dosing began at 100 mg on day 1 and increased stepwise over 4 days to reach the target dose of 600 mg; LoDAC 20 mg/m2 subcutaneous injection once daily on days 1 to 10 in all cycles; N=143) or LoDAC with matching placebo (N=68).\xa0</p><p>5.14.5.\tVenetoclax in combination with LoDAC, compared to LoDAC with placebo, resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival (8.4 months vs 4.1 months, respectively; HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; P=0.40), composite complete response rates (47.6% vs 13.2%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), transfusion independence for both red blood cells (41% vs 18%, respectively; P=0.001) and platelets (48% vs 32%, respectively; P=0.40), and median event-free survival (4.7 months vs 2.0 months, respectively; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.82; P=0.002).</p><p>5.14.6.\tThe venetoclax treated group experienced a higher incidence of serious adverse events, such as febrile neutropenia (16% in the venetoclax group vs 18% in the placebo group) and pneumonia (13% in the venetoclax group vs 10% in the placebo group). There were also more serious bleeding events in patients receiving venetoclax (11%) compared to the placebo group (7%). There were 8 instances of tumour lysis syndrome, all in the venetoclax treated group.\xa0</p><p>5.15.\t\tThe Subcommittee considered that the trials were of high strength and good quality and showed the benefit of venetoclax in combination with either azacitidine or LoDAC, compared to azacitidine or LoDAC monotherapy. The Subcommittee however noted that the survival outcomes in the VIALE-A trial were more compelling than those experienced in the VIALE-C trial. The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to widen access to azacitidine to afford the outcomes observed in the VIALE-A trial.</p><p>5.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the VIALE-A and VIALE-C trials included patients with all subtypes of AML (including those with poor cytogenetic risk, secondary AML, and unfavourable blast counts) and indicated a benefit from treatment with venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or LoDAC, even for patients with p53 mutations which usually have a poorer outlook. The Subcommittee considered that the event-free and overall survival outcomes from VIALE-A and VIALE-C would be applicable to the New Zealand population.\xa0</p><p>5.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted the Dombret et al. study in a patient population with AML with &gt;30% blasts which indicated that the overall survival for azacitidine in this patient group was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 12.7 months), and that outcomes with LoDAC are generally worse than with azacitidine (Dombret H, et al. Blood. 2015;126(3):291-9). The Subcommittee noted that the outcomes observed in this patient population were similar to that observed in the control arm of the VIALE-A trial.\xa0</p><p>5.18.\tThe Subcommittee noted that. The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct comparison of venetoclax with azacitidine and venetoclax with LoDAC but considered that because the patient demographics of each trial were similar, comparison of outcomes between the trials would be reasonable. Hence, it was reasonable to deduce that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine was the most effective therapeutic approach for this population and that the lack of azacitidine resulted in inferior outcomes. The Subcommittee considered that the worse outcomes of venetoclax with LoDAC were considered attributable to the relative inefficacy of LoDAC compared to azacitidine.</p><p>5.19.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there are likely to be significant quality-of-life benefits from not being dependent on red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions, and that these benefits should be included in subsequent cost-effectiveness analyses for venetoclax in this context, if they are not already captured in clinical trial data on health-related quality of life.\xa0</p><p>5.20.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the majority of AML patients will respond after the first cycle of treatment, but that perhaps an additional 20% will respond after one or more subsequent cycles. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient has not responded following 3 or 4 cycles, they are not likely to respond at all. The Subcommittee therefore considered it appropriate to require renewal/reassessment after 6 months.</p><p>5.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if venetoclax were to be funded in this context, there may be slightly elevated incidence of febrile neutropenia and pneumonia in venetoclax treated patients, but that it is unlikely to result in a significant impact on the health system. The Subcommittee noted that the VIALE A trial included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0-3. The Subcommittee considered that, given that it is expected that the patient’s condition could improve with effective treatment, ECOG performance status would have little bearing on access to treatment if funded. The Subcommittee considered that given the likely lack of effect on access to treatment of an access criteria based on age and ECOG performance status, it was not necessary to include ECOG performance status in the venetoclax or azacitidine eligibility criteria.\xa0</p><p>5.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that venetoclax can cause rapid tumour reduction due to the initiation of apoptosis, and thus poses a risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) at initiation and during the titration phase. Hence, hospital admission maybe required for several days depending on the combination agent used. The Subcommittee noted that CY3PA or P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed to patients with AML, can enhance the action and toxicity of venetoclax, which would require dosage modifications to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that tumour lysis syndrome is relatively uncommon (around 5% of patients, 1.4% of which would be considered serious) and that all patients are recommended to receive allopurinol to further alleviate the risk. The Subcommittee also noted that a small proportion of patients deemed to be at a higher risk of tumour lysis syndrome receive 3mg rasburicase, for the first 1-2 doses of Venetoclax (at most 3 doses).\xa0</p><p>5.23.\tThe Subcommittee considered that currently about 80% of patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy are receiving LoDAC monotherapy and 20% are receiving azacitidine. The Subcommittee considered that based on the current access criteria for azacitidine, it would be reasonable to assume that given the improved efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine, this would increase. The Subcommittee considered that if access were widened to azacitidine, approximately 85% of patients\xa0ineligible for intensive chemotherapy would receive venetoclax in combination with azacitidine.</p><p>5.24.\tThe Subcommittee considered that because azacitidine in combination with venetoclax is significantly more effective than LoDAC in combination with venetoclax, all eligible patients should be prescribed the azacitidine combination where possible, but acknowledging the barriers to azacitidine use in rural communities and the stability advantage of LoDAC after reconstitution. The Subcommittee considered that access issues for treatments like azacitidine have the potential to create inequities in treatment options for rural patients and/or patient with difficulties in attending treatment centres . The Subcommittee considered it important to fund the better outcomes, where possible, like that observed in the VIALE-A trial. The Subcommittee considered that the provision of cancer medicines closer to home for rural patients should be an important consideration for the work being undertaken by Te Aho o Te Kahu (the Cancer Control Agency).\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted an application from Abbvie for the use of venetoclax (Venclexta) in combination with azacitidine or low dose cytarabine for the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.</p>', 'fs': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted an application from Abbvie for the use of venetoclax (Venclexta) in combination with azacitidine or low dose cytarabine for the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.</p>', 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': 'High', 'fs': 'High', 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cancer Treatments Subcommittee records </a></p>', 'fs': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cancer Treatments Subcommittee records </a></p>', 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Aug 2021', 'fs': 'Aug 2021', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'fs': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000H3pNd2AJ'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000H3pNd2AJ', 'Event_Date__c': '2021-08-03', 'Event_Description__c': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Links__c': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cancer Treatments Subcommittee records </a></p>', 'Outcome__c': 'High', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Aug 2021', 'Published_Recommendation__c': '<p>5.3.\tThe Subcommittee recommended that venetoclax in combination with either azacitidine (based on widened access to azacitidine) or low dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy be listed with a high priority within the context of treatment of malignancy, subject to the following Special Authority criteria applying both to venetoclax and azacitidine (additions in bold, deletions in strikethrough):</p><p>VENETOCLAX</p><p>INITIAL APPLICATION - previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia</p><p>Applications only from a relevant specialist or any other medical practitioner on the recommendation of a relevant specialist.

The Subcommittee noted that the onset of AML is usually rapid, with presentation and diagnosis occurring within weeks of the onset of symptoms (Estey E &amp; Döhner H. Lancet. 2006;368:1894-907)</p><p>5.5.\tThe Subcommittee noted that AML is a relatively rare type of cancer but is the most common type of acute leukaemia diagnosed in New Zealand adults, and accounts for the largest number of deaths from leukaemia in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that the majority of patients present with complications of pancytopenia (low counts for all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and bone marrow failure such as anaemia (e.g. fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches, pale skin, or shortness of breath), thrombocytopenia (e.g. bruising, excess bleeding such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds) and neutropenia (e.g. persistent and recurrent infections often accompanied with fever) or the clinical consequences of leukostasis due to an extremely high white blood cell count (e.g., difficulty breathing, confusion, and decreased consciousness).</p><p>5.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted evidence reporting that Māori have an increased risk of AML (risk ratio 1.5 in the age group 25-49 and risk ratio 1.3 in the age group 50-74), relative to New Zealand Caucasians (Tracey &amp; Carter. Am J Haematol. 2005;79:114-8). The Subcommittee also noted that a recent study reported that Māori and Pacific people appeared to present with AML at a younger age than individuals of European descent (Chan et al. Blood. 2020;136:36-37. Abstract only) and that individuals of European descent were significantly older at diagnosis compared to other ethnicities (median of 70 years vs. 51 for Māori and 56 for Pacific peoples, and 58 for all other ethnicities, p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the age of a patient at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival. Despite AML presenting at a younger age in Māori people, the higher incidence of comorbidities in the Māori population would result in Māori having a higher likelihood of being ineligible for intensive chemotherapy after diagnosis.\xa0</p><p>5.7.\tThe Subcommittee noted that Chan et al. also reported that AML appears to disproportionately affect those who live in more socio-economically deprived areas (NZDep2013), with 23% of cases reported in the most deprived 20% of the population, compared with 16% of the cases in the least deprived 20%, and that socio-economic deprivation was also an adverse prognostic factor.\xa0</p><p>5.8.\tThe Subcommittee considered that patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy constitutes approximately 50% of newly diagnosed AML patients (approximately 60 - 70 patients per year).

The Subcommittee therefore considered it appropriate to require renewal/reassessment after 6 months.</p><p>5.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if venetoclax were to be funded in this context, there may be slightly elevated incidence of febrile neutropenia and pneumonia in venetoclax treated patients, but that it is unlikely to result in a significant impact on the health system. The Subcommittee noted that the VIALE A trial included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0-3. The Subcommittee considered that, given that it is expected that the patient’s condition could improve with effective treatment, ECOG performance status would have little bearing on access to treatment if funded. The Subcommittee considered that given the likely lack of effect on access to treatment of an access criteria based on age and ECOG performance status, it was not necessary to include ECOG performance status in the venetoclax or azacitidine eligibility criteria.\xa0</p><p>5.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that venetoclax can cause rapid tumour reduction due to the initiation of apoptosis, and thus poses a risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) at initiation and during the titration phase. Hence, hospital admission maybe required for several days depending on the combination agent used. The Subcommittee noted that CY3PA or P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed to patients with AML, can enhance the action and toxicity of venetoclax, which would require dosage modifications to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that tumour lysis syndrome is relatively uncommon (around 5% of patients, 1.4% of which would be considered serious) and that all patients are recommended to receive allopurinol to further alleviate the risk. The Subcommittee also noted that a small proportion of patients deemed to be at a higher risk of tumour lysis syndrome receive 3mg rasburicase, for the first 1-2 doses of Venetoclax (at most 3 doses).\xa0</p><p>5.23.\tThe Subcommittee considered that currently about 80% of patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy are receiving LoDAC monotherapy and 20% are receiving azacitidine. The Subcommittee considered that based on the current access criteria for azacitidine, it would be reasonable to assume that given the improved efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine, this would increase. The Subcommittee considered that if access were widened to azacitidine, approximately 85% of patients\xa0ineligible for intensive chemotherapy would receive venetoclax in combination with azacitidine.</p><p>5.24.\tThe Subcommittee considered that because azacitidine in combination with venetoclax is significantly more effective than LoDAC in combination with venetoclax, all eligible patients should be prescribed the azacitidine combination where possible, but acknowledging the barriers to azacitidine use in rural communities and the stability advantage of LoDAC after reconstitution. The Subcommittee considered that access issues for treatments like azacitidine have the potential to create inequities in treatment options for rural patients and/or patient with difficulties in attending treatment centres . The Subcommittee considered it important to fund the better outcomes, where possible, like that observed in the VIALE-A trial. The Subcommittee considered that the provision of cancer medicines closer to home for rural patients should be an important consideration for the work being undertaken by Te Aho o Te Kahu (the Cancer Control Agency).\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000D4JsQAK'}, 'change': None}]",Apr 2021,False,True
