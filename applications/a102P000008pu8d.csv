The Committee considered that it was suitable for use with other haematological malignancy indications eg APML or HLH as they are also considered to be at high-risk of IFI. The Committee also considered that it was suitable to fund posaconazole for treatment of IFI for those that would be eligible for funded voriconazole treatment but where the fungal pathogen was resistant to voriconazole or where voriconazole is contraindicated. The Committee noted that currently there are only intravenous therapies (liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin) funded in these instances.\xa0The Committee noted several approved NPPAs (Named Patient Pharmaceutical Application) for posaconazole use in these situations and considered that the restrictions could be extended to allow use of voriconazole and posaconazole for the rare circumstances where immunocompetent people have an invasive fungal infection.</p><p>18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that voriconazole use in the haematology setting for the prophylaxis of IFI would only occur in children.

The Committee noted that comorbidities that pre-dispose people to IFI also could impact the estimated mortality rate.</p><p>5. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that recommendations for prophylaxis are governed by risk of IFI. The Committee noted that this is stratified by risk of infection where low risk is considered &lt;5% IFI risk and high risk is considered &gt;10% IFI risk. The Committee noted that those with a risk of IFI&gt;10% were recommended anti-mould prophylaxis.</p><p>6. The Committee considered that there are few funded agents for anti-mould prophylaxis for IFI. The Committee considered that this was a severe health condition (IFI) with significant unmet health need. The Committee also considered that this was different to the prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis (yeast) for which fluconazole capsules were available without restriction. The Committee considered that there was value in having amphotericin B liposomal injection and caspofungin injection available under hospital restriction for prophylaxis of IFI where the use of azole antifungals is not appropriate. The Committee considered these groups to be those receiving vincristine in their treatment regimen, with significant mucositis, liver dysfunction, or post-surgery for liver or lung transplant as well as where cancer treatment protocols note drug interactions with azole antifungals.</p><p>7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed criteria for voriconazole and posaconazole were appropriate with an additional criterion restricting concurrent azole use. The Committee noted that amphotericin B liposomal and caspofungin injections were available for treatment of IFI, with minimal restriction, on the recommendation of an infectious disease specialist.</p><p>8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered the significant health need of children with ALL at risk of IFI and noted there were no funded treatments for prophylaxis. The Committee considered this an unmet health need for children with ALL and those unable to swallow tablets due to the poor pharmacokinetic profile of the posaconazole liquid formulation, the need for it to be taken with a fatty meal to aid absorption and the difficulty reaching an adequate concentration before saturation of enteral absorption pathways.</p><p>9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the following would be included in the group of conditions with a high risk (&gt;10%) of IFI : allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), AML or ALL induction, other haematologic malignancies with prolonged neutropenia (3-5 weeks) e.g. acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) or aplastic anaemia, GVHD on high dose corticosteroids (equivalent to 1 mg/kg prednisone) with neutropenia for over 1 week. The Committee considered these conditions to be high risk as per international guidelines (Australasian, US and European and Children’s Oncology Group (COG) of which Starship Children’s Hospital is a member). Other people identified with an unmet health need were those who had received lung and liver transplants. The Committee considered that, of the groups considered for funding, aspergillus infection in people with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplant and those undergoing high risk liver transplant or repeat transplant places them especially at risk of IFI.\xa0</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Health Benefit</em></h3><p>10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the evidence for use of voriconazole and posaconazole in those who are immunocompromised is supported by international guidelines. The Committee considered that the body of evidence supporting these guidelines was significant and explicit. The Committee considered prophylaxis of IFI with voriconazole or posaconazole was the international standard. The Committee noted that three network meta-analyses found that there were no significant differences in efficacy of the oral forms of voriconazole and posaconazole (tablet only) but itraconazole was not considered equivalent due to its unreliable absorption.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105838/"" target=""_blank"">Lee CH, Lin C, Ho CL, Lin JC.

The Committee considered evidence for alternative options was less robust however guidelines supported caspofungin and in some instances liposomal amphotericin B.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Suitability</em></h3><p>14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Group considered the impact of CYP2C19 on the metabolism of voriconazole and the need for therapeutic blood concentration monitoring in people taking voriconazole. The Committee noted that this was already in place for other indications. The Committee considered that variability of CYP2C19 phenotypes meant that there is up to 100-fold patient variability with voriconazole concentrations and clearance. The Committee considered the association of ethnicity and CYP2C19 phenotype and the potential for increased risk of toxicity in ethnicities who are more likely to be poor metaboliser phenotypes if not appropriately monitored. The Committee considered that although posaconazole has less interpatient variability therapeutic drug monitoring was still required.</p><p>15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that voriconazole is given twice daily in oral liquid, tablet and intravenous forms. The Committee considered the availability of these three formulations to be advantageous for community and hospital administration.</p><p>16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>Posaconazole modified-release tablets are given once daily. The Group considered the oral posaconazole liquid to be unsuitable for use due to the requirement for high fat intake (15-50 g) with every dose. The Committee considered that this was not only unpalatable but particularly challenging in those with cancer where the majority of people have reduced appetite, mucositis or are on intravenous nutrition. The Committee considered that delisting the posaconazole oral liquid, after the listing of modified-release tablets, was appropriate due to the low use of the liquid, and concern with non-equivalent formulation selection error. The Committee noted that the intravenous formulation of posaconazole is not Medsafe registered in New Zealand and is not funded for use.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Cost and Savings </em></h3><p>17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee estimated that in people with ALL, three to four people a year would benefit from posaconazole for IFI and for those with aplastic anaemia, five to six people a year would benefit from posaconazole prophylaxis for IFI. The Committee considered that posaconazole would be used less in children. The Committee considered that it was suitable for use with other haematological malignancy indications eg APML or HLH as they are also considered to be at high-risk of IFI. The Committee also considered that it was suitable to fund posaconazole for treatment of IFI for those that would be eligible for funded voriconazole treatment but where the fungal pathogen was resistant to voriconazole or where voriconazole is contraindicated. The Committee noted that currently there are only intravenous therapies (liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin) funded in these instances.\xa0The Committee noted several approved NPPAs (Named Patient Pharmaceutical Application) for posaconazole use in these situations and considered that the restrictions could be extended to allow use of voriconazole and posaconazole for the rare circumstances where immunocompetent people have an invasive fungal infection.</p><p>18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that voriconazole use in the haematology setting for the prophylaxis of IFI would only occur in children. The Committee estimated the paediatric aplastic anaemia group to be five children per year and the high-risk ALL group to be 20 children per year within the Starship Children’s Hospital service. The Committee considered that voriconazole would not be used in combination with other antifungals for the prophylaxis of IFI. The Committee considered that voriconazole would displace the majority of the use of amphotericin B in children as it is the preferred treatment except in children pre or post vincristine chemotherapy. The Committee considered that voriconazole prophylaxis for IFI would not be used in adult haematology patients unless they were unable to take posaconazole modified-release tablets.</p><p>19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the additional costs for the health sector to include cost for therapeutic blood monitoring whilst on treatment due to significant interpatient variability in metabolism by CYP2C19. The Committee also considered that pharmacogenomic testing could be used to assess CYP2C19 phenotype prior to prescription of voriconazole. The Committee noted that this is not used regularly within New Zealand and therapeutic blood monitoring is currently used to titrate the dose appropriately. The Committee considered neutrophil recovery following chemotherapy to take four weeks, however some indications would have a shorter period to neutrophil recovery.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Funding Criteria </em></h3><p>20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the prescriber restriction within the criteria to be appropriate and considered that within a hospital setting that it was likely to be prescribed on the recommendation of a haematologist, transplant physician or infectious disease physician for those treated with high dose induction therapy or re-induction therapy for haematological malignancies, stem cell or solid organ transplant or aplastic anaemia.</p><p>21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that neutrophil recovery would take four weeks and that a 6-week reassessment would be appropriate after the initial application.</p><p>22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the high-risk IFI group should be clearly identified in the funding criteria as those with a risk of &gt;10% as described guidelines endorsed by Te Whatu Ora hospitals. The Committee considered that the specified conditions included in the criteria were all considered to have a risk &gt;10% with the inclusion of those with ALL, aplastic anaemia and other haematological malignancy eg APML, HLH and lung or liver transplant at high risk for aspergillus infection.</p><p>23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Group considered that those with ALL, AML, aplastic anaemia, and other haematological malignancies were considered at a risk of &gt;10% of IFI if they were being treated with high-dose remission induction therapy or re-introduction therapy or other chemotherapy expected to have a prolonged phase of neutropenia.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Summary of Assessment</em></h3><p>24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for voriconazole if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the<em> </em>prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in those being treated for high-risk malignancies, lung or liver transplant recipients.
