The Subcommittee considered that actual uptake of these biologics is only about 2% of patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma despite all other options due to patient preference for inhaled over biological therapy as well as the logistical complexity of biological therapy. The Subcommittee noted that mepolizumab and omalizumab are given as an injection and require admission to a day stay unit (at a cost of $500 per admission) for at least the first few treatments; subsequent doses of omalizumab may be given in the community via prefilled syringes, and mepolizumab is expected to be able to be delivered in the community after Medsafe approval in 2021.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Special Authority criteria for mepolizumab and omalizumab each require a patient to have trialled high-dose oral corticosteroids (1000 mcg per day or equivalent) with a long-acting beta agonist (LABA); current funded options are such that this high dose of steroid cannot be achieved without using two separate devices.

The Subcommittee noted that FF/VI 200/25 (Breo Ellipta 200) would be taken as one inhaled dose daily and had been proposed to enable patients to receive the high ICS dose without receiving excess LABA, as would occur with two puffs of a 100/25 inhaler.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the FF/VI 200/25 has the same (or similar) therapeutic effect as other inhaled corticosteroids (i.e. a combination of an inhaler providing ICS/LABA and an additional inhaler with the same ICS e.g. fluticasone propionate or budesonide) that are currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule, however, the FF/VI 200/25 provides this dose in one inhaler only.

The Subcommittee considered that the requirement for access to be provided in consultation with a paediatrician or respiratory physician was to ensure that the risks associated with FF/VI 200/25 would be minimised and access be provided to only those patients with sufficient need to warrant the use of the high dose of FF.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that an inhaled corticosteroid dose equivalent to at least 500 mcg per day of fluticasone propionate was more appropriate as a requirement for access than a dose equivalent to 1000 mcg per day.

The Subcommittee considered that FF/VI 200/25 could reduce medicine costs (e.g. salbutamol and oral corticosteroids).

The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee had previously commented that funding a combination inhaler such as high dose fluticasone with vilanterol (200/25) would improve adherence in those with severe asthma, whereas PTAC had previously noted evidence that showed this did not impact adherence. The Committee considered that its review of applications has an increased emphasis on equity, and that this may be based on clinical assumptions (particularly where there is not readily available, high-quality evidence). The Committee considered that Māori and Pacific peoples are disproportionately affected by asthma with increased hospitalisation rates, compared with non-Māori, non-Pacific peoples. The Committee considered that Māori also have reduced access to health services and opportunities to improve health literacy and are also more likely to live in areas of greater socioeconomic disadvantage than non-Māori, non-Pacific peoples. The Committee considered that this suggests that the availability of a single, combination inhaler therapy to treat severe asthma may provide potential health benefits to Māori and Pacific peoples.
