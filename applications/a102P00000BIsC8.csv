The Subcommittee considered that on this basis there would be approximately 130 patients who would relapse post-transplant each year; that there would be approximately 150 patients who would relapse after first line treatment if ineligible for transplant each year; and there would be approximately 170 patients who would require treatment in the third line setting each year.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of cycles received will depend on PFS which is influenced by prior lines of therapy and the proportion of patients whose disease was refractory, therefore the treatment cost per cycle would be most useful for cost-effectiveness assessment, as opposed to cost per treatment, given the variable extent of pre-treatment in the clinical trials.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for second-line treatment, comparators could be bortezomib retreatment as CyBorD/BTD, or MPT and CTD.

The Subcommittee considered the most appropriate comparator for use in the second-line would be BTD, unless the patient could not tolerate bortezomib, in which case regimens without bortezomib would be used. The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of thalidomide in this setting is limited by the development of neuropathy, and efficacy difficult to establish from the scientific evidence base as most studies use more novel agents at relapse.

The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for carfilzomib once-weekly and twice-weekly dosing was of good strength and quality. Overall, the Subcommittee considered this evidence suggests carfilzomib once weekly would provide benefits in the second-line and in the third-line setting, and that the evidence from ENDEAVOR and ASPIRE suggests the benefit would be across all subgroups with relapsed/refractory MM (although there would be smaller benefit in lenalidomide-refractory disease).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the higher carfilzomib doses given once weekly were equivalent to dosing of 70 mg/m2 and 112 mg/m2 per week and that these regimens are used in some jurisdictions (registered in USA and Switzerland; being considered by TGA and Canada). The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to infer that efficacy is probably similar between these two dosing regimens and that risks may be similar, although weekly treatment may be slightly better tolerated.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded as a second-line or third-line treatment, carfilzomib and dexamethasone could be administered either according to the ENDEAVOR trial dosing (56 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> twice weekly) or the ARROW trial dosing (70 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> once weekly) until disease progression. The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2019</a> CaTSoP had thought that the uptake of 70 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> once weekly would be low, given uncertainty of benefit. The Subcommittee considered that the updated publication with evidence of impact from once-weekly dosing, along with the submission from the NZMIG indicating that this dosing regimen would be preferred by New Zealand clinicians, suggests that once-weekly may be preferred due to its lesser impact on infusion resources. The Subcommittee considered that the higher weekly dosing may be used in patients who find the twice-weekly treatment challenging eg due to travel requirements and infusion burden.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that the outcomes observed with twice-weekly carfilzomib in the ENDEAVOR trial would be similar if these patients had received the once-weekly dosing regimen used in the ARROW trial.

However, the Subcommittee considered this estimate was likely too high for second- or third-line patients, as transplant eligibility decreases over time given the age of patients at initial diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that in time, the funded use of lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting would be indicative of the proportion of patients who are ineligible for transplant in third-line setting. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 400 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year and considered that approximately 50% would initially be eligible for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that on this basis there would be approximately 130 patients who would relapse post-transplant each year; that there would be approximately 150 patients who would relapse after first line treatment if ineligible for transplant each year; and there would be approximately 170 patients who would require treatment in the third line setting each year.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of cycles received will depend on PFS which is influenced by prior lines of therapy and the proportion of patients whose disease was refractory, therefore the treatment cost per cycle would be most useful for cost-effectiveness assessment, as opposed to cost per treatment, given the variable extent of pre-treatment in the clinical trials.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for second-line treatment, comparators could be bortezomib retreatment as CyBorD/BTD, or MPT and CTD. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of interest in this setting was improved PFS (above that gained from bortezomib retreatment). The Subcommittee considered the most appropriate comparator for use in the second-line would be BTD, unless the patient could not tolerate bortezomib, in which case regimens without bortezomib would be used. The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of thalidomide in this setting is limited by the development of neuropathy, and efficacy difficult to establish from the scientific evidence base as most studies use more novel agents at relapse. The Subcommittee considered that outcomes would be expected to be worse without bortezomib.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for third-line treatment, standard therapy is lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib, although patients who had a prior autologous stem cell transplant with lenalidomide maintenance could be considered for third-line treatment with a bortezomib and/or thalidomide-based regimen.
