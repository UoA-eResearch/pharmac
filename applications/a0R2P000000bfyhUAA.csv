The correspondence noted that studies show that half of gay and bisexual men in New Zealand are not open with their clinicians, and that 34% of men who have sex with men who would like to use PrEP stated that discussing the issue with their General Practitioner was a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>5.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the laboratory testing criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP, the Subcommittee considered that the requirement for recent results, particularly HIV serology, to be known at the time of prescribing is important to ensure appropriate treatment and management (e.g. if HIV positivity is reported, provisions would be made to protect the person and community), and considered that the funding criteria should not be amended in this regard at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP including invasive questions about sexual practices and drug use that may present a barrier to access, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the questions were confronting and that many people would not want to answer them. The Subcommittee noted that the criteria were based on international guidelines intended to indicate whether sexualised drug use (“chem sex”) was likely to occur, as this would target treatment to a patient group who are at risk of contracting HIV. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to amend the question regarding methamphetamine use in the criteria.</p><p><br></p><p>5.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the timeframe for recent STI in the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be widened to one year to allow for changes in sexual habits as a result of the recent COVID-19 lockdown and to ensure that potential concerns about disclosing lockdown non-adherence would not prevent access to treatment. The Subcommittee noted that this timeframe would align with the Scottish guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p>5.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, if access to TD/FTC for PrEP were to be signifcantly widened (e.g. through removal of all at-risk criteria under point 6) it would require substantial and timely health system support including much greater GP involvement in providing PrEP prescriptions than has occurred to date. The Subcommittee considered that such widened criteria would result in a considerable increase in the current estimate of eligible people (i.e. approximately 18% or 5800) of higher-risk HIV negative MSM, becoming potentially eligible for TD/FTC for PrEP. Overall, the Subcommittee did not support significantly widening access to TD/FTC for PrEP in this way at this time but considered that this could be reconsidered in future.</p><p><br></p><p>5.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the prescriber types for the current Special Authority for TD/FTC for PrEP were appropriate and did not require amendment.</p><p><br></p><p>5.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be amended as follows (additions shown in <b>bold</b>, deletions shown in <strike>strikethrough</strike>):</p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Special Authority for Subsidy </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Initial application</b><span style=""font-size: 9pt;""> from any relevant practitioner.

The Subcommittee suggested changes to the current access criteria wording, and also noted the views of the CSWG including the following:</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The current criteria may disincentivise condom use, potentially encouraging the spread of other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. syphilis); and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Noting the increased prevalence of STIs nationally, and particularly among men who have sex with men, condom use should be encouraged and amending the criteria to align with the Australasian Society of Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM) guidelines for PrEP would do this.</p><p><br></p><p>5.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received an application from Body Positive Inc. to broaden the prescriber access for TD/FTC for PrEP, to include an evidence-based dosing regimen for TD/FTC for PrEP and to remove the access criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP altogether as they consider that current access depends on patient being willing to disclose their sexual behaviour and methamphetamine use to the GPs.</p><p><br></p><p>5.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received correspondence from a General Practitioner who considered that the criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be reviewed because the criteria included invasive questions that are associated with a lot of stigma and which present barriers to men accessing the treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>5.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received correspondence from the New Zealand AIDS Foundation (NZAF) and Family Planning New Zealand (FPNZ) as part of the consultation process for the proposal relating to Schedule changes made in response to COVID-19, and that this correspondence requested PHARMAC to review the current criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP due to the following views of the NZAF and FPNZ:</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>For patients with no recent test results for HIV, STI and renal function, PrEP should be prescribed on the same day as laboratory tests are ordered, with patients advised to only fill their prescription once informed it is safe to do so; and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>An undiagnosed bacterial STI does not constitute a contraindication to PrEP use; such cases could be followed up after treatment is initiated; and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Barriers to accessing PrEP include cost, time, and the necessity to discuss intimate details of sexual practices with clinicians. The correspondence noted that studies show that half of gay and bisexual men in New Zealand are not open with their clinicians, and that 34% of men who have sex with men who would like to use PrEP stated that discussing the issue with their General Practitioner was a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>5.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the laboratory testing criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP, the Subcommittee considered that the requirement for recent results, particularly HIV serology, to be known at the time of prescribing is important to ensure appropriate treatment and management (e.g. if HIV positivity is reported, provisions would be made to protect the person and community), and considered that the funding criteria should not be amended in this regard at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP including invasive questions about sexual practices and drug use that may present a barrier to access, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the questions were confronting and that many people would not want to answer them. The Subcommittee noted that the criteria were based on international guidelines intended to indicate whether sexualised drug use (“chem sex”) was likely to occur, as this would target treatment to a patient group who are at risk of contracting HIV. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to amend the question regarding methamphetamine use in the criteria.</p><p><br></p><p>5.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the timeframe for recent STI in the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be widened to one year to allow for changes in sexual habits as a result of the recent COVID-19 lockdown and to ensure that potential concerns about disclosing lockdown non-adherence would not prevent access to treatment. The Subcommittee noted that this timeframe would align with the Scottish guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p>5.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, if access to TD/FTC for PrEP were to be signifcantly widened (e.g. through removal of all at-risk criteria under point 6) it would require substantial and timely health system support including much greater GP involvement in providing PrEP prescriptions than has occurred to date. The Subcommittee considered that such widened criteria would result in a considerable increase in the current estimate of eligible people (i.e. approximately 18% or 5800) of higher-risk HIV negative MSM, becoming potentially eligible for TD/FTC for PrEP. Overall, the Subcommittee did not support significantly widening access to TD/FTC for PrEP in this way at this time but considered that this could be reconsidered in future.</p><p><br></p><p>5.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the prescriber types for the current Special Authority for TD/FTC for PrEP were appropriate and did not require amendment.</p><p><br></p><p>5.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be amended as follows (additions shown in <b>bold</b>, deletions shown in <strike>strikethrough</strike>):</p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Special Authority for Subsidy </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Initial application</b><span style=""font-size: 9pt;""> from any relevant practitioner.

The Subcommittee suggested changes to the current access criteria wording, and also noted the views of the CSWG including the following:</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The current criteria may disincentivise condom use, potentially encouraging the spread of other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. syphilis); and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Noting the increased prevalence of STIs nationally, and particularly among men who have sex with men, condom use should be encouraged and amending the criteria to align with the Australasian Society of Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM) guidelines for PrEP would do this.</p><p><br></p><p>5.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received an application from Body Positive Inc. to broaden the prescriber access for TD/FTC for PrEP, to include an evidence-based dosing regimen for TD/FTC for PrEP and to remove the access criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP altogether as they consider that current access depends on patient being willing to disclose their sexual behaviour and methamphetamine use to the GPs.</p><p><br></p><p>5.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received correspondence from a General Practitioner who considered that the criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be reviewed because the criteria included invasive questions that are associated with a lot of stigma and which present barriers to men accessing the treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>5.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received correspondence from the New Zealand AIDS Foundation (NZAF) and Family Planning New Zealand (FPNZ) as part of the consultation process for the proposal relating to Schedule changes made in response to COVID-19, and that this correspondence requested PHARMAC to review the current criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP due to the following views of the NZAF and FPNZ:</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>For patients with no recent test results for HIV, STI and renal function, PrEP should be prescribed on the same day as laboratory tests are ordered, with patients advised to only fill their prescription once informed it is safe to do so; and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>An undiagnosed bacterial STI does not constitute a contraindication to PrEP use; such cases could be followed up after treatment is initiated; and</p><p><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Barriers to accessing PrEP include cost, time, and the necessity to discuss intimate details of sexual practices with clinicians. The correspondence noted that studies show that half of gay and bisexual men in New Zealand are not open with their clinicians, and that 34% of men who have sex with men who would like to use PrEP stated that discussing the issue with their General Practitioner was a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>5.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the laboratory testing criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP, the Subcommittee considered that the requirement for recent results, particularly HIV serology, to be known at the time of prescribing is important to ensure appropriate treatment and management (e.g. if HIV positivity is reported, provisions would be made to protect the person and community), and considered that the funding criteria should not be amended in this regard at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regard to the criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP including invasive questions about sexual practices and drug use that may present a barrier to access, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the questions were confronting and that many people would not want to answer them. The Subcommittee noted that the criteria were based on international guidelines intended to indicate whether sexualised drug use (“chem sex”) was likely to occur, as this would target treatment to a patient group who are at risk of contracting HIV. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to amend the question regarding methamphetamine use in the criteria.</p><p><br></p><p>5.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the timeframe for recent STI in the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be widened to one year to allow for changes in sexual habits as a result of the recent COVID-19 lockdown and to ensure that potential concerns about disclosing lockdown non-adherence would not prevent access to treatment. The Subcommittee noted that this timeframe would align with the Scottish guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p>5.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, if access to TD/FTC for PrEP were to be signifcantly widened (e.g. through removal of all at-risk criteria under point 6) it would require substantial and timely health system support including much greater GP involvement in providing PrEP prescriptions than has occurred to date. The Subcommittee considered that such widened criteria would result in a considerable increase in the current estimate of eligible people (i.e. approximately 18% or 5800) of higher-risk HIV negative MSM, becoming potentially eligible for TD/FTC for PrEP. Overall, the Subcommittee did not support significantly widening access to TD/FTC for PrEP in this way at this time but considered that this could be reconsidered in future.</p><p><br></p><p>5.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the prescriber types for the current Special Authority for TD/FTC for PrEP were appropriate and did not require amendment.</p><p><br></p><p>5.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for TD/FTC for PrEP should be amended as follows (additions shown in <b>bold</b>, deletions shown in <strike>strikethrough</strike>):</p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Special Authority for Subsidy </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Initial application</b><span style=""font-size: 9pt;""> from any relevant practitioner.
