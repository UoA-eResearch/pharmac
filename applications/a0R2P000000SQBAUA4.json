Members considered it could also be due to more confidence in other agents, such as flecainide, and concerns around amiodarone\u2019s toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee discussed agents in this class which have little use. Members considered that antiarrhythmics in general did not have good efficacy but there were few alternatives for difficult to treat arrythmias. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that mexiletine was used by specialists for difficult to treat arrythmias, such as long QT syndrome and some ventricular tachycardias.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that disopyramide and propafenone have niche roles such as treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the Subcommittee also noted that none of its members had personal expertise with this area.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that likely alternatives to mexiletine, disopyramide and propafenone could include prolonged hospital admissions and VT ablation for some patients.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the recent decision to change the funded brands of flecainide. It considered that the consultation on this was good and that the outcome would mean substantial savings. The Subcommittee considered that plasma monitoring could be considered for children. The Subcommittee also considered that patients on flecainide are mainly supported by a GPs and considered that years could go for years without a patient seeing a cardiologist, and that even then they would often be seen by a cardiology nurse instead. Members considered there were marked differences in treatment practice and knowledge around the country. Members considered that ensuring GPs are well informed about the brand change was important.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee discussed ivabradine, which it had previously recommended funding for inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) with a high priority. The Subcommittee also noted that PTAC had recommended that it review ivabradine once its registration had been approved. The Subcommittee also noted that no ivabradine product was registered and that there no applications to Medsafe for registration have been made.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that since there is a small market for ivabradine, there was little incentive for a supplier to pay the costs of registration. Members considered that because the market was small, the risk from using an unregistered medicine was also small. Members also considered that there remains a high unmet health need for patients with IST intolerant to funded agents, and that ivabradine would provide a health benefit for this niche group of patients.
