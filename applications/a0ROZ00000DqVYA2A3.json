Previous guidelines were accessed. Five studies were considered within the guidelines and the assessment of evidence for the treatment of restless legs syndrome including non-ergot dopamine agonists. Rotigotine patches (1-3 mg/24 h) were considered effective for short and long-term treatment of primary RLS while ropinirole (2-3 mg daily) and pramipexole (0.25-0.75 mg daily) were considered effective for short-term treatment and possibly effective for long-term treatment. In particular, a 5-year prospective study reported that the overall 5-year incidence of clinically signi\ufb01cant augmentation was 13.2%. Augmentation was dose dependent, 5.1% of patients experienced this at 1\u20133 mg/24 h, whilst 8.1% were receiving 4 mg/24 h.

The authors concluded that transdermal rotigotine is efficacious at doses of 2-3 mg (previously considered likely efficacious). It was reported that there is insufficient evidence for the 1 mg dose of rotigotine, and 0.5 mg dose of rotigotine is not efficacious. Long-term trials with rotigotine need to be undertaken to monitor local site reactions and augmentation, and dose and treatment duration dependence need to be taken into consideration. Further study is needed exploring the biological mechanism of augmentation and possible methods to reduce the risk and severity of its occurrence. Other agents assessed included gabapentinoids, opioids, iron, bupropion, clonidine, vitamin C and E and non-pharmacological interventions.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following evidence in this application:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20813583/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Oertel et al.

Rotigotine patches (1-3 mg/24 h) were considered effective for short and long-term treatment of primary RLS while ropinirole (2-3 mg daily) and pramipexole (0.25-0.75 mg daily) were considered effective for short-term treatment and possibly effective for long-term treatment. In particular, a 5-year prospective study reported that the overall 5-year incidence of clinically signi\ufb01cant augmentation was 13.2%. Augmentation was dose dependent, 5.1% of patients experienced this at 1\u20133 mg/24 h, whilst 8.1% were receiving 4 mg/24 h.

It was reported that there is insufficient evidence for the 1 mg dose of rotigotine, and 0.5 mg dose of rotigotine is not efficacious. Long-term trials with rotigotine need to be undertaken to monitor local site reactions and augmentation, and dose and treatment duration dependence need to be taken into consideration. Further study is needed exploring the biological mechanism of augmentation and possible methods to reduce the risk and severity of its occurrence.

The Committee considered that there was a lack of evidence of the prevalence of RLS in M\u0101ori compared to people of other ethnicities in New Zealand.

The Committee considered that this prevalence was a potential overestimation due to the impact and variability of physician judgement in diagnosis and treatment of RLS. The Committee considered that the reported prevalence rates of RLS among the epidemiological literature were highly variable and the evidence was generally of low quality. The Committee considered that those who want pharmacological treatment for RLS it was possible that this comprised a very large group of people.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was a lack of evidence around the prevalence of RLS in M\u0101ori or Pacific peoples compared to people of other ethnicities in New Zealand.

The Committee considered that funded options for pharmacotherapy include gabapentin, pregabalin as first line options and non-ergot dopamine agonists or levodopa agents as second line treatments. The Committee considered that if funded, rotigotine would likely be a second line treatment option in addition to the currently available non-ergot dopamine agonists (ropinirole or pramipexole).</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that non-ergot dopamine agonists or levodopa agents are typically used second line due to concerns about augmentation and an increased risk of worsening movement disorders with use of dopaminergic treatments compared to gabapentinoids.

Mean treatment difference in IRLS sum score compared to placebo at the end of the maintenance phase as follows (p&lt;0\u00b70001): \u20135\u00b73 (95% CI, \u20137\u00b76 to \u20132\u00b79) in those who actually received 1 mg, \u20137.7 (95% CI, \u201310\u00b73 to \u20135\u00b70) in those who actually received 2 mg group, and \u20138.0 (95% CI, \u201310\u00b77 to \u20135\u00b74) in those who actually received 3 mg group. Treatment difference in CGI item 1 score was also recorded. Skin reactions, mostly mild or moderate, were seen in 43% of those who received rotigotine and 2% of those who received placebo, none of which required hospitalisation. Ten patients had a serious adverse event that was related to rotigotine.

Previous guidelines were accessed. Five studies were considered within the guidelines and the assessment of evidence for the treatment of restless legs syndrome including non-ergot dopamine agonists. Rotigotine patches (1-3 mg/24 h) were considered effective for short and long-term treatment of primary RLS while ropinirole (2-3 mg daily) and pramipexole (0.25-0.75 mg daily) were considered effective for short-term treatment and possibly effective for long-term treatment. In particular, a 5-year prospective study reported that the overall 5-year incidence of clinically signi\ufb01cant augmentation was 13.2%. Augmentation was dose dependent, 5.1% of patients experienced this at 1\u20133 mg/24 h, whilst 8.1% were receiving 4 mg/24 h. Rotigotine (and other funded non-ergot dopamine agonists) was considered effective and recommended for short- and long-term use for RLS.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756335/\" target=\"_blank\">Winkelmann et al.

The authors concluded that transdermal rotigotine is efficacious at doses of 2-3 mg (previously considered likely efficacious). It was reported that there is insufficient evidence for the 1 mg dose of rotigotine, and 0.5 mg dose of rotigotine is not efficacious. Long-term trials with rotigotine need to be undertaken to monitor local site reactions and augmentation, and dose and treatment duration dependence need to be taken into consideration. Further study is needed exploring the biological mechanism of augmentation and possible methods to reduce the risk and severity of its occurrence. Other agents assessed included gabapentinoids, opioids, iron, bupropion, clonidine, vitamin C and E and non-pharmacological interventions.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following evidence in this application:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20813583/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Oertel et al.
