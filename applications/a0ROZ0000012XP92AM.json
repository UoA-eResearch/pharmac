Clin Infect Dis. 2018;66:163-171). The Subcommittee noted that the adjusted all-cause hospital mortality at 30 days after starting treatments was 9% with ceftazidime and avibactam compared to 32% with colistin (P = 0.001), and there was an adjusted probability of a better outcome of 64% (95% CI: 57% to 71%) with ceftazidime and avibactam. The Subcommittee considered the results of this study show that there is a greater reduction in mortality with ceftazidime with avibactam compared to colistin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence for ceftazidime and avibactam:</p><p>\u2022\tAlatoom et al. Int J Infect Dis. 2017;62:39-43.</p><p>\u2022\tKing et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017;61:e00449-17.</p><p>\u2022\tKrapp et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2017;770-773.</p><p>\u2022\tSader et al. Antimicrob Agent Chemother. 2017;61:e01045-17.</p><p>\u2022\tShields et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2016. 63:1615-8.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the results of the in vitro published by Alatoom et al. and Sader et al. report susceptibility of Ps. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and avibactam of 94% (29 of 31) and 97% respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence was unable to confirm whether patients with cystic fibrosis who have infection due to Ps. aeruginosa would benefit from treatment with ceftazidime and avibactam.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that ceftazidime with avibactam should be used with aztreonam and considered that this combination treatment would address the current health need in salvage therapies for the treatment of MDROs, and specifically those infections due to CRE. Members considered that ceftazidime with avibactam should reduce the need for new agents against Ps. aeruginosa, however, some strains may still require alternative agents and this small number of cases could be managed through the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) process. The Subcommittee considered that this therapeutic approach would appropriately manage the risk of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the patients who would most likely benefit from ceftazidime with avibactam would be transplant recipients, patients with intensive immunosuppression, those in intensive care and patients who have been admitted to hospital from abroad.\u00a0</p>",
