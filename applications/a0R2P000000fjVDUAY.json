The Committee noted that while M\u0101ori have a lower incidence rate from prostate cancer than non-M\u0101ori men, M\u0101ori have a higher mortality rate from prostate cancer than non-M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=dachs+lancet+cancer+incidence+new+zealand\" target=\"_blank\">Dachs et al. Lancet Oncol. 2008;9:473-84</a>) and thus higher case-fatality rates, and M\u0101ori are more likely to present with or have detected their prostate cancer later than non-M\u0101ori and have more advanced disease at diagnosis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26918691-differences-in-survival-between-maori-and-new-zealand-europeans-with-prostate-cancer/?from_term=differences+in+survival+maori+prostate+cancer&amp;from_pos=1\" target=\"_blank\">Lao et al. Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2016;25:262-8</a>). Members considered that Pacific men have similar incidence of prostate cancer as non-M\u0101ori in New Zealand, but typically have worse outcomes from the disease. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that most patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer receive local treatment (radiation therapy or surgery) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) consisting of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GRH) agonist (goserelin, typically injected in the thigh three-monthly), with or without an anti-androgen such as bicalutamide (taken orally daily) commenced at the same time; overall, the aim of this treatment approach is to reduce testosterone to castrate-levels. The Committee noted that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is prostate cancer that has become resistant to ADT, signalled by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the supplier\u2019s application defined patients with non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastases as those with local (N0) disease or with lymph node involvement (up to N1 staging) and a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of ten months or less. However, the Committee considered that a PSADT of six months or less is more commonly considered to indicate high risk. The Committee considered that M\u0101ori may be overrepresented in the group of patients with high risk nmCRPC, although the reasons for this are uncertain and may represent more aggressive disease or that M\u0101ori have \u2018undiagnosed\u2019 advanced disease at presentation for care.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that standard of care management of patients on ADT consists of three- or six-monthly visits with specialist urology and/or specialist radiation oncology and of supportive care provided by primary care physicians for ongoing prescribing of ADT, administration of goserelin and adverse event management. The Committee noted that bicalutamide may be discontinued at patient or clinician discretion, with ongoing goserelin and surveillance for the development of metastatic disease, at which point a patient would be referred to medical oncology to consider treatment with abiraterone (which is currently funded for patients with metastatic CRPC). </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with nmCRPC are generally asymptomatic with good quality of life (QoL) for their age despite expected side effects from ADT or complications from surgical or radiation treatment e.g. incontinence, bowel symptoms or erectile dysfunction. The Committee considered that prevention of metastases is likely to confer a QoL benefit, noting evidence of health utility values in symptomatic patients (0.625) and in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients (0.830) with metastatic CRPC (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686802\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. Value Health. 2015;18:1152-7</a>). However, the Committee also noted other evidence of the QoL reduction seen in metastatic disease that suggests overall QoL reduction in men with prostate cancer may be primarily driven by the effects of ADT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713036\" target=\"_blank\">Downing et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:436-447</a>). </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that apalutamide is an androgen-receptor inhibitor that binds to the androgen receptor, is then transported into the cell nucleus and affects transcription. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that apalutamide as a 60 mg tablet presentation is Medsafe-registered for the treatment of patients with nmCRPC.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the primary evidence for the health benefits of apalutamide for the treatment of high risk nmCRPC derives from the SPARTAN trial, a randomised (2:1), multicentre, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III clinical trial of oral apalutamide (240 mg per day) or matched placebo, each in combination with ADT (GnRH agonist with or without an anti-androgen) in 1207 adults with castration-resistant adenocarcinoma of the prostate (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420164\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. N Engl J Med. 2018:378;1408-18</a>). The Committee noted that the treatment was continued until development of metastases, death, discontinuation due to adverse event or consent withdrawal, and median follow-up at analysis was 20.3 months. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that SPARTAN included participants of median age 74 years, that ~77% of participants had prior local treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy) and that ~73% had received a first-generation anti-androgen agent. The Committee noted that patients were defined as being at high risk of developing metastases if they had PSADT \u2264 10 months, that the median baseline PSADT was about 4.5 months, and that participants were stratified by PSADT: (&gt;6 months (29%) vs \u22646 months (71%). </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that metastasis-free survival (MFS, defined as development of metastatic disease or death) was the primary outcome of SPARTAN; the authors\u2019 rationale for this being the long OS expected in this population and the supposedly close correlation between MFS and OS in this setting. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the authors reported the primary outcome after 378 events (184 [22.8%] apalutamide vs 194 [48.4%] placebo) being a median MFS of 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 16.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; P&lt;0.001). The Committee noted the incidence of bone metastasis was similar between apalutamide (60.5%) and placebo (54.4%).</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median progression-free survival (PFS) at this analysis was 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 14.7 months with placebo; HR \u00a00.29 (95% CI 0.24-0.36), P&lt;0.001. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted SPARTAN also reported PFS2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression after a subsequent therapy, which was one of four exploratory only endpoints in the trial. The Committee considered that the PFS2 effects with apalutamide was mostly derived from the PFS effects. The Committee considered the PFS2 results were consistent, with no detrimental impacts with apalutamide on the effects of subsequent treatments. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that dose reductions occurred in SPARTAN to manage side effects, of which the most common were fatigue, hypertension and rash. The Committee noted that treatment was discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) in 10.6% of apalutamide patients vs 7.0% of placebo patients and that grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious AEs were reported in 45.1% and 24.8% of apalutamide patients and 34.2% and 23.1% of placebo patients, respectively.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the mean dose intensity was 218 mg, as calculated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in their <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-apalutamide-190325.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Assessment Report for Apalutamide, March 2019 [Internet]. </a></p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of health-related quality of life (QoL) in the SPARTAN trial treatment and post-progression follow-up periods (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213449-effect-of-apalutamide-on-health-related-quality-of-life-in-patients-with-non-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-an-analysis-of-the-spartan-randomised-placebo-controlled-phase-3-trial/?dopt=Abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Saad et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018:19;1404-16</a>), and considered that the reporting of QoL as percentages instead of utility values limited the interpretation of this data. The Committee noted that the QoL of patients in SPARTAN was not diminished by treatment with apalutamide compared with placebo, and that the QoL of symptomatic metastatic patients compared with those without metastases was not assessed. The Committee noted that there was no evidence of a QoL benefit from apalutamide in patients with high-risk nmCRPC for whom development of metastasis was delayed, but considered a benefit is possible due to the modest benefit in QoL from MFS in its own right (despite any effects of ADT). </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a second pre-specified interim analysis (IA2) of OS in the SPARTAN trial after median follow-up of 41 months (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31560066\" target=\"_blank\">Small et al. Ann Oncol. 2019:30;1813-20</a>), which were also presented at the <a href=\"https://www.urotoday.com/conference-highlights/esmo-2019/esmo-2019-prostate-cancer/115202-esmo-2019-updated-results-from-the-phase-3-spartan-study-apalutamide-and-overall-survival-in-patients-with-nonmetastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in Barcelona, Spain</a>. The Committee noted that IA2 had occurred when 285 OS events had accrued; i.e. 65% of the 427 events planned to be used for the planned final OS analysis. The Committee also noted that the four year OS rates were 72.1% with apalutamide compared with 64.7% with placebo, and the hazard ratio for death with apalutamide compared with placebo was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.96, <i>P</i>=0.02), however, this result did not cross the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.012 and therefore did not meet statistical significance. The Committee noted that no new safety signals were observed at this analysis. </p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the SPARTAN trial follow-up data in late years was based on small patient numbers, and considered that the OS data was confounded by subsequent use of other therapies for metastatic CRPC (reported in 40% of apalutamide patients and in 69% of placebo patients; subsequent therapy included abiraterone in ~75% of cases). </p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a large, independent study that included meta-analysis of MFS using data from 19 trials that enrolled 12,712 participants with localised prostate cancer from 1987 to 2011, with median follow-up of ten years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796587\" target=\"_blank\">Xie et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:3097-104</a>). The Committee noted the correlation between MFS at five years and OS at eight years, and considered that there appeared to be a delayed benefit in terms of OS. The Committee noted that Xie et al. reported that longer MFS correlated with longer OS at least 90% of the time. </p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of an analysis of MFS and OS from the SPARTAN trial, which reported reduced life expectancy following development of metastasis and suggested a close relationship between MFS and OS in high risk nmCRPC (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31980408\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al.

The Committee noted that while M\u0101ori have a lower incidence rate from prostate cancer than non-M\u0101ori men, M\u0101ori have a higher mortality rate from prostate cancer than non-M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=dachs+lancet+cancer+incidence+new+zealand\" target=\"_blank\">Dachs et al. Lancet Oncol. 2008;9:473-84</a>) and thus higher case-fatality rates, and M\u0101ori are more likely to present with or have detected their prostate cancer later than non-M\u0101ori and have more advanced disease at diagnosis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26918691-differences-in-survival-between-maori-and-new-zealand-europeans-with-prostate-cancer/?from_term=differences+in+survival+maori+prostate+cancer&amp;from_pos=1\" target=\"_blank\">Lao et al. Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2016;25:262-8</a>).

The Committee noted that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is prostate cancer that has become resistant to ADT, signalled by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the supplier\u2019s application defined patients with non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastases as those with local (N0) disease or with lymph node involvement (up to N1 staging) and a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of ten months or less. However, the Committee considered that a PSADT of six months or less is more commonly considered to indicate high risk. The Committee considered that M\u0101ori may be overrepresented in the group of patients with high risk nmCRPC, although the reasons for this are uncertain and may represent more aggressive disease or that M\u0101ori have \u2018undiagnosed\u2019 advanced disease at presentation for care.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that standard of care management of patients on ADT consists of three- or six-monthly visits with specialist urology and/or specialist radiation oncology and of supportive care provided by primary care physicians for ongoing prescribing of ADT, administration of goserelin and adverse event management. The Committee noted that bicalutamide may be discontinued at patient or clinician discretion, with ongoing goserelin and surveillance for the development of metastatic disease, at which point a patient would be referred to medical oncology to consider treatment with abiraterone (which is currently funded for patients with metastatic CRPC). </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with nmCRPC are generally asymptomatic with good quality of life (QoL) for their age despite expected side effects from ADT or complications from surgical or radiation treatment e.g. incontinence, bowel symptoms or erectile dysfunction. The Committee considered that prevention of metastases is likely to confer a QoL benefit, noting evidence of health utility values in symptomatic patients (0.625) and in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients (0.830) with metastatic CRPC (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686802\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. Value Health. 2015;18:1152-7</a>). However, the Committee also noted other evidence of the QoL reduction seen in metastatic disease that suggests overall QoL reduction in men with prostate cancer may be primarily driven by the effects of ADT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713036\" target=\"_blank\">Downing et al.

N Engl J Med. 2018:378;1408-18</a>).

The Committee noted that patients were defined as being at high risk of developing metastases if they had PSADT \u2264 10 months, that the median baseline PSADT was about 4.5 months, and that participants were stratified by PSADT: (&gt;6 months (29%) vs \u22646 months (71%). </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that metastasis-free survival (MFS, defined as development of metastatic disease or death) was the primary outcome of SPARTAN; the authors\u2019 rationale for this being the long OS expected in this population and the supposedly close correlation between MFS and OS in this setting. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the authors reported the primary outcome after 378 events (184 [22.8%] apalutamide vs 194 [48.4%] placebo) being a median MFS of 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 16.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; P&lt;0.001).

The Committee considered that the PFS2 effects with apalutamide was mostly derived from the PFS effects. The Committee considered the PFS2 results were consistent, with no detrimental impacts with apalutamide on the effects of subsequent treatments. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that dose reductions occurred in SPARTAN to manage side effects, of which the most common were fatigue, hypertension and rash. The Committee noted that treatment was discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) in 10.6% of apalutamide patients vs 7.0% of placebo patients and that grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious AEs were reported in 45.1% and 24.8% of apalutamide patients and 34.2% and 23.1% of placebo patients, respectively.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the mean dose intensity was 218 mg, as calculated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in their <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-apalutamide-190325.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Assessment Report for Apalutamide, March 2019 [Internet]. </a></p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of health-related quality of life (QoL) in the SPARTAN trial treatment and post-progression follow-up periods (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213449-effect-of-apalutamide-on-health-related-quality-of-life-in-patients-with-non-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-an-analysis-of-the-spartan-randomised-placebo-controlled-phase-3-trial/?dopt=Abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Saad et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018:19;1404-16</a>), and considered that the reporting of QoL as percentages instead of utility values limited the interpretation of this data. The Committee noted that the QoL of patients in SPARTAN was not diminished by treatment with apalutamide compared with placebo, and that the QoL of symptomatic metastatic patients compared with those without metastases was not assessed. The Committee noted that there was no evidence of a QoL benefit from apalutamide in patients with high-risk nmCRPC for whom development of metastasis was delayed, but considered a benefit is possible due to the modest benefit in QoL from MFS in its own right (despite any effects of ADT). </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a second pre-specified interim analysis (IA2) of OS in the SPARTAN trial after median follow-up of 41 months (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31560066\" target=\"_blank\">Small et al.

The Committee noted that IA2 had occurred when 285 OS events had accrued; i.e. 65% of the 427 events planned to be used for the planned final OS analysis. The Committee also noted that the four year OS rates were 72.1% with apalutamide compared with 64.7% with placebo, and the hazard ratio for death with apalutamide compared with placebo was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.96, <i>P</i>=0.02), however, this result did not cross the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.012 and therefore did not meet statistical significance.

This was due to the lack of a statistically significant difference in OS, which could relate to the control needed for multiple sequential analyses from having pre-specified interim analyses (Type I error inflation), insufficient OS events accruing for final analysis, and the confounding impact of subsequent therapies; and that the study was not powered to meet the specific endpoint of OS (OS being simply a secondary endpoint, alongside four others).</p><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that based on the currently available trial data (noting the TITAN trial evidence in metastatic CRPC, which reported a statistically significant OS benefit with apalutamide at two years), it appears that apalutamide may confer a delayed OS benefit in high risk nmCRPC; but that, as the OS data for apalutamide is currently immature, the final OS analysis of the SPARTAN trial would be required to inform the magnitude of any OS benefit in this setting. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee reiterated its view (paragraph 8.20 above) that the strength of the relationship between MFS and OS in nmCRPC remained to be clearly defined, and limits to its usefulness of MFS as a surrogate outcome.</p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that ADT alone would be the current standard of care comparator for patients with high risk nmCRPC. </p><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if funded, the addition of apalutamide to ADT in high risk nmCRPC would delay but not otherwise change the usage of abiraterone in metastatic CRPC.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Committee noted that, in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2020</a>, PTAC reviewed the application for apalutamide (Erlyand) for the treatment of high-risk, nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR nmCRPC). At that time, the Committee:</p><p><br></p><p>Recommended that the application for apalutamide for high-risk, nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) be deferred, due to the lack of a statistically significant change in overall survival (OS), which the Committee considered to be the primary potential benefit of apalutamide, and no reported evidence for quality of life improvement with apalutamide; and</p><p>Requested advice from the Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) regarding: the appropriate timing for its review of this application; likely patient numbers; the impact apalutamide may have on subsequent abiraterone use for patients with metastatic disease; the health need for another agent for high risk nmCRPC in a New Zealand setting; any evidence to support optimal sequencing of this class of agents and abiraterone; the value of metastasis-free survival (MFS) as a surrogate for OS in high risk nmCRPC with supporting evidence for this; views on the proposed Special Authority criteria; and whether there is a class effect from use of these agents.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the supplier\u2019s response to the February 2020 PTAC record, which included conference presentation slides regarding the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the SPARTAN clinical trial data and publication of the final SPARTAN OS data (Smith MR, et al. Apalutamide and Overall Survival in Prostate Cancer. Eur Urol. 2020:S0302-2838(20)30628-X, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.08.011\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.08.011</a>]). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that OS was a pre-specified secondary outcome of the SPARTAN trial, and testing of OS was based on a prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming-type alpha-spending function. The Committee noted that after median follow-up of 50.4 months, the final OS data from SPARTAN reported a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.78 with apalutamide compared with placebo (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.96; <i>P</i>= 0.016) in the intention-to-treat population, with the P value crossing the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.046 and upper limit of the 95% confidence interval approaching 1. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that 84% of patients who received placebo in SPARTAN crossed over to receive apalutamide or other active therapy, and that the first subsequent therapy received by about three-quarters of patients in the apalutamide and placebo groups, respectively, was abiraterone acetate with prednisone. The Committee noted the two exploratory OS sensitivity analyses\u2019 results after adjustment for patient crossover from placebo to apalutamide [HR 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84); nominal <i>P</i> = 0.0002] and considered these results were consistent with patients who received abiraterone post-apalutamide not being disadvantaged in terms of overall survival outcome. Members considered that, for cost-effectiveness modelling purposes, the hazard ratio for OS after adjustment for crossover could be representative of clinical benefit from apalutamide in New Zealand, and considered this could inform subsequent analysis using appropriate sensitivity analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, overall, its interpretation of the benefit of apalutamide from the OS data was limited by reservations and a lack of clarity regarding adjustments for the multiple sequential SPARTAN trial statistical analyses. This included:</p><p>Members could not replicate the P values for adjustment for multiple looks at the data and the O\u2019Brien-Fleming based alpha bounds were likely overspent during the multiple analyses, consequently the P value was likely too precise, and that the confidence intervals were consequently likely wider than reported (with appropriate alpha-levels for multiple measurement requiring confidence limits beyond 95%). </p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that OS for this study was a secondary outcome (one of many), so even with an adjustment for repeated measurements within a variable with sequential analysis, there would still be unaccounted type I error inflation.

At that time, PTAC requested Pharmac seek specific advice from CaTSoP to assist in its assessment of the application.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, PTAC noted the supplier\u2019s response to its February 2020 record, reiterated its previous recommendation to defer the application, and considered that specialised advice from CaTSoP (in the setting of emerging evidence for other similar agents for this indication) remained important to inform assessment of this application. At that time, PTAC noted that, although a health benefit of apalutamide was reported in terms of OS in the SPARTAN trial, there remained reservations about the validity of the estimate of OS in that trial. PTAC also considered that there was an ongoing lack of reported evidence for quality-of-life improvement with apalutamide and that no additional health-related quality of life data was provided for assessment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>, PTAC noted a letter from the supplier regarding the evaluation of the statistical methods utilised in the analysis of the SPARTAN trial. Members considered that there remained some concern regarding the alpha-spending (with potential false positive results) but considered that the survival analyses conducted to account for crossover of patients from placebo to the apalutamide group did support an OS advantage for apalutamide. PTAC had noted that this data was formally published in a peer-reviewed journal and considered that this could be used by Pharmac in a cost-effectiveness analysis of apalutamide. PTAC had noted that the supplier had not provided data summaries that would support a critical appraisal of the views the supplier expressed regarding health-related quality of life for patients receiving apalutamide treatment. PTAC had considered that further advice should still be sought from CaTSoP.</p><p>8.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac received correspondence from the supplier in April 2021 (in response to the February 2021 PTAC record) and received further information from the supplier in September 2021 regarding the application for apalutamide, including the 2021 publication of the final OS analysis.</p><p>8.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high rate of prostate cancer in New Zealand and recognised the health needs of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as previously discussed by PTAC. The Subcommittee noted that there is slightly lower incidence of prostate cancer in M\u0101ori compared with non-M\u0101ori, but that M\u0101ori are more likely to present with advanced disease and therefore have a higher mortality rate. The Subcommittee considered the application for apalutamide targeted a specific population with poor prognosis from prostate cancer and considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples more often present at this point in the disease course.</p><p>8.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the application was for apalutamide for patients whose non-metastatic prostate cancer is no longer responding to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (ie castration-resistant) and that ADT would continue alongside treatment with apalutamide. The Subcommittee noted that there are no specific funded treatments for non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC). The Subcommittee noted that patients with metastatic disease may receive docetaxel chemotherapy and may be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate.</p><p>8.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the prognostic value of the PSA doubling time (PSADT) in identifying patients at high risk of disease progression, with shorter doubling times representing a worse prognosis. The Subcommittee noted the application proposed a PSADT of 10 months for apalutamide eligibility; members noted that this threshold correlated with a sharp increase in the risk of death from metastatic disease in prostate cancer, as published by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24043751/\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2013;31:3800-6</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the PSADT threshold used internationally varies between eight to 10 months but that a shorter timeframe of six months is often used in some clinical practice.</p><p>8.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that routine PSA monitoring is performed 3-monthly in New Zealand for patients at high risk of disease progression. On balance, the Subcommittee considered it would be appropriate to use a PSADT of 10 months to identify the high-risk population in the funding criteria for apalutamide because this aligns with the evidence base and would not inappropriately exclude any patients whose PSA doubling occurred between six and 10 months.</p><p>8.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimate of about 90 patients per year who would be eligible for apalutamide was likely too high based on clinical practice, noting that only about 10 patients per year in Auckland would fit the criteria. The Subcommittee noted that 29% of patients in the SPARTAN trial had a PSADT of between six to 10 months and considered that even with such patients included in the estimate, the true number of eligible patients would be less than proposed. The Subcommittee considered that any increase in access to more sensitive screening methods (eg PSMA PET-CT, currently self-funded) would affect patient numbers by earlier detection of metastatic disease, creating further uncertainty around this number.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence for the safety and efficacy of apalutamide comes from the phase III, randomised (2:1) SPARTAN trial, as considered previously by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>. The Subcommittee considered that SPARTAN was a high-quality study and noted that it included participants from the Asia Pacific region but not New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that 70% of participants had PSADT of less than six months and that participant characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of clinical importance was metastasis-free survival (MFS), and the Subcommittee considered this outcome measure would include bone-related endpoints.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that median MFS in the SPARTAN primary analysis was 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 16.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35;\u00a0P&lt;0.001), although the number of patients remaining in follow-up after 24 months was low (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420164\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. N Engl J Med. 2018:378;1408-18</a>). The Subcommittee considered there was a benefit in MFS from apalutamide regardless of whether PSADT was &lt;6 months or &gt;6 months, supporting apalutamide treatment for those with PSADT of up to 10 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to symptomatic disease progression was not reached in either group.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint of SPARTAN and that the final OS analysis was performed after median 50.4 months follow-up (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030228382030628X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. Eur Urol. 2021;79:150-8</a>). As noted by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, the authors reported a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.78 with apalutamide compared with placebo (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.96; P= 0.016) in the intention-to-treat population with the P value crossing the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.046; after adjustment for patient crossover from placebo to apalutamide the reported exploratory OS sensitivity analyses\u2019 results was (HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84]; nominal P = 0.0002). The Subcommittee considered that the trial\u2019s statistical analysis was appropriately designed with hierarchical testing of outcomes at interim and final analyses, and with adjusted OS analyses appropriately accounting for treatment crossover. The Subcommittee considered that this provided evidence of an OS benefit from apalutamide in nmCRPC.</p><p>8.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with apalutamide was well tolerated by SPARTAN trial participants who would otherwise have received ADT alone. The Subcommittee noted that a small proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and considered that these events were similar between groups in terms of their management and cost, with rash being the most significant event requiring additional management (GP visits or oncology phone consultation) and tending to occur early in the treatment course.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that preserving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was particularly important for patients with nmCRPC during the periods of time between lines of chemotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that HRQoL was not diminished during maintenance treatment with apalutamide in SPARTAN, and that some HRQoL measures (FACT-P; FACT-G) decreased at relapse as expected (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34479838/\" target=\"_blank\">Oudard et al. Prostate Cancer. 2021; EUF-1177</a>). The Subcommittee noted that HRQoL appeared similar between treatment groups until around 18 months, where HRQoL improved with apalutamide maintenance treatment compared with a decrease in HRQoL in the placebo group; the Subcommittee considered this was likely due to increased MFS with apalutamide as opposed to any treatment-specific difference not related to MFS.

At that time, PTAC requested Pharmac seek specific advice from CaTSoP to assist in its assessment of the application.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, PTAC noted the supplier\u2019s response to its February 2020 record, reiterated its previous recommendation to defer the application, and considered that specialised advice from CaTSoP (in the setting of emerging evidence for other similar agents for this indication) remained important to inform assessment of this application. At that time, PTAC noted that, although a health benefit of apalutamide was reported in terms of OS in the SPARTAN trial, there remained reservations about the validity of the estimate of OS in that trial. PTAC also considered that there was an ongoing lack of reported evidence for quality-of-life improvement with apalutamide and that no additional health-related quality of life data was provided for assessment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>, PTAC noted a letter from the supplier regarding the evaluation of the statistical methods utilised in the analysis of the SPARTAN trial. Members considered that there remained some concern regarding the alpha-spending (with potential false positive results) but considered that the survival analyses conducted to account for crossover of patients from placebo to the apalutamide group did support an OS advantage for apalutamide. PTAC had noted that this data was formally published in a peer-reviewed journal and considered that this could be used by Pharmac in a cost-effectiveness analysis of apalutamide. PTAC had noted that the supplier had not provided data summaries that would support a critical appraisal of the views the supplier expressed regarding health-related quality of life for patients receiving apalutamide treatment. PTAC had considered that further advice should still be sought from CaTSoP.</p><p>8.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac received correspondence from the supplier in April 2021 (in response to the February 2021 PTAC record) and received further information from the supplier in September 2021 regarding the application for apalutamide, including the 2021 publication of the final OS analysis.</p><p>8.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high rate of prostate cancer in New Zealand and recognised the health needs of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as previously discussed by PTAC. The Subcommittee noted that there is slightly lower incidence of prostate cancer in M\u0101ori compared with non-M\u0101ori, but that M\u0101ori are more likely to present with advanced disease and therefore have a higher mortality rate. The Subcommittee considered the application for apalutamide targeted a specific population with poor prognosis from prostate cancer and considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples more often present at this point in the disease course.</p><p>8.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the application was for apalutamide for patients whose non-metastatic prostate cancer is no longer responding to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (ie castration-resistant) and that ADT would continue alongside treatment with apalutamide. The Subcommittee noted that there are no specific funded treatments for non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC). The Subcommittee noted that patients with metastatic disease may receive docetaxel chemotherapy and may be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate.</p><p>8.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the prognostic value of the PSA doubling time (PSADT) in identifying patients at high risk of disease progression, with shorter doubling times representing a worse prognosis. The Subcommittee noted the application proposed a PSADT of 10 months for apalutamide eligibility; members noted that this threshold correlated with a sharp increase in the risk of death from metastatic disease in prostate cancer, as published by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24043751/\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2013;31:3800-6</a>).

On balance, the Subcommittee considered it would be appropriate to use a PSADT of 10 months to identify the high-risk population in the funding criteria for apalutamide because this aligns with the evidence base and would not inappropriately exclude any patients whose PSA doubling occurred between six and 10 months.</p><p>8.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimate of about 90 patients per year who would be eligible for apalutamide was likely too high based on clinical practice, noting that only about 10 patients per year in Auckland would fit the criteria. The Subcommittee noted that 29% of patients in the SPARTAN trial had a PSADT of between six to 10 months and considered that even with such patients included in the estimate, the true number of eligible patients would be less than proposed. The Subcommittee considered that any increase in access to more sensitive screening methods (eg PSMA PET-CT, currently self-funded) would affect patient numbers by earlier detection of metastatic disease, creating further uncertainty around this number.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence for the safety and efficacy of apalutamide comes from the phase III, randomised (2:1) SPARTAN trial, as considered previously by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>. The Subcommittee considered that SPARTAN was a high-quality study and noted that it included participants from the Asia Pacific region but not New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that 70% of participants had PSADT of less than six months and that participant characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of clinical importance was metastasis-free survival (MFS), and the Subcommittee considered this outcome measure would include bone-related endpoints.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that median MFS in the SPARTAN primary analysis was 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 16.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35;\u00a0P&lt;0.001), although the number of patients remaining in follow-up after 24 months was low (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420164\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. N Engl J Med. 2018:378;1408-18</a>). The Subcommittee considered there was a benefit in MFS from apalutamide regardless of whether PSADT was &lt;6 months or &gt;6 months, supporting apalutamide treatment for those with PSADT of up to 10 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to symptomatic disease progression was not reached in either group.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint of SPARTAN and that the final OS analysis was performed after median 50.4 months follow-up (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030228382030628X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al.

As noted by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, the authors reported a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.78 with apalutamide compared with placebo (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.96; P= 0.016) in the intention-to-treat population with the P value crossing the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.046; after adjustment for patient crossover from placebo to apalutamide the reported exploratory OS sensitivity analyses\u2019 results was (HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84]; nominal P = 0.0002). The Subcommittee considered that the trial\u2019s statistical analysis was appropriately designed with hierarchical testing of outcomes at interim and final analyses, and with adjusted OS analyses appropriately accounting for treatment crossover. The Subcommittee considered that this provided evidence of an OS benefit from apalutamide in nmCRPC.</p><p>8.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with apalutamide was well tolerated by SPARTAN trial participants who would otherwise have received ADT alone. The Subcommittee noted that a small proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and considered that these events were similar between groups in terms of their management and cost, with rash being the most significant event requiring additional management (GP visits or oncology phone consultation) and tending to occur early in the treatment course.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that preserving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was particularly important for patients with nmCRPC during the periods of time between lines of chemotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that HRQoL was not diminished during maintenance treatment with apalutamide in SPARTAN, and that some HRQoL measures (FACT-P; FACT-G) decreased at relapse as expected (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34479838/\" target=\"_blank\">Oudard et al.

At that time, PTAC requested Pharmac seek specific advice from CaTSoP to assist in its assessment of the application.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, PTAC noted the supplier\u2019s response to its February 2020 record, reiterated its previous recommendation to defer the application, and considered that specialised advice from CaTSoP (in the setting of emerging evidence for other similar agents for this indication) remained important to inform assessment of this application. At that time, PTAC noted that, although a health benefit of apalutamide was reported in terms of OS in the SPARTAN trial, there remained reservations about the validity of the estimate of OS in that trial. PTAC also considered that there was an ongoing lack of reported evidence for quality-of-life improvement with apalutamide and that no additional health-related quality of life data was provided for assessment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>, PTAC noted a letter from the supplier regarding the evaluation of the statistical methods utilised in the analysis of the SPARTAN trial. Members considered that there remained some concern regarding the alpha-spending (with potential false positive results) but considered that the survival analyses conducted to account for crossover of patients from placebo to the apalutamide group did support an OS advantage for apalutamide. PTAC had noted that this data was formally published in a peer-reviewed journal and considered that this could be used by Pharmac in a cost-effectiveness analysis of apalutamide. PTAC had noted that the supplier had not provided data summaries that would support a critical appraisal of the views the supplier expressed regarding health-related quality of life for patients receiving apalutamide treatment. PTAC had considered that further advice should still be sought from CaTSoP.</p><p>8.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac received correspondence from the supplier in April 2021 (in response to the February 2021 PTAC record) and received further information from the supplier in September 2021 regarding the application for apalutamide, including the 2021 publication of the final OS analysis.</p><p>8.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high rate of prostate cancer in New Zealand and recognised the health needs of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as previously discussed by PTAC. The Subcommittee noted that there is slightly lower incidence of prostate cancer in M\u0101ori compared with non-M\u0101ori, but that M\u0101ori are more likely to present with advanced disease and therefore have a higher mortality rate. The Subcommittee considered the application for apalutamide targeted a specific population with poor prognosis from prostate cancer and considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples more often present at this point in the disease course.</p><p>8.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the application was for apalutamide for patients whose non-metastatic prostate cancer is no longer responding to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (ie castration-resistant) and that ADT would continue alongside treatment with apalutamide. The Subcommittee noted that there are no specific funded treatments for non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC). The Subcommittee noted that patients with metastatic disease may receive docetaxel chemotherapy and may be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate.</p><p>8.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the prognostic value of the PSA doubling time (PSADT) in identifying patients at high risk of disease progression, with shorter doubling times representing a worse prognosis. The Subcommittee noted the application proposed a PSADT of 10 months for apalutamide eligibility; members noted that this threshold correlated with a sharp increase in the risk of death from metastatic disease in prostate cancer, as published by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24043751/\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2013;31:3800-6</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the PSADT threshold used internationally varies between eight to 10 months but that a shorter timeframe of six months is often used in some clinical practice.</p><p>8.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that routine PSA monitoring is performed 3-monthly in New Zealand for patients at high risk of disease progression. On balance, the Subcommittee considered it would be appropriate to use a PSADT of 10 months to identify the high-risk population in the funding criteria for apalutamide because this aligns with the evidence base and would not inappropriately exclude any patients whose PSA doubling occurred between six and 10 months.</p><p>8.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimate of about 90 patients per year who would be eligible for apalutamide was likely too high based on clinical practice, noting that only about 10 patients per year in Auckland would fit the criteria. The Subcommittee noted that 29% of patients in the SPARTAN trial had a PSADT of between six to 10 months and considered that even with such patients included in the estimate, the true number of eligible patients would be less than proposed. The Subcommittee considered that any increase in access to more sensitive screening methods (eg PSMA PET-CT, currently self-funded) would affect patient numbers by earlier detection of metastatic disease, creating further uncertainty around this number.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence for the safety and efficacy of apalutamide comes from the phase III, randomised (2:1) SPARTAN trial, as considered previously by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2021</a>. The Subcommittee considered that SPARTAN was a high-quality study and noted that it included participants from the Asia Pacific region but not New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that 70% of participants had PSADT of less than six months and that participant characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of clinical importance was metastasis-free survival (MFS), and the Subcommittee considered this outcome measure would include bone-related endpoints.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that median MFS in the SPARTAN primary analysis was 40.5 months with apalutamide vs 16.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35;\u00a0P&lt;0.001), although the number of patients remaining in follow-up after 24 months was low (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420164\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. N Engl J Med. 2018:378;1408-18</a>). The Subcommittee considered there was a benefit in MFS from apalutamide regardless of whether PSADT was &lt;6 months or &gt;6 months, supporting apalutamide treatment for those with PSADT of up to 10 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to symptomatic disease progression was not reached in either group.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint of SPARTAN and that the final OS analysis was performed after median 50.4 months follow-up (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030228382030628X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. Eur Urol. 2021;79:150-8</a>). As noted by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>, the authors reported a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.78 with apalutamide compared with placebo (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.96; P= 0.016) in the intention-to-treat population with the P value crossing the prespecified O\u2019Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.046; after adjustment for patient crossover from placebo to apalutamide the reported exploratory OS sensitivity analyses\u2019 results was (HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84]; nominal P = 0.0002). The Subcommittee considered that the trial\u2019s statistical analysis was appropriately designed with hierarchical testing of outcomes at interim and final analyses, and with adjusted OS analyses appropriately accounting for treatment crossover. The Subcommittee considered that this provided evidence of an OS benefit from apalutamide in nmCRPC.</p><p>8.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with apalutamide was well tolerated by SPARTAN trial participants who would otherwise have received ADT alone. The Subcommittee noted that a small proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and considered that these events were similar between groups in terms of their management and cost, with rash being the most significant event requiring additional management (GP visits or oncology phone consultation) and tending to occur early in the treatment course.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that preserving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was particularly important for patients with nmCRPC during the periods of time between lines of chemotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that HRQoL was not diminished during maintenance treatment with apalutamide in SPARTAN, and that some HRQoL measures (FACT-P; FACT-G) decreased at relapse as expected (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34479838/\" target=\"_blank\">Oudard et al. Prostate Cancer. 2021; EUF-1177</a>). The Subcommittee noted that HRQoL appeared similar between treatment groups until around 18 months, where HRQoL improved with apalutamide maintenance treatment compared with a decrease in HRQoL in the placebo group; the Subcommittee considered this was likely due to increased MFS with apalutamide as opposed to any treatment-specific difference not related to MFS. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence was reasonable for its assessment of the benefit of apalutamide maintenance treatment and that no further HRQoL information was required.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that SPARTAN provided evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit in metastasis free survival MFS and an OS benefit from treatment with apalutamide in nmCRPC across all subgroups, with no decrement in HRQOL during maintenance treatment with apalutamide and a tolerable side effect profile.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the meta-analysis of apalutamide, darolutamide and enzalutamide in nmCRPC (<a href=\"https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fon-2020-1104?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Roumigui\u00e9 et al. Future Oncol. 2021;17:1811-23</a>). The Subcommittee considered that a cross-trial comparison of these treatments was limited by differences between the clinical trials (eg less chemotherapy received by SPARTAN trial patients and three-quarters of SPARTAN participants subsequently receiving abiraterone acetate with prednisone). However, the Subcommittee considered that survival appeared similar with apalutamide, darolutamide and enzalutamide in nmCRPC and that there may be a class effect among these treatments in this setting with no clear superiority of one treatment over the others. The Subcommittee considered that there may be differences between these treatments in toxicity profiles and their binding properties in the presence of androgen receptor mutations, as noted by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>.</p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was an absence of direct evidence to inform the optimal sequencing of apalutamide and abiraterone acetate (which have different mechanisms of action), although some retrospective studies have looked at sequential use and combination use of these treatments. The Subcommittee considered that about 10% of patients may respond to a second therapy and that chemotherapy in between treatments did not appear to offer much additional benefit, although there may be differing views among clinicians. The Subcommittee noted that New Zealand clinicians have experience using abiraterone acetate but considered it was unclear whether abiraterone would be preferred over apalutamide, if both were funded; providing options for metastatic and non-metastatic treatment, respectively; and considered that the best time to use these treatments remained unclear.</p><p>8.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac had received funding applications for abiraterone acetate to be used in other indications including hormone sensitive prostate cancer and considered that the application for apalutamide would not affect those indications that are at an earlier point in the disease course. The Subcommittee considered that funding apalutamide for nmCRPC would change the subsequent use of abiraterone acetate for metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) and that the Special Authority criteria for abiraterone acetate for mCRPC may require amendment to restrict use of abiraterone to apalutamide-na\u00efve patients with mCRPC, given the likely 10% response rate to subsequent therapy. The Subcommittee noted that it would be reasonable for apalutamide to be prescribed by Medical Oncologists, Radiation Oncologists or Urologists, therefore facilitating access across the country from a range of specialist prescribers.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that radiologic confirmation of non-metastatic disease by CT scan or better (including PSMA PET-CT) would be appropriate to confirm eligibility for funded apalutamide, The Subcommittee considered that monitoring on treatment might include annual imaging if PSA was rising or if there were clinical concerns, however, adding a requirement for radiologic confirmation of non-metastatic disease at renewal would not be appropriate.</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that no additional radiotherapy would be expected with apalutamide as a result of prolonging the time to development of metastasis.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the type of clinic resource use to manage patients with nmCRPC receiving apalutamide would vary around the country as patients may be monitored by Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology or Urology depending on the region. The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimated resource use was too frequent and that patients might initially have Medical Oncology or GP visits (potentially via phone or Zoom to assess toxicity after one month on treatment, with management for patients who experience rash), followed by three-monthly PSA monitoring and specialist clinic visits every three to four months on average. The Subcommittee considered that management of rash would not be expected to require a hospital visit or incur substantial additional cost.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) </span>information<span style=\"color: black;\"> for apalutamide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for high-risk, non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.
