The Subcommittee noted that 49% of patients had visceral disease at baseline, 48%\u00a0of patients had received prior chemotherapy, and 21% of patients had received prior\u00a0treatment with anastrozole or letrozole.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, after a median follow-up of 23 months, that the median\u00a0investigator-assessed PFS (primary endpoint), in the PALOMA-2 trial was 24.8 months in\u00a0the palbociclib arm compared with 14.5 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46,\u00a00.72; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the objective response rates were 55.3%\u00a0in the palbociclib arm compared with 44.4% in the placebo arm (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.05,\u00a02.28; P=0.03), and that the clinical benefit rate was 84.3% compared with 70.8% (OR\u00a02.23; 95% CI, 1.39, 3.56; P&lt;0.001), respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the\u00a0median duration of response for patients who achieved a complete or partial response\u00a0was 22.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 16.8 months in the placebo arm.\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the OS data were immature at the time of the primary\u00a0analysis.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the rates of anaemia, haematological adverse events,\u00a0alopecia, diarrhoea, and stomatitis in PALOMA-2 were higher in the palbociclib arm\u00a0compared with the placebo arm. The Subcommittee noted that any grade neutropenia\u00a0was reported for 79.5% of patients in the palbociclib arm, but that grade 3 or 4 febrile\u00a0neutropenia was reported in only 1.8% of patients. The Subcommittee noted that 36.0%\u00a0of patients in the palbociclib arm had dose reductions compared with 1.4% in the placebo\u00a0arm, and that 9.4% of patients in the palbociclib arm discontinued due to adverse events\u00a0compared with 1.4% of patients in the placebo arm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if palbociclib were funded, this would likely result in\u00a0additional hospital visits related to toxicity and additional blood tests for neutropenia may\u00a0also be required; in the absence of significant toxicity and neutropenia, patients would\u00a0likely undergo regular follow-ups every 6-months.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the quality-of-life (QoL) results of PALOMA-2, which identified\u00a0that the addition of palbociclib to letrozole delayed deterioration in health-related QoL\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360932\" target=\"_blank\">Rugo et al.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that approximately 3000 women are diagnosed with breast\u00a0cancer each year in New Zealand, that an unknown proportion will progress from localized\u00a0to advanced disease, and that approximately 20% of patients will have locally advanced\u00a0or metastatic disease at diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that approximately\u00a055%\u201365% of patients with advanced disease will have hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that estimating the number of patients who would be\u00a0eligible for treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic\u00a0breast cancer per year in New Zealand was difficult; but considered that the applicant\u2019s\u00a0estimate of approximately 550 eligible patients per year was likely high.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if eligibility criteria did not specifically exclude it, it was\u00a0likely that the approximately 20%\u201325% of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative\u00a0locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are premenopausal/perimenopausal\u00a0would undergo ovarian suppression to fit eligibility criteria as \u2018postmenopausal\u2019.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of an observational study of 815 patients with\u00a0metastatic breast cancer in the Netherlands that identified a median survival of 24.8\u00a0months for patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, compared\u00a0with 34.4 months for HR-positive/HER2-positive disease, 19.8 months for HR-negative/HER2-positive disease, and 8.8 months for triple-negative disease (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104881\" target=\"_blank\">Lobbezoo et\u00a0al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2013;141:507-14</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the currently funded first-line treatments for advanced\u00a0HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer include aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the uptake of palbociclib, if funded, would likely be\u00a0high as endocrine therapies are the only currently funded agents for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, the\u00a0Subcommittee considered that in the first few years of listing there were would likely be a\u00a0significant number of prevalent patients seeking treatment due to the long duration of\u00a0survival with hormonal agents.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is a reversible inhibitor of the cyclic-dependent\u00a0kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, which are critical components of the cell-cycle regulatory\u00a0machinery. The Subcommittee noted that CDK4/6 inhibitors reduce cellular proliferation\u00a0by blocking progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, promoting transient, and\u00a0possibly permanent, proliferative arrest.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is approved for the treatment of HR-positive/HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with\u00a0an aromatase inhibitor, and in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received\u00a0prior endocrine therapy.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application submitted by the supplier was for\u00a0consideration of funding for palbociclib as an initial (first-line) endocrine agent only and\u00a0did not appear to include its use in combination with fulvestrant as a second-line endocrine\u00a0agent.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the recommended dose of palbociclib is 125 mg once daily\u00a0for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment, and that treatment should be\u00a0continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the applicant identified two clinical trials that provide the\u00a0key evidence for palbociclib for the treatment of HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced\u00a0breast cancer: the phase 2 PALOMA-1 trial and the phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the open-label, randomized, phase 2 PALOMA-1 trial which\u00a0investigated the safety and efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole compared\u00a0with letrozole alone as first-line treatment in 165 postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524798\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the objective response rates were 43% in the\u00a0palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared with 33% in the letrozole alone arm (P=0.13), and\u00a0that the clinical benefit rate was 81% compared with 58% (P=0.0009), respectively. The\u00a0Subcommittee noted that the median duration of response for patients who achieved a\u00a0complete or partial response was 20.3 months in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm\u00a0compared with 11.1 months in the letrozole alone arm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the median overall survival (OS) at the time of the primary\u00a0analysis of the PALOMA-1 trial was 37.5 months in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm\u00a0compared with 33.2 months in the letrozole alone arm (HR 0.813, 95% CI 0.492, 1.345;\u00a0P=0.42).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the rates of anaemia, nausea, arthralgia, and alopecia in\u00a0PALOMA-1 were higher in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared with the letrozole\u00a0alone arm. The Subcommittee noted that 33% of patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole\u00a0arm had dose interruptions due to an adverse event compared with 4% of patients in the\u00a0letrozole alone arm, and that 40% of patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole had a\u00a0dose reduction. The Subcommittee noted that 13% of patients in the palbociclib plus\u00a0letrozole arm discontinued treatment due to an adverse event compared with 2% of\u00a0patients in the letrozole alone arm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the updated analysis of PALOMA-1 published in abstract\u00a0form, which identified a median OS of 37.5 months in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm\u00a0compared with 34.5 months in the letrozole alone arm (HR 0.897; 95% CI 0.623, 1.294;\u00a0P=0.281) (<a href=\"http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.1001\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al.

Curr Med Res Opin. 2016;35:959-65</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a PFS benefit in patients who received palbociclib plus\u00a0letrozole was observed across the majority of subgroups (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349747\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al. Breast Cancer Res.\u00a02016;18:67</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3\u00a0PALOMA-2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of palbociclib plus letrozole\u00a0compared with placebo plus letrozole in 666 postmenopausal women with oestrogen\u00a0receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior\u00a0systemic treatment for advanced disease <a href=\"http://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613\" target=\"_blank\">(</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al N Engl J Med. 2016;375:1925-1936</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the study design and patient demographics of the PALOMA-2\u00a0trial. The Subcommittee noted that 49% of patients had visceral disease at baseline, 48%\u00a0of patients had received prior chemotherapy, and 21% of patients had received prior\u00a0treatment with anastrozole or letrozole.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, after a median follow-up of 23 months, that the median\u00a0investigator-assessed PFS (primary endpoint), in the PALOMA-2 trial was 24.8 months in\u00a0the palbociclib arm compared with 14.5 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46,\u00a00.72; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the objective response rates were 55.3%\u00a0in the palbociclib arm compared with 44.4% in the placebo arm (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.05,\u00a02.28; P=0.03), and that the clinical benefit rate was 84.3% compared with 70.8% (OR\u00a02.23; 95% CI, 1.39, 3.56; P&lt;0.001), respectively. The Subcommittee noted that the\u00a0median duration of response for patients who achieved a complete or partial response\u00a0was 22.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 16.8 months in the placebo arm.\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the OS data were immature at the time of the primary\u00a0analysis.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the rates of anaemia, haematological adverse events,\u00a0alopecia, diarrhoea, and stomatitis in PALOMA-2 were higher in the palbociclib arm\u00a0compared with the placebo arm. The Subcommittee noted that any grade neutropenia\u00a0was reported for 79.5% of patients in the palbociclib arm, but that grade 3 or 4 febrile\u00a0neutropenia was reported in only 1.8% of patients. The Subcommittee noted that 36.0%\u00a0of patients in the palbociclib arm had dose reductions compared with 1.4% in the placebo\u00a0arm, and that 9.4% of patients in the palbociclib arm discontinued due to adverse events\u00a0compared with 1.4% of patients in the placebo arm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if palbociclib were funded, this would likely result in\u00a0additional hospital visits related to toxicity and additional blood tests for neutropenia may\u00a0also be required; in the absence of significant toxicity and neutropenia, patients would\u00a0likely undergo regular follow-ups every 6-months.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the quality-of-life (QoL) results of PALOMA-2, which identified\u00a0that the addition of palbociclib to letrozole delayed deterioration in health-related QoL\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360932\" target=\"_blank\">Rugo et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:888-894</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the open-label, randomised, phase 2 TREnd trial which\u00a0investigated the clinical activity of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy or\u00a0palbociclib alone in 115 postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative\u00a0advanced breast cancer who have progressed on previous endocrine therapy (<a href=\"http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.1002\" target=\"_blank\">Malorni et\u00a0al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:1002-1002</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS was\u00a010.8 months in patients receiving palbociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 6.5\u00a0months in patients receiving palbociclib alone. The Subcommittee considered that this\u00a0indicates that palbociclib may have clinical activity in patients who have previously\u00a0received endocrine therapy; however, these results are exploratory at this stage.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomised, phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which\u00a0investigated the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant compared with\u00a0placebo plus fulvestrant in 521 women with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer\u00a0who had relapsed during prior endocrine therapy <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030518\" target=\"_blank\">(Turner et al. N Engl J Med.\u00a02015;373:209-219</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the patient population included premenopausal/ perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and that the former\u00a0received goserelin for the duration of the study.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial demonstrated that\u00a0palbociclib combined with fulvestrant appeared to provide a PFS benefit compared with\u00a0fulvestrant alone in patients who had received prior endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee\u00a0noted that overall survival data were immature at the time of interim analysis. The\u00a0Subcommittee considered that based on currently available evidence it appeared there\u00a0was a lower level of benefit from use of palbociclib in a second-line setting as compared\u00a0to as a first-line endocrine therapy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomized, phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial,\u00a0which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in\u00a0premenopausal women with advanced HR-positive breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902\" target=\"_blank\">Tripathy et al. Lancet\u00a0Oncol. 2018;19:904-915</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ribociclib is another CDK4/6\u00a0inhibitor, and that the results of MONALEESA supported that ribociclib plus endocrine\u00a0therapy improved PFS compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were other CDK4/6 inhibitors in late-stage\u00a0development and considered that, based on the currently available evidence, there\u00a0appeared to be a class effect in terms of similar response rates and improved PFS from\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR-positive breast cancer. The Subcommittee noted it was interested\u00a0to review further CDK4/6 data as it became available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that survival data for all agents under development appeared\u00a0not to be powered for OS; however, the Subcommittee considered that PFS is an\u00a0adequate endpoint in this population, and noted the findings of a recent report published\u00a0by The National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Steering Committee which identified that\u00a0PFS is the preferred endpoint for trials investigating first- or second-line treatment for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30212295/\" target=\"_blank\">Seidman et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;JCO1800242</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the eligibility criteria for PALOMA 2 required women to be\u00a0postmenopausal, defined by having undergone prior bilateral oophorectomy,\u00a0spontaneous cessation of menses for 12 consecutive months or more, or having follicle-stimulating hormone and oestradiol levels in postmenopausal ranges without an\u00a0alternative cause. The Subcommittee noted that this excluded patients rendered\u00a0postmenopausal through the use of luteinizing-hormone-release hormone (LHRH)\u00a0agonists. The Subcommittee considered that these patients also have the potential to\u00a0benefit from treatment with palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and\u00a0considered that the evidence provided by the PALOMA-3 trial (which included\u00a0pre/perimenopausal patients receiving goserelin) supports this. The Subcommittee\u00a0considered that patients rendered postmenopausal through the use of LHRH agonists\u00a0should be included in the Special Authority criteria based on extrapolation of the\u00a0PALOMA-3 data. Members considered that an additional 10-15% of patients may undergo\u00a0this type of hormonal manipulation with LHRH agonists to access palbociclib, however\u00a0given the demographics of the breast cancer population this would likely be limited to only\u00a0younger patients with high risk disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated\u00a0the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in the second-line, were\u00a0promising however, considered the data is currently immature and should be reviewed\u00a0once mature published data becomes available. The Subcommittee considered that, while\u00a0fulvestrant was not currently funded in New Zealand, if fulvestrant were to be Medsafe\u00a0approved and both agents were listed on the Schedule, that the Special Authority criteria\u00a0for palbociclib should be reconsidered.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib was adversely\u00a0affected by the relatively high price being sought by the supplier.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that overall there was reasonable evidence of a modest\u00a0effect from the use of palbociclib in combination with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor\u00a0as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative\u00a0locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted there was also an improvement in pain from baseline\u00a0in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant group\u00a0(-3.3 vs 2.0; P=0.0011). The Committee noted there were no between-arm differences\u00a0in breast-cancer specific quality of life functional domains or breast or arm symptoms as\u00a0measured using the EORTC QLQ-BR23 instrument; and that there was a delay in\u00a0deterioration in global QoL in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with the\u00a0placebo plus fulvestrant group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee agreed with CaTSoP\u2019s conclusion that there is a significant health need\u00a0for women with previously treated HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC, and that PALOMA-3 provides good quality evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides\u00a0a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General\u00a0</u></i></p><p>The Committee noted the findings of three meta-analyses which investigated the\u00a0benefits and risks associated with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054831\" target=\"_blank\">Messina et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2018;172:9-21</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941621\" target=\"_blank\">Guo et al.

The Committee considered that these meta-analyses, in addition to\u00a0the Committee\u2019s review of the primary clinical trials of palbociclib and ribociclib, indicate\u00a0that there is a class effect with the CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that the agents within this\u00a0class can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic effect.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in April 2019, CaTSoP reviewed the evidence available to\u00a0date for the use of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib for the treatment of aBC\u00a0(publication of minutes pending). The Committee noted that based on this CaTSoP\u00a0considered there is a class effect with CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that there is likely to be no\u00a0significant difference in which endocrine partner the CDK4/6 inhibitors are combined\u00a0with.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available at this time regarding switching\u00a0between CDK4/6 inhibitors or continuing the same CDK4/6 inhibitor but switching the\u00a0endocrine partner at progression. The Committee noted that the PACE trial\u00a0(NCT03147287) and the TRINITI trial (NCT02732119) which are investigating the use\u00a0of CDK4/6 inhibitors following prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment are currently underway.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are a large number of trials underway investigating\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, including in different breast cancer subtypes, as\u00a0different treatment combinations, and for the treatment of different stages of breast\u00a0cancer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that there are a number of pharmacoeconomic analyses published\u00a0regarding the cost effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603995\" target=\"_blank\">Gogate et al.

The Committee\u00a0noted that these studies generally concluded that CDK4/6 inhibitors exceed willingness\u00a0to pay thresholds at the prices currently being offered. The Committee noted that the\u00a0pharmacoeconomic analyses that compared the cost effectiveness of ribociclib to\u00a0palbociclib found that ribociclib was a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib, noting that\u00a0these analyses are largely driven by the price offered in the country they were conducted\u00a0in (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799329\" target=\"_blank\">Mistry et al.

Breast Cancer Res Treat.\u00a02018;172:9-21</a>).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered there is limited evidence available at this time to definitively\u00a0demonstrate which endocrine partner should be used in combination with a CDK4/6\u00a0inhibitor. The Committee considered that the majority of the evidence regarding first-line\u00a0treatment indicates that an AI is the most appropriate endocrine partner in this setting.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the majority of the data available regarding second-line\u00a0treatment has been conducted in combination with fulvestrant, but considered that the\u00a0evidence for the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors was relatively early in its development and the\u00a0Committee could support the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with other\u00a0endocrine partners if evidence supporting this became available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is an increased frequency of grade 3/4 neutropenia and\u00a0leukopenia with CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, but that this does not appear to affect QoL\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360932\" target=\"_blank\">Rugo et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:888-94</a>). The Committee noted that if a CDK4/6 inhibitor\u00a0were funded, there may be an increased requirement for the investigation and treatment\u00a0of neutropenia and so additional associated costs to the sector from this.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited OS data currently available for the use of\u00a0first line CDK4/6 inhibitors, and the OS data available to date for second line use of\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant difference compared with\u00a0placebo. The Committee noted CaTSoP\u2019s April 2019 discussion of the difficulties in\u00a0assessing OS in disease such as HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer where\u00a0patients have long survival times and receive multiple lines of treatment (CaTSoP April\u00a02019 - publication of minutes pending).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee noted that palbociclib plus fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of\u00a0HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC has a score of 4 on the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical\u00a0Benefit Scale; palbociclib or ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the first-line\u00a0treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC have scores of 3 on the ESMO-Magnitude\u00a0of Clinical Benefit Scale.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee considered that there is moderate quality evidence that palbociclib or\u00a0ribociclib used in combination with an endocrine partner as a first-line treatment provides\u00a0a modest improvement in PFS and maintains QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC. The Committee considered that while there are good quality Phase 3\u00a0randomized controlled trials available, that the interpretation of results is limited by the\u00a0</p><p>emphasis placed on PFS. The Committee considered that a composite analysis of PFS,\u00a0OS, safety, and QoL data would strengthen the evidence base.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is good quality evidence that palbociclib in\u00a0combination with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment provides a modest improvement\u00a0in PFS with maintenance of QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was uncertain whether the use of a CDK4/6 in a first or second-line setting would provide greater overall benefit for patients, as there was a\u00a0lack of evidence to inform whether these agents altered tumour biology and/or the\u00a0efficacy of subsequent treatments. The Committee considered it was likely that the use\u00a0of a CDK4/6 inhibitor would alter prescriber behaviour for later line treatments.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that patients who have already progressed following one line\u00a0of endocrine therapy have a higher health need than those who are treatment na\u00efve due\u00a0to a lack of alternative treatment options.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Special Authority criteria previously recommended\u00a0by CaTSoP for the first- and second-line use of CDK4/6 inhibitors are appropriate.\u00a0</p>",

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting. Although, members noted that this does not include those second-line patients with hormone sensitive disease where the data in this subgroup is considered to be stronger than in a general second-line population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated survival data for ribociclib from MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 reinforced the signal of a class effect from use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that benefit from use of CDK4/6 inhibitor has been demonstrated across both first and second-line populations. The Subcommittee considered that the differences in trial results is likely to have been driven by heterogeneity of the trial populations, such as the number of patients with endocrine-sensitive disease or ESR-1 mutation rates, although this was based on expert opinion and not supported by any current data.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a benefit from CDK4/6 inhibitors is reported in both first-line post-menopausal patients and first-line pre-menopausal patients treated with ovarian suppression with the strength of evidence best for those who receive aromatase inhibitor and goserelin. The Subcommittee considered that patients with hormone-sensitive disease appear to get the most benefit from use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a second-line setting; and that the durability of response for the overall second-line population is likely to be slightly shorter than when used in a first-line HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the various trials for use of the three CDK4/6 inhibitor agents with currently published evidence, the ribociclib trials were of highest quality due to their clinical trial design, which meant that OS could be demonstrated, whereas the survival data from the palbociclib and abemaciclib trials were compromised by the crossover design.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is good quality evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a PFS of around 10 to 12 months and around a 30% improvement in OS (in a disease setting where it is difficult to demonstrate OS gain) both of which were clinically meaningful for patients with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while improving OS is considered the most important therapeutic goal in advanced breast cancer, it has been difficult to demonstrate an OS advantage in clinical trials in advanced breast cancer populations and particularly in a first-line setting. The Subcommittee considered this is both because powering studies to show OS requires very large patient numbers and also because heterogeneous populations with long post progression survival, crossover and heterogeneous post study therapy as well as the evolving treatment standards for these patients all impact on study outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had considered some of the issues and challenges related to clinical trial design, surrogate outcomes and critical appraisal at its meeting in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in advanced breast cancer there is evidence to support the use of surrogate measure, such as PFS, for OS including a number of systematic reviews across a variety of advanced breast cancer patient populations. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee acknowledged that the quality of these reviews was variable (the number of trials included in these reviews and the number of patients in the trials included differed, some reviews use all lines of therapy whereas some restrict to first or second line) almost all of these reviews addressed the issue of PFS as a surrogate measure for OS in metastatic disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some reviews did not show any correlation between PFS and OS while other showed a modest correlation (square correlation statistic ranged from 0.1-0.57), however considered that the more tightly the population was defined the better the correlation became for example HR-positive, HER2-negative disease in premenopausal women.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted a<span style=\"color: black;\"> study of mBC patients and oncology care providers (</span>nurses<span style=\"color: black;\"> and oncologists) in the US aimed at evaluating by the value of OS, PFS, and other treatment attributes in treatment decision by surveys designed to assess preferences for OS/PFS and stable disease and the timing thereof, preferences for level of evidence and toxicity rates as well as willingness to pay for specific treatment attributes (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589981/\" target=\"_blank\">MacEwan et al MDM Policy Pract. 2019; 4: 2381468319855386</a><span style=\"color: black;\">).</span></p><p>General comments</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that on 1 September 2019, PHARMAC issued a <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/rfp-2019-09-01-cdk4-cdk6/\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Proposals</a> for the supply of a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and that this process was seeking commercial bids from the suppliers of these medicines for use as both first and second-line treatment for patients who meet the Special Authority criteria detailed in the RFP document (as recommended by CaTSoP in April 2019).

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting.

The Subcommittee considered that patients with hormone-sensitive disease appear to get the most benefit from use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a second-line setting; and that the durability of response for the overall second-line population is likely to be slightly shorter than when used in a first-line HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the various trials for use of the three CDK4/6 inhibitor agents with currently published evidence, the ribociclib trials were of highest quality due to their clinical trial design, which meant that OS could be demonstrated, whereas the survival data from the palbociclib and abemaciclib trials were compromised by the crossover design.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is good quality evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a PFS of around 10 to 12 months and around a 30% improvement in OS (in a disease setting where it is difficult to demonstrate OS gain) both of which were clinically meaningful for patients with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while improving OS is considered the most important therapeutic goal in advanced breast cancer, it has been difficult to demonstrate an OS advantage in clinical trials in advanced breast cancer populations and particularly in a first-line setting.

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting. Although, members noted that this does not include those second-line patients with hormone sensitive disease where the data in this subgroup is considered to be stronger than in a general second-line population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated survival data for ribociclib from MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 reinforced the signal of a class effect from use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that benefit from use of CDK4/6 inhibitor has been demonstrated across both first and second-line populations. The Subcommittee considered that the differences in trial results is likely to have been driven by heterogeneity of the trial populations, such as the number of patients with endocrine-sensitive disease or ESR-1 mutation rates, although this was based on expert opinion and not supported by any current data.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a benefit from CDK4/6 inhibitors is reported in both first-line post-menopausal patients and first-line pre-menopausal patients treated with ovarian suppression with the strength of evidence best for those who receive aromatase inhibitor and goserelin. The Subcommittee considered that patients with hormone-sensitive disease appear to get the most benefit from use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a second-line setting; and that the durability of response for the overall second-line population is likely to be slightly shorter than when used in a first-line HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the various trials for use of the three CDK4/6 inhibitor agents with currently published evidence, the ribociclib trials were of highest quality due to their clinical trial design, which meant that OS could be demonstrated, whereas the survival data from the palbociclib and abemaciclib trials were compromised by the crossover design.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is good quality evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a PFS of around 10 to 12 months and around a 30% improvement in OS (in a disease setting where it is difficult to demonstrate OS gain) both of which were clinically meaningful for patients with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while improving OS is considered the most important therapeutic goal in advanced breast cancer, it has been difficult to demonstrate an OS advantage in clinical trials in advanced breast cancer populations and particularly in a first-line setting. The Subcommittee considered this is both because powering studies to show OS requires very large patient numbers and also because heterogeneous populations with long post progression survival, crossover and heterogeneous post study therapy as well as the evolving treatment standards for these patients all impact on study outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had considered some of the issues and challenges related to clinical trial design, surrogate outcomes and critical appraisal at its meeting in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in advanced breast cancer there is evidence to support the use of surrogate measure, such as PFS, for OS including a number of systematic reviews across a variety of advanced breast cancer patient populations. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee acknowledged that the quality of these reviews was variable (the number of trials included in these reviews and the number of patients in the trials included differed, some reviews use all lines of therapy whereas some restrict to first or second line) almost all of these reviews addressed the issue of PFS as a surrogate measure for OS in metastatic disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some reviews did not show any correlation between PFS and OS while other showed a modest correlation (square correlation statistic ranged from 0.1-0.57), however considered that the more tightly the population was defined the better the correlation became for example HR-positive, HER2-negative disease in premenopausal women.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted a<span style=\"color: black;\"> study of mBC patients and oncology care providers (</span>nurses<span style=\"color: black;\"> and oncologists) in the US aimed at evaluating by the value of OS, PFS, and other treatment attributes in treatment decision by surveys designed to assess preferences for OS/PFS and stable disease and the timing thereof, preferences for level of evidence and toxicity rates as well as willingness to pay for specific treatment attributes (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589981/\" target=\"_blank\">MacEwan et al MDM Policy Pract. 2019; 4: 2381468319855386</a><span style=\"color: black;\">).</span></p><p>General comments</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that on 1 September 2019, PHARMAC issued a <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/rfp-2019-09-01-cdk4-cdk6/\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Proposals</a> for the supply of a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and that this process was seeking commercial bids from the suppliers of these medicines for use as both first and second-line treatment for patients who meet the Special Authority criteria detailed in the RFP document (as recommended by CaTSoP in April 2019). The Subcommittee considered it would be a preferred outcome for both first and second-line populations to be funded as a result of this competitive process.</p>",
