2,"<p>Following Clinical Advice, Pharmac staff considers the advice and the funding application under goes an assessment using our&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/factors-for-consideration/"" rel=""nofollow"">Factors for Consideration</a>&nbsp;framework and seeks additional information as required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information on the purpose of, and techniques for, undertaking economic analysis in health care, please refer&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/economic-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/economic-analysis/</a></p>",2,Under Assessment,False,,,False,False
3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee when or if a ranked medicine will be funded.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/prioritisation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/prioritisation/</a></p>",3,Options Compared,False,,,False,False
