The Subcommittee noted that the analysis included the Brief Pain Inventory\xa0–\xa0Short Form, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate scale (FACT-P), and the EuroQoL questionnaire. The Subcommittee noted that adherence was 90% or higher for all patient reported outcome measurement tools. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to deterioration of functional status according to FACT-P was 12.9 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 8.3 months in the placebo group (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; <i>P</i>=0.032).

N Engl J Med. 2017;377:338-51</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ARM G contained four groups of patients: 50% of patients were those with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 20% were men with newly diagnosed node positive but not otherwise metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 27% were those with newly diagnosed but node negative high risk locally advanced prostate cancer (high risk defined as T3,4 disease; Gleason 8 – 10, PSA ≥ 40 nG/mL); and a final group of men previously treated with radical surgery or brachytherapy no longer receiving therapy and newly relapsing with high risk features and that this was the smallest group (&lt;5% in both arms).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that for the whole study population the 3-year survival was 83% in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm (Arm G), compared with 76% in the ADT-alone arm (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.76; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that failure free survival time in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm was 43.9 months, compared with 30.0 months in the ADT-alone arm, that the 3-year progression-free survival was 80% compared with 62% (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and that the 3-year rate without symptomatic skeletal events was 88% compared with 78% (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that among the 1476 patients in the safety population in the relevant sub-analysis of STAMPEDE in whom progression had not occurred within the first year, the prevalence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 15% among patients who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT, compared with 11% in the ADT alone group.

The Subcommittee noted that Feyerabend et al (2018) reported that abiraterone plus prednisone and ADT is at least as effective in reducing the risk of death as docetaxel plus ADT; and was reportedly better at preventing disease progression and improving quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that Wallis et al (2018) reported that there was no significant difference in overall survival between abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT and docetaxel plus ADT. The Subcommittee noted that Vale et al (2018) reported that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone appears to be the most effective treatment, although considered it was not clear whether this is due to an increased benefit or variation in the trials included. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a direct, randomised comparison of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT with docetaxel plus ADT was conducted as part of the STAMPEDE trial (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961425/"" target=""_blank"">Sydes et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1235-1248</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was not a formally powered comparison. The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 4 years, there were 44/189 (23%) deaths in the docetaxel arm and 105/377 (28%) deaths in the abiraterone acetate arm (all patients: overall survival HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.65; patients with metastatic disease: overall survival HR=1.13; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that guidelines from NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT are appropriate for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive disease who are fit enough to receive these agents.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that metastatic prostate cancer in New Zealand is primarily diagnosed by a positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI, and that these were the criteria used for eligibility in the LATITUDE trial. The Subcommittee noted that gallium-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (PSMA) PET imaging is a diagnostic tool available privately in New Zealand that has better specificity and sensitivity than standard imaging modalities for detecting metastatic prostate cancer. The Subcommittee considered that there is pressure to more widely introduce PSMA PET technology, and that this has potential consequences for equity due to variable access as patients who are able to access PSMA-PET could qualify for treatment earlier in their disease course. The Subcommittee also considered that it is unclear at this time whether metastatic disease diagnosed using PSMA PET imaging is comparable with metastatic disease diagnosed using conventional imaging modalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted PTAC’s recommendation that abiraterone acetate, for use in combination with prednisone and ADT in a wider group of patients than those meeting the eligibility criteria for the LATITUDE trial, be deferred until additional data in these settings is available. The Subcommittee considered that the data from the STAMPEDE trial suggests that there is potential for abiraterone acetate to have health benefits in a population wider than that described by LATITUDE, but agreed that this evidence is not yet mature enough to make a positive recommendation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the existing Special Authority criteria for abiraterone acetate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer stipulates that where patients are previously treated with chemotherapy containing a taxane they must have had prior treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone were funded for newly diagnosed castrate sensitive or hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer, that this criterion should not be changed. However, the Subcommittee considered that amendment should be made to preclude prior abiraterone treatment for patients who have not received prior taxane chemotherapy. The Subcommittee considered that patients should be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate only once, either for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC or for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, as there is a lack of evidence to support a further line of abiraterone treatment following relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC that there would likely be a decrease in the use of docetaxel and bicalutamide. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC subject to the eligibility criteria in LATITUDE, that the patient number estimates provided by the supplier were reasonable (n = 113 in year 1, increasing to n\xa0=\xa0520 in year 5). The Subcommittee considered that uptake of abiraterone acetate in these populations would be high as there would likely be a preference for abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT over ADT and docetaxel. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate, in combination with prednisone and ADT, for the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC provided by LATITUDE, was of moderate to high quality, and that there is a need for an alternative treatment option for these patients.

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
