The Committee noted that the Anti-Infective Subcommittee recommended bedaquiline be funded with a high priority for the treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health MDR-TB Committee at its December 2014 meeting. The Committee noted that both the Anti-Infective Subcommittee and the Rare Disorders Subcommittee noted the unexplained increased mortality in the bedaquiline group in the phase-II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial by Diacon et al (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140958"" target=""_blank"">N Eng J Med. 2014;371:723-32</a>).

The Committee noted the rate of treatment failure was lower in patients receiving bedaquiline (11.6%) compared with those who did not (48.8%). The Committee noted that treatment failure would require further treatment with other toxic medications and result in patient seclusion/isolation for longer duration of time, especially in regions without infection control isolation facilities with adequate negative pressure etc. The Committee noted that fewer deaths were observed with those taking bedaquiline (15%) when compared with those not taking bedaquiline (22.8%). </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results from a phase-II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial with 208 participants to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of bedaquiline as part of a combination therapy of MDR-TB (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140958"" target=""_blank"">Diacon et al, N Eng J Med. 2014;371:723-32</a>).

The Committee noted the proportion of patients in the bedaquiline group with confirmed culture conversion at weeks 24 in C209 (79.5%) was similar to that of C208 (72.2%). The Committee also noted the higher rates of cure observed in the bedaquiline group (61%) compared with the placebo group (57.6%). The Committee noted that none of the deaths observed in the bedaquiline group appeared directly related to bedaquiline; reported causes of death included tuberculosis-related illness, haemoptysis, renal impairment, respiratory failure, congestive cardiac failure, and hypertension.\xa0\xa0\xa0</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results from a meta-analysis based on pooled data from five cohorts of 537 patients treated with bedaquiline in France, Georgia, Armenia, and South Africa (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478224/"" target=""_blank"">Lawrence et al, Emerg Infect Dis. 2019 May; 25(5): 936–943</a>). The Committee noted positive results for rate of culture conversion at 6 months (78%), treatment success (65.8%) and death (11.7%). The Committee also noted that the results were positive despite many patients suffering from “cavitating diseases” such as HIV (120 patients) and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (77 patients). </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence for bedaquiline as part of MDR-TB treatment regime: </p><p>1.11.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Compassionate use of bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: interim analysis of a French cohort (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320286"" target=""_blank"">Guglielmetti et al.

Bedaquiline-containing regimens were given to 743 (4.0%) patients with MDR-TB or RR-TB. Of the 1016 patients who received bedaquiline, 128 died (12.6%); the Committee noted that 4,612 deaths (24.8%) occurred among 18,601 patients on the standard regimens. Bedaquiline was therefore associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0·28–0·46) compared with standard regimens.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted one randomised controlled trial submitted by the applicant, but that several non-randomised studies have supported the evidence for bedaquiline as part of individualised multidrug MDR-TB treatment regimen. The Committee noted that in order to comply with the latest guidelines from the World Health Organization, bedaquiline would need to be made available for the treatment of MDR-TB. </p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the use of amikacin, one of the second-line anti-tuberculosis agents, as an alternative to bedaquiline. The Committee considered that although this Group C agent has comparable efficacy to Group A agents, amikacin has an unfavourable toxicity profile, being associated with renal impairment, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. </p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the cardiovascular toxicity profile of bedaquiline, noting that it prolongs the QT interval, especially in combination with moxifloxacin. The Committee noted that very few people stop bedaquiline due to cardiotoxicity, although patients may switch from moxifloxacin to levofloxacin to reduce the combined effect on QT interval. The Committee noted that all patients on bedaquiline would require ECG and serum electrolyte monitoring in line with established guidelines. </p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that bedaquiline results in a more rapid culture conversion compared with other agents, and this in turn would reduce the isolation time required in hospital i.e. being infected with a difficult to treat fatal organism prior to culture conversion. The Committee considered bedaquiline may also lessen the risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other members of the community, where generally patients could be treated in outpatient and community settings. The Committee noted that bedaquiline enables outpatient oral treatment for extrapulmonary TB and pulmonary TB that is no longer infectious.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there would be positive health outcomes and reductions in total healthcare costs by adding bedaquiline to current treatment regimens.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
</ul>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>

<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
