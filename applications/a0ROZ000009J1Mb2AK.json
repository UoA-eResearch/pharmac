The Subcommittee noted that the Guardian 3 system consists of the Guardian Sensor (3) glucose sensor, the Guardian Connect transmitter and the Guardian Connect application (app). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the Guardian Link transmitter receives and sends data to the Guardian Connect app through a Bluetooth Smart wireless connection and that the app can be downloaded onto any mobile device with a compatible operating system version. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the Guardian Sensors work for up to 7 days and can be placed on a patient\u2019s abdomen or on the back of the arm. The Subcommittee noted that the transmitter can be worn for up to 7 days at a time without recharging and have a 12-month lifespan. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the Guardian 3 system, can pair with both currently Pharmac-funded Medtronic pumps (the MiniMed 640G and the MiniMed 770G). The Subcommittee noted that when paired with the MiniMed 640 users can utilise a predictive low glucose suspension function, while the MiniMed 770G offers greater closed-loop functionality through automatic basal insulin adjustment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that glucose readings are updated every five minutes to the patients pump screen or the user\u2019s smart device via the MiniMed application. The Subcommittee noted that CGM alerts notify the individual of high and low glucose values, and graphs and trend arrows show the speed and direction glucose levels are moving. The Subcommittee noted that the CGM system has an in-built hypoglycaemia threshold for alarm which can be adjusted by users.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the Medtronic Guardian 3 glucose sensor and transmitter are registered on the Web Assisted Notification of Devices (WAND) database, which is a mandatory requirement for importers, exporters, and local manufacturers (Glucose Sensor WAND reference: 071010-WAND-77484E, Glucose Transmitter WAND reference: 071010-WAND-77U8G8). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that unlike the Dexcom G6 CGM system, the Medtronic Guardian 3 system requires frequent calibration (up to four times per day) with finger-prick testing for reliable performance. The Subcommittee considers that frequent calibration is a significant driver of patient disengagement.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following studies provided by the supplier in the<span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"> a</span>pplication for funding: </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Bergenstal et al.
