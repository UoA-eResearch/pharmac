          "s": "<p><i>General comments regarding type 1 diabetes</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease resulting from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells resulting in insulin deficiency. <span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee noted that individuals with type 1 diabetes use exogenous insulin to manage blood glucose levels but that maintaining a normal range requires a significant mental energy and can lead to diabetes-related fatigue. The Subcommittee noted that sustained fatigue can lead to burnout and poor glycaemic control.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a recent epidemiological study conducted by <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/hc/pdf/HC20067\" target=\"_blank\">Chepulis et al. (2021)</a> which recently estimated that the population prevalence of type 1 diabetes to be approximately 0.4% of the population, equating to 20,000 New Zealanders. The Subcommittee noted that another study conducted by <a href=\"https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/district-health-board-of-residence-ethnicity-and-socioeconomic-status-all-impact-publicly-funded-insulin-pump-uptake-in-new-zealand-patients-with-type-1-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">Wheeler et al. (2019)</a> which, utilising a hospital admissions and dispensing data, estimated the prevalence of type 1 diabetes to be 17,338 people between <span style=\"color: black;\">1 September 2012 and 31 December 2016.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the current standard of care for glucose monitoring <span style=\"color: black;\">is self-monitoring via a finger-prick blood test with or without the addition of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an insulin pump. The</span> <span style=\"color: black;\">Subcommittee noted that patients with good glycaemic control are typically testing on average between four and ten times per day and considered that adherence to this regimen could be challenging especially for children and young adults, as it involves maintaining a careful balance of insulin dosing, dietary intake, and exercise. The Subcommittee noted that many patients seldom test their blood glucose, but rather approximate their bolus insulin dosing to food intake and rely on a minimum viable dose of basal insulin. </span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that type 1 diabetes has a significant negative impact on quality of life for affected individuals, particularly regarding physical functioning and wellbeing. The Subcommittee noted that glycaemic variability and sustained poor glycaemic control can lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as diabetic ketoacidosis and death.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the perpetual fear of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, as well as the fear of long-term complications, can result in significant stress and anxiety.<span style=\"color: black;\"> </span>Furthermore, the Subcommittee noted that there is also a significant impact on the family and caregivers of individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while the incidence of type 1 diabetes is lower in M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, they are disproportionately represented in hospital admissions data for diabetic ketoacidosis and suffer significantly poorer outcomes than other patient populations. The Subcommittee noted that a study by Carter et al. (2008) reported that lower SES and ethnicity were independent predictors of poor glycaemic control in children with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>General Comments Regarding CGM and FGM</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that diagnostic blood glucose test meters and strips are funded for patients meeting certain eligibility criteria, including individuals receiving insulin and that there are currently no flash or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems funded for use within New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that it had previously recommended the Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system for funding with a high priority. The Subcommittee noted that FGM systems permits manual sensor augmented multiple daily insulin (MDI) dosing with better data, but not the advantage of advanced features of insulin pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems utilise sensor electrodes inserted into the subcutaneous tissue (usually on the abdomen), to measure glucose in the interstitial fluid, which is then converted into an electronic signal and transmitted via a low energy Bluetooth signal (range in the air about 6 meters) to either a reader or smart device where it is displayed for the user as a glucose reading.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are functional distinctions between CGM and FGM, namely that CGM systems include a transmitter that automatically transmits a continuous stream of real-time numerical and graphical information about the current glucose level and velocity of change to the user\u2019s optional receiver or smartphone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while current FGM systems do provide glucose level trend arrows to encourage closer monitoring or intervention, they tend to be user-initiated and typically require the sensor to be manually scanned with a reader device. The Subcommittee considered that the major limitation of FGM systems is that they not designed to be integrated with insulin pumps or provide alarm features for either predicted nor actual hypoglycaemia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can be used as a stand-alone monitoring device to guide insulin delivery or paired with an insulin pump as an integrated pump system with advanced features such as predictive low glucose suspend and bolus autocorrections. The Subcommittee considered integrated pump therapy to be a significant improvement from the status quo for people with type 1 diabetes, which is either capillary glucose informed MDI or capillary glucose informed pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that integrated pump systems vary significantly in their functionality based on the software used to pair the devices. The Subcommittee considered there to be the following classes of integrated pump systems:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy: where there is little or no interoperability between the pump and the CGM system and the user must make data-informed decisions around basal settings and bolus dose calculations.</li><li>Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems: where an algorithm modulates basal insulin delivery with predictive-low glucose suspend of insulin delivery but does not give automated boluses.</li><li><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Advanced hybrid-closed loop (AHCL) systems: where an algorithm enables automated correction boluses, a meal detection module can let the system deliver more aggressive automated correction boluses and intensification of basal insulin delivery to consistently target near normal glycaemia.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can differ substantially in their accuracy, build-quality, calibration requirements, and closed-loop functionality. The Subcommittee considered that the field of glucose monitoring technologies was evolving rapidly and noted that funding applications for the Dexcom and Guardian CGM systems were the first to be referred to the Subcommittee for clinical advice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems are likely to improve the time spent in the target glycaemic range (TIR), reduce the time spent in hypoglycaemia, and reduce the number of hypoglycaemic events requiring medical attention when used with or without insulin pump therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that the major benefits were likely to accrue when paired with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee noted that this was particularly true of when the CGM is integrated with an insulin pump with advanced features such as sensor informed correction boluses and predictive low glucose suspend.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that these technologies would likely benefit all people with difficult to control diabetes with the evidence strongest for the use in the type 1 diabetes setting. The Subcommittee considered that patients with diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis and patients who have undergone a pancreatectomy, should be considered within the same grouping of \u2018people with diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy.\u2019</p><p><br></p><p>While the Subcommittee noted that there were benefits associated with CGM systems in place of finger-prick testing, the Subcommittee considered that these benefits may wane overtime, with some patients suffering from \u2018user fatigue\u2019 associated with the constant stream of information.\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that this was less likely to be the case if used in a hybrid closed loop system with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee considered that FGM informed MDI may be more suitable in people with type 1 diabetes who are not eligible for insulin pump therapy. The Subcommittee also noted that FGM sensors can be used for up to 14 days of use, almost twice the duration of many CGM systems.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that both FGM and CGM systems can be used on a temporary basis or intermittent basis for patients initiating multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens to enable insulin dose-titration. The Subcommittee noted that CGM data can also inform decisions around driving safety, particularly among those with hypoglycaemic unawareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems were most beneficial to patients with type 1 diabetes when paired with an insulin pump, but that there are people with type 1 diabetes who would benefit from these technologies who do not meet the current pump SA eligibility criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the pump criteria should be reviewed to identify patient subpopulations that would most benefit from the paired technologies but that there was a clear unmet health need in type 1 diabetes patients with severe unexplained hypoglycaemia and/or recurrent DKA in the first instance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were a number of equity considerations relating to the funding of CGM particularly regarding equity of access to the digital technologies (i.e. smart phones) required to utilise some CGM systems. The Subcommittee noted variable resourcing across DHBs to implement education and initiation of CGM technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems are widely available internationally and is subsidised in Australia (under the Australian National Diabetes Services Scheme) and in England by the NHS.

The</span> <span style=\"color: black;\">Subcommittee noted that patients with good glycaemic control are typically testing on average between four and ten times per day and considered that adherence to this regimen could be challenging especially for children and young adults, as it involves maintaining a careful balance of insulin dosing, dietary intake, and exercise. The Subcommittee noted that many patients seldom test their blood glucose, but rather approximate their bolus insulin dosing to food intake and rely on a minimum viable dose of basal insulin. </span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that type 1 diabetes has a significant negative impact on quality of life for affected individuals, particularly regarding physical functioning and wellbeing. The Subcommittee noted that glycaemic variability and sustained poor glycaemic control can lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as diabetic ketoacidosis and death.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the perpetual fear of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, as well as the fear of long-term complications, can result in significant stress and anxiety.<span style=\"color: black;\"> </span>Furthermore, the Subcommittee noted that there is also a significant impact on the family and caregivers of individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while the incidence of type 1 diabetes is lower in M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, they are disproportionately represented in hospital admissions data for diabetic ketoacidosis and suffer significantly poorer outcomes than other patient populations. The Subcommittee noted that a study by Carter et al. (2008) reported that lower SES and ethnicity were independent predictors of poor glycaemic control in children with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>General Comments Regarding CGM and FGM</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that diagnostic blood glucose test meters and strips are funded for patients meeting certain eligibility criteria, including individuals receiving insulin and that there are currently no flash or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems funded for use within New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that it had previously recommended the Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system for funding with a high priority. The Subcommittee noted that FGM systems permits manual sensor augmented multiple daily insulin (MDI) dosing with better data, but not the advantage of advanced features of insulin pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems utilise sensor electrodes inserted into the subcutaneous tissue (usually on the abdomen), to measure glucose in the interstitial fluid, which is then converted into an electronic signal and transmitted via a low energy Bluetooth signal (range in the air about 6 meters) to either a reader or smart device where it is displayed for the user as a glucose reading.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are functional distinctions between CGM and FGM, namely that CGM systems include a transmitter that automatically transmits a continuous stream of real-time numerical and graphical information about the current glucose level and velocity of change to the user\u2019s optional receiver or smartphone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while current FGM systems do provide glucose level trend arrows to encourage closer monitoring or intervention, they tend to be user-initiated and typically require the sensor to be manually scanned with a reader device. The Subcommittee considered that the major limitation of FGM systems is that they not designed to be integrated with insulin pumps or provide alarm features for either predicted nor actual hypoglycaemia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can be used as a stand-alone monitoring device to guide insulin delivery or paired with an insulin pump as an integrated pump system with advanced features such as predictive low glucose suspend and bolus autocorrections. The Subcommittee considered integrated pump therapy to be a significant improvement from the status quo for people with type 1 diabetes, which is either capillary glucose informed MDI or capillary glucose informed pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that integrated pump systems vary significantly in their functionality based on the software used to pair the devices. The Subcommittee considered there to be the following classes of integrated pump systems:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy: where there is little or no interoperability between the pump and the CGM system and the user must make data-informed decisions around basal settings and bolus dose calculations.</li><li>Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems: where an algorithm modulates basal insulin delivery with predictive-low glucose suspend of insulin delivery but does not give automated boluses.</li><li><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Advanced hybrid-closed loop (AHCL) systems: where an algorithm enables automated correction boluses, a meal detection module can let the system deliver more aggressive automated correction boluses and intensification of basal insulin delivery to consistently target near normal glycaemia.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can differ substantially in their accuracy, build-quality, calibration requirements, and closed-loop functionality. The Subcommittee considered that the field of glucose monitoring technologies was evolving rapidly and noted that funding applications for the Dexcom and Guardian CGM systems were the first to be referred to the Subcommittee for clinical advice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems are likely to improve the time spent in the target glycaemic range (TIR), reduce the time spent in hypoglycaemia, and reduce the number of hypoglycaemic events requiring medical attention when used with or without insulin pump therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that the major benefits were likely to accrue when paired with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee noted that this was particularly true of when the CGM is integrated with an insulin pump with advanced features such as sensor informed correction boluses and predictive low glucose suspend.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that these technologies would likely benefit all people with difficult to control diabetes with the evidence strongest for the use in the type 1 diabetes setting. The Subcommittee considered that patients with diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis and patients who have undergone a pancreatectomy, should be considered within the same grouping of \u2018people with diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy.\u2019</p><p><br></p><p>While the Subcommittee noted that there were benefits associated with CGM systems in place of finger-prick testing, the Subcommittee considered that these benefits may wane overtime, with some patients suffering from \u2018user fatigue\u2019 associated with the constant stream of information.\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that this was less likely to be the case if used in a hybrid closed loop system with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee considered that FGM informed MDI may be more suitable in people with type 1 diabetes who are not eligible for insulin pump therapy. The Subcommittee also noted that FGM sensors can be used for up to 14 days of use, almost twice the duration of many CGM systems.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that both FGM and CGM systems can be used on a temporary basis or intermittent basis for patients initiating multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens to enable insulin dose-titration. The Subcommittee noted that CGM data can also inform decisions around driving safety, particularly among those with hypoglycaemic unawareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems were most beneficial to patients with type 1 diabetes when paired with an insulin pump, but that there are people with type 1 diabetes who would benefit from these technologies who do not meet the current pump SA eligibility criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the pump criteria should be reviewed to identify patient subpopulations that would most benefit from the paired technologies but that there was a clear unmet health need in type 1 diabetes patients with severe unexplained hypoglycaemia and/or recurrent DKA in the first instance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were a number of equity considerations relating to the funding of CGM particularly regarding equity of access to the digital technologies (i.e. smart phones) required to utilise some CGM systems. The Subcommittee noted variable resourcing across DHBs to implement education and initiation of CGM technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems are widely available internationally and is subsidised in Australia (under the Australian National Diabetes Services Scheme) and in England by the NHS.

The Lancet. 2021. 397(10291):2275-2283</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after 6-months the CGM arm had a more favourable time in the target glycaemic range compared with the FGM arm (59\u00b76% vs 51\u00b79%; mean difference 6\u00b785 percentage points [95% CI 4\u00b736\u20139\u00b734]; P&lt;0\u00b70001).</li><li>IHART-CGM: an open-labelled trial of 40 adults with type 1 diabetes using an MDI regimen which randomised patients into CGM and FGM groups following 2 weeks of blinded CGM (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.13561\" target=\"_blank\">Reddy et al.

The Subcommittee noted that at the study endpoint the percentage of time spent in the hypoglycaemic range (&lt; 3.3 mmol/l) was 2.4%, and 6.8%, respectively (median between group difference \u22124.3%, P = 0.006).</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that both trials reported a small but marked improvement in glycaemic control (as measured by time in the target glycaemic range, HbA1c, and hypoglycaemic events) associated with use of CGM use when compared with FGM. The Subcommittee noted that the IHART-CGM extension reported a reduction in the percentage of time spent in the hypoglycaemic range over the 16-week extension (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1932296819867688\" target=\"_blank\">Avari et al.\u00a0Journal of diabetes science and technology. 2020.14(3):567-74)</a>, however, the Subcommittee considered that the extension period was still too short to validate the durability of response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the strongest evidence of benefit in terms of time in range and HbA1c was when the Dexcom G6 was paired with a matching pump and Control IQ in an AHCL system (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1907863\" target=\"_blank\">Brown et al. NEJM. 2019.381:1707-1717</a>). The Subcommittee noted that, compared with SAP therapy, AHCL led to time in range (TIR) improvements of approximately 11 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 14; P&lt;0.001) after 6 months. The Subcommittee noted that TIR results of around 70% were likely to have a significant impact on the risk of developing diabetes-related microvascular complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the strength and quality of the evidence for the use of Dexcom G6 was moderate, due to the paucity of controlled trials, the limited duration of the trial periods and the use of different comparator arms. However, the Subcommittee considered that from the evidence that is available, that CGM systems facilitate improved glycaemic control when compared with self-monitoring and that this improvement is more significant when configured with a pump in an AHCL system.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that interoperability, factory calibration, and high accuracy make the Dexcom G6 a suitable CGM option for people with type 1 diabetes. The Subcommittee recommended that it be funded with a high priority for all people with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for the Dexcom G6 CGM if it were to be funded in New Zealand for people with type 1 diabetes and those with diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis or pancreatectomy.

The Subcommittee noted that sustained fatigue can lead to burnout and poor glycaemic control.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a recent epidemiological study conducted by <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/hc/pdf/HC20067\" target=\"_blank\">Chepulis et al. (2021)</a> which recently estimated that the population prevalence of type 1 diabetes to be approximately 0.4% of the population, equating to 20,000 New Zealanders. The Subcommittee noted that another study conducted by <a href=\"https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/district-health-board-of-residence-ethnicity-and-socioeconomic-status-all-impact-publicly-funded-insulin-pump-uptake-in-new-zealand-patients-with-type-1-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">Wheeler et al. (2019)</a> which, utilising a hospital admissions and dispensing data, estimated the prevalence of type 1 diabetes to be 17,338 people between <span style=\"color: black;\">1 September 2012 and 31 December 2016.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the current standard of care for glucose monitoring <span style=\"color: black;\">is self-monitoring via a finger-prick blood test with or without the addition of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an insulin pump. The</span> <span style=\"color: black;\">Subcommittee noted that patients with good glycaemic control are typically testing on average between four and ten times per day and considered that adherence to this regimen could be challenging especially for children and young adults, as it involves maintaining a careful balance of insulin dosing, dietary intake, and exercise. The Subcommittee noted that many patients seldom test their blood glucose, but rather approximate their bolus insulin dosing to food intake and rely on a minimum viable dose of basal insulin. </span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that type 1 diabetes has a significant negative impact on quality of life for affected individuals, particularly regarding physical functioning and wellbeing. The Subcommittee noted that glycaemic variability and sustained poor glycaemic control can lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as diabetic ketoacidosis and death.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the perpetual fear of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, as well as the fear of long-term complications, can result in significant stress and anxiety.<span style=\"color: black;\"> </span>Furthermore, the Subcommittee noted that there is also a significant impact on the family and caregivers of individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while the incidence of type 1 diabetes is lower in M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, they are disproportionately represented in hospital admissions data for diabetic ketoacidosis and suffer significantly poorer outcomes than other patient populations. The Subcommittee noted that a study by Carter et al. (2008) reported that lower SES and ethnicity were independent predictors of poor glycaemic control in children with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>General Comments Regarding CGM and FGM</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that diagnostic blood glucose test meters and strips are funded for patients meeting certain eligibility criteria, including individuals receiving insulin and that there are currently no flash or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems funded for use within New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that it had previously recommended the Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system for funding with a high priority. The Subcommittee noted that FGM systems permits manual sensor augmented multiple daily insulin (MDI) dosing with better data, but not the advantage of advanced features of insulin pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems utilise sensor electrodes inserted into the subcutaneous tissue (usually on the abdomen), to measure glucose in the interstitial fluid, which is then converted into an electronic signal and transmitted via a low energy Bluetooth signal (range in the air about 6 meters) to either a reader or smart device where it is displayed for the user as a glucose reading.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are functional distinctions between CGM and FGM, namely that CGM systems include a transmitter that automatically transmits a continuous stream of real-time numerical and graphical information about the current glucose level and velocity of change to the user\u2019s optional receiver or smartphone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while current FGM systems do provide glucose level trend arrows to encourage closer monitoring or intervention, they tend to be user-initiated and typically require the sensor to be manually scanned with a reader device. The Subcommittee considered that the major limitation of FGM systems is that they not designed to be integrated with insulin pumps or provide alarm features for either predicted nor actual hypoglycaemia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can be used as a stand-alone monitoring device to guide insulin delivery or paired with an insulin pump as an integrated pump system with advanced features such as predictive low glucose suspend and bolus autocorrections. The Subcommittee considered integrated pump therapy to be a significant improvement from the status quo for people with type 1 diabetes, which is either capillary glucose informed MDI or capillary glucose informed pump therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that integrated pump systems vary significantly in their functionality based on the software used to pair the devices. The Subcommittee considered there to be the following classes of integrated pump systems:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy: where there is little or no interoperability between the pump and the CGM system and the user must make data-informed decisions around basal settings and bolus dose calculations.</li><li>Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems: where an algorithm modulates basal insulin delivery with predictive-low glucose suspend of insulin delivery but does not give automated boluses.</li><li><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Advanced hybrid-closed loop (AHCL) systems: where an algorithm enables automated correction boluses, a meal detection module can let the system deliver more aggressive automated correction boluses and intensification of basal insulin delivery to consistently target near normal glycaemia.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems can differ substantially in their accuracy, build-quality, calibration requirements, and closed-loop functionality. The Subcommittee considered that the field of glucose monitoring technologies was evolving rapidly and noted that funding applications for the Dexcom and Guardian CGM systems were the first to be referred to the Subcommittee for clinical advice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems are likely to improve the time spent in the target glycaemic range (TIR), reduce the time spent in hypoglycaemia, and reduce the number of hypoglycaemic events requiring medical attention when used with or without insulin pump therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that the major benefits were likely to accrue when paired with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee noted that this was particularly true of when the CGM is integrated with an insulin pump with advanced features such as sensor informed correction boluses and predictive low glucose suspend.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that these technologies would likely benefit all people with difficult to control diabetes with the evidence strongest for the use in the type 1 diabetes setting. The Subcommittee considered that patients with diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis and patients who have undergone a pancreatectomy, should be considered within the same grouping of \u2018people with diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy.\u2019</p><p><br></p><p>While the Subcommittee noted that there were benefits associated with CGM systems in place of finger-prick testing, the Subcommittee considered that these benefits may wane overtime, with some patients suffering from \u2018user fatigue\u2019 associated with the constant stream of information.\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that this was less likely to be the case if used in a hybrid closed loop system with an insulin pump. The Subcommittee considered that FGM informed MDI may be more suitable in people with type 1 diabetes who are not eligible for insulin pump therapy. The Subcommittee also noted that FGM sensors can be used for up to 14 days of use, almost twice the duration of many CGM systems.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that both FGM and CGM systems can be used on a temporary basis or intermittent basis for patients initiating multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens to enable insulin dose-titration. The Subcommittee noted that CGM data can also inform decisions around driving safety, particularly among those with hypoglycaemic unawareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that CGM systems were most beneficial to patients with type 1 diabetes when paired with an insulin pump, but that there are people with type 1 diabetes who would benefit from these technologies who do not meet the current pump SA eligibility criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the pump criteria should be reviewed to identify patient subpopulations that would most benefit from the paired technologies but that there was a clear unmet health need in type 1 diabetes patients with severe unexplained hypoglycaemia and/or recurrent DKA in the first instance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were a number of equity considerations relating to the funding of CGM particularly regarding equity of access to the digital technologies (i.e. smart phones) required to utilise some CGM systems. The Subcommittee noted variable resourcing across DHBs to implement education and initiation of CGM technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CGM systems are widely available internationally and is subsidised in Australia (under the Australian National Diabetes Services Scheme) and in England by the NHS. The Subcommittee noted that there is a large private market in New Zealand for these technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it should be a priority to list at least one CGM system on the Pharmaceutical Schedule and that the recommendations on whether to fund or decline particular products should be noted in within this context.</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dexcom G6 CGM </i></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee noted that the Dexcom G6 CGM system consists of an indwelling sensor and applicator, a transmitter, and either a display device or a smart phone. The Subcommittee noted that the sensor attaches to the skin with its adhesive patch and is replaced every 10 days. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee noted that the Dexcom G6 CGM transmitter wirelessly sends glucose information to a receiver or smart device running the Dexcom G6 CGM Application</span>.<span style=\"color: black;\"> The Subcommittee noted that the transmitter has a battery life of 90 days, so can be reused for approximately nine sensor sessions.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the Dexcom G6 CGM provides an urgent \u201clow soon\u201d alert that lets the user know when their glucose is falling so fast it will drop to \u2264 3.1 mmol/L in less than 20 minutes. The Subcommittee considered that predictive low glucose alerts were effective in reducing frequency, severity, and duration of rebound hypoglycaemia, as well as quality of life and sleep for patients and their family.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the Dexcom G6 subcutaneous glucose sensor, monitoring system, and software are all registered on the Web Assisted Notification of Devices (WAND) database, which is a mandatory requirement for importers, exporters, and local manufacturers (Glucose Sensor WAND reference: 180612-WAND-6QHVJD, Dexcom Glucose Monitoring System WAND reference: 120726-WAND-6DPSOM, Self-care monitoring web-based application software WAND reference: 170120-WAND-6NH34Y) and that Dexcom CGM devices are registered for the management of diabetes in persons aged two years and older in several other OECD countries.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the Dexcom G6 CGM can be paired with a number of insulin pumps, including the Tandem T: slim X2 using proprietary Basal-IQ software, a predictive low-glucose suspend feature that predicts and helps prevent hypoglycaemic events. Furthermore, the Subcommittee noted that soon to be released Control-IQ software would enable greater hybrid closed-loop functionality with automated bolus adjustment, enabling more accurate mealtime dosing with less intensive carbohydrate counting and eliminating the need for finger-prick testing for calibration. The Subcommittee considered that this would significantly decrease the burden of type 1 diabetes management.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee noted that Dexcom Share allowed data to be shared with third parties including health care professionals, friends, family and wh\u0101nau. The Subcommittee considered that this could be used to improve the calibration of insulin infusion to the patient\u2019s needs, but that there would need to be consideration given to data sovereignty, security, and permission (consent). The Subcommittee noted that DHBs are required to conduct privacy impact assessments and cloud risk assessments on data sharing applications and that vendors would need to work with DHBs on these assessments.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee noted that the primary evidence for the use of CGM in people with type 1 diabetes when compared to SMBG is provided by a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCT): </span></p><p><br></p><ul><li>The Subcommittee noted the DIAMOND trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118453/\" target=\"_blank\">Beck et al. JAMA. 2017. 24;317(4):371-8.</a>) an open-label RCT which included 158 adults 25 years and older. The Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome measure, a difference in change in central-laboratory-measured HbA1c level from baseline to 24 weeks, was 1.1% at 12 weeks and 1.0% at 24 weeks in the CGM group and 0.5% and 0.4% in the control group (P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). The Subcommittee also noted that metrics for time in range, hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, and glycaemic variability favoured the CGM group compared with the control group.</li><li>The Subcommittee noted the GOLD trial, a cross-over RCT which compared the Dexcom G4 Platinum with self-monitoring in adults aged 18 or above with type 1 diabetes treated with MDIs and with an HbA1c of at least 7.5% (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118454/\" target=\"_blank\">Lind et al.

The Subcommittee noted that mean HbA1c was 7.92% (63 mmol/mol) during CGM use and 8.35% (68 mmol/mol) during conventional treatment (mean difference, \u22120.43% [95% CI, \u22120.57% to \u22120.29%]; P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). The Subcommittee also noted reduction in the time spent in the hypoglycaemic range (particularly at night), and a reduction in hypoglycaemic fear during the CGM phase.</li><li>The Subcommittee noted the WISDM trial, an open-labelled RCT conducted comparing the Dexcom G5 CGM system with self-monitoring of blood glucose in older adults aged between 65-71 years, which reported significant reductions in HbA1c and time spent in a hypoglycaemic range in the CGM arm at follow-up (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767159\" target=\"_blank\">Pratley et al. 2020.

The Lancet. 2018. 7;391(10128):1367-77</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this trial also compared the Dexcom G5 CGM system with self-monitoring in 149 adults (aged 18 or above). The Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome, the number of hypoglycaemic events measured, was significantly reduced in the unmasked CGM when compared to the masked or self-monitoring group (incidence rate ratio 0\u00b728 [95% CI, 0\u00b720 to 0\u00b739], P &lt;0\u00b70001).</li><li><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted the following trials which provided support for the use of CGM in children and young people;</li><li><a href=\"https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/10/2537\" target=\"_blank\">Thabit et al.

The Lancet. 2021. 397(10291):2275-2283</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after 6-months the CGM arm had a more favourable time in the target glycaemic range compared with the FGM arm (59\u00b76% vs 51\u00b79%; mean difference 6\u00b785 percentage points [95% CI 4\u00b736\u20139\u00b734]; P&lt;0\u00b70001).</li><li>IHART-CGM: an open-labelled trial of 40 adults with type 1 diabetes using an MDI regimen which randomised patients into CGM and FGM groups following 2 weeks of blinded CGM (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dme.13561\" target=\"_blank\">Reddy et al. Diabetic Medicine. 2018. 35(4):483-90</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at the study endpoint the percentage of time spent in the hypoglycaemic range (&lt; 3.3 mmol/l) was 2.4%, and 6.8%, respectively (median between group difference \u22124.3%, P = 0.006).</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that both trials reported a small but marked improvement in glycaemic control (as measured by time in the target glycaemic range, HbA1c, and hypoglycaemic events) associated with use of CGM use when compared with FGM. The Subcommittee noted that the IHART-CGM extension reported a reduction in the percentage of time spent in the hypoglycaemic range over the 16-week extension (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1932296819867688\" target=\"_blank\">Avari et al.\u00a0Journal of diabetes science and technology. 2020.14(3):567-74)</a>, however, the Subcommittee considered that the extension period was still too short to validate the durability of response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the strongest evidence of benefit in terms of time in range and HbA1c was when the Dexcom G6 was paired with a matching pump and Control IQ in an AHCL system (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1907863\" target=\"_blank\">Brown et al. NEJM. 2019.381:1707-1717</a>). The Subcommittee noted that, compared with SAP therapy, AHCL led to time in range (TIR) improvements of approximately 11 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 14; P&lt;0.001) after 6 months. The Subcommittee noted that TIR results of around 70% were likely to have a significant impact on the risk of developing diabetes-related microvascular complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the strength and quality of the evidence for the use of Dexcom G6 was moderate, due to the paucity of controlled trials, the limited duration of the trial periods and the use of different comparator arms. However, the Subcommittee considered that from the evidence that is available, that CGM systems facilitate improved glycaemic control when compared with self-monitoring and that this improvement is more significant when configured with a pump in an AHCL system.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that interoperability, factory calibration, and high accuracy make the Dexcom G6 a suitable CGM option for people with type 1 diabetes. The Subcommittee recommended that it be funded with a high priority for all people with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for the Dexcom G6 CGM if it were to be funded in New Zealand for people with type 1 diabetes and those with diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis or pancreatectomy. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff. </span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000C9z0k&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001nr9J\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
