font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), where axSpA is a complex family of chronic inflammatory diseases that encompasses both non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and AS (also known as radiographic axSpA, with signs of sacroiliac joint involvement on x-ray); two diseases that are at either end of a spectrum. The Committee noted that AS ranges in severity and causes inflammatory back pain and progressive, irreversible spinal stiffness. The Committee noted that half of patients with AS have peripheral arthritis and extra-articular manifestations (eg enthesitis, fibromyalgia, depression, poor sleep) can also occur. The Committee noted that a diagnosis of AS is made according to a composite of clinical and radiographic features.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in AS which reported a higher risk of death from all causes (pooled relative risk 1.64, 95% CI: 1.49-1.80, six studies) and from cardiovascular causes (RR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.81, three studies) in patients with AS compared with the general population (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acr.24820"" target=""_blank"">Chaudhary et al. Arthritis Care Res. 2021. Online ahead of print</a>). The Committee considered that AS is probably associated with higher mortality that is mainly due to cardiovascular risk, although it was unclear whether the risk of mortality was greater in patients with more active disease compared with less active disease.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that AS onset occurs in a patient’s 20s and 30s, that the disease affects more males than females, and that a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis or uveitis confers a greater risk of developing AS. The Committee noted that prevalence of AS depends on the definition used but is reported to be between 0.1% to 0.4%, equivalent to between 4,000 and 16,000 people in New Zealand; members considered it was difficult to be more precise perhaps because of different definitions of the disease. The Committee noted that about 1,500 people receive bDMARD treatment for AS with annual growth of 5%, and considered that a reasonable estimate would be that a quarter of all cases with AS diagnosed in New Zealand are treated with a bDMARD (although no local data was available to confirm this), meaning that 4,000 patients was the most likely estimate of the overall population with AS. Members were made aware of an unpublished Dunedin-based registry study and considered that this data may help to confirm the proportion of patients who are receiving bDMARDs for AS specifically, noting that some patients have AS but do not meet funding criteria due to lack of access to MRI and having disease that cannot be seen on plain x-ray. Members considered the existing and proposed Special Authority criteria require baseline disease severity that is high, and considered that patients with severe unilateral sacroiliitis may be ineligible for funded treatment and thus not contribute to the number of patients with AS on bDMARDs.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that more than 90% of cases of AS are associated with the presence of HLA-B27, which has varying prevalence in different populations and is reported to be less common in Māori (6.5%) than non-Māori (9.2%) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24286455/"" target=""_blank"">Roberts et al. Arthritis Res Ther. 2013;15:R158</a>). The Committee considered that AS does not appear to disproportionately affect Māori, who experience lower prevalence of HLA-B27. The Committee noted that Māori account for 6.9% of all patients on bDMARD treatments for AS, but considered that this figure may underrepresent the true number of Māori with AS of this severity due to barriers and disparities affecting diagnosis and access to care.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that several measures are used to assess disease activity and functional impairment in clinical practice and/or in clinical trials for AS:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.6.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), a patient-reported assessment of disease activity and symptom severity which uses scales from zero to ten. Members considered that the BASDAI is an imperfect tool but remains the best available.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.6.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), a patient-reported assessment of difficulty with daily activities which uses a scale from zero to ten and is routinely used in secondary care.

The Committee noted that the ASAS was a clinical trial measure not used in clinical practice.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the aims of treatment of AS are to alleviate symptoms, improve functioning, maintain the ability to work, decrease disease complications and delay skeletal damage as much as possible. The Committee considered that first-line bDMARD treatment for AS would be with adalimumab for most patients (otherwise etanercept), then second-line treatment would be with secukinumab given as a four-weekly subcutaneous injection, which has been funded since May 2021. The Committee noted that clinical trials require a BASDAI of 4 for entry, considered that the current Special Authority requirement (for a BASDAI score of 6 and radiographic evidence of irreversible structural changes) for access to funded anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment with <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1878.pdf"" target=""_blank"">adalimumab</a> or <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1879.pdf"" target=""_blank"">etanercept</a> to be a high threshold, and noted that a 50% improvement from initial BASDAI score is needed to continue funded treatment (BASDAI50). The Committee considered it was unclear whether secukinumab was used second-line after one prior bDMARD and/or third-line after both adalimumab and etanercept, but considered it likely that secukinumab would become the preferred second-line option over time. Members thought it not unreasonable to estimate perhaps roughly two-thirds of patients who receive inadequate benefit from a first-line anti-TNF would be likely to receive treatment with secukinumab, although considered this would be gradual over years. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm (including where secukinumab is currently used and in what proportion(s) of patients, and the reason for lower uptake of secukinumab than anticipated for AS), and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most patients cycle through all available bDMARDS treatments, possibly including some treatment-free intervals, as their disease eventually becomes active again or they lose response to treatment. The Committee considered it likely that some patients remain on treatment despite not experiencing the BASDAI50 response required to meet renewal criteria for AS, and considered that patients who received about a 30% response would be assessed as receiving a clinically useful benefit. The Committee considered that patients who receive smaller benefits from treatment (eg. a 20% improvement in BASDAI or ASAS score) would be unlikely to stay on treatment, particularly if other funded options were available.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that loss of benefit with current treatment is associated with decreased work productivity, increased absenteeism and presenteeism, and greater impairment in daily activities in AS (<a href=""https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-020-0118-z"" target=""_blank"">Deodhar et al.

Arthritis Rheum. 2013;65:1213-23</a>). The Committee considered that, while each sequential line of treatment provides a decreasing magnitude of benefit, patients may remain on their first anti-TNF therapy for a very long time, as there are few other funded options. The Committee considered that real-world persistence on secukinumab would be higher than that reported in clinical trials, and was made aware of an abstract reporting overall adherence to secukinumab of 64.5% at one year in 311 patients with AS (<a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/78/Suppl_2/1814.2"" target=""_blank"">Klitz et al.

The Committee was made aware of evidence from a cross-sectional study of the costs associated with AS/axSpA at two hospitals in New Zealand which reported that, of 81 patients with AS, about half used bDMARDs, 42% had some mobility problems, 20% had some problems with self-care, over half had some problem with usual activities, 80% had moderate pain or discomfort, and about a third had moderate anxiety or depression (<a href=""https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/the-costs-associated-with-ankylosing-spondylitis-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-aotearoa-new-zealand"" target=""_blank"">White et al. N Z Med J. 2019;132:38-47</a>). The Committee considered that there was evidence of a broad reduction in quality of life in the study population of patients attending specialist clinics, although noted that patients with well-controlled disease or those not on bDMARDs may not be seen much in specialist clinics.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the families and whānau of people with AS also had an unmet health need with the loss of employment and family impact associated with AS. The Committee considered that people with AS have an unmet health need despite the currently available treatments, given the lifelong nature of the disease requiring subsequent treatments over the patient’s lifetime. The Committee considered that an additional treatment option would be beneficial especially in the third line.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective Janus Kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor (JAKi) and is a targeted synthetic treatment. Members considered that there does not appear to be an overall JAKi class effect yet identified, but considered that subclasses of JAKi exist and that these types have similar effects and subtle differences depending on the indication. The Committee noted that upadacitinib is <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/r/rinvoqtab.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Medsafe-approved</a> for the treatment of active AS, in effect, in adult patients for whom one or more conventional therapies have not provided an adequate response or are not tolerated.

The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for AS, as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments sequentially.

The Committee noted that prevalence of AS depends on the definition used but is reported to be between 0.1% to 0.4%, equivalent to between 4,000 and 16,000 people in New Zealand; members considered it was difficult to be more precise perhaps because of different definitions of the disease. The Committee noted that about 1,500 people receive bDMARD treatment for AS with annual growth of 5%, and considered that a reasonable estimate would be that a quarter of all cases with AS diagnosed in New Zealand are treated with a bDMARD (although no local data was available to confirm this), meaning that 4,000 patients was the most likely estimate of the overall population with AS. Members were made aware of an unpublished Dunedin-based registry study and considered that this data may help to confirm the proportion of patients who are receiving bDMARDs for AS specifically, noting that some patients have AS but do not meet funding criteria due to lack of access to MRI and having disease that cannot be seen on plain x-ray. Members considered the existing and proposed Special Authority criteria require baseline disease severity that is high, and considered that patients with severe unilateral sacroiliitis may be ineligible for funded treatment and thus not contribute to the number of patients with AS on bDMARDs.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that more than 90% of cases of AS are associated with the presence of HLA-B27, which has varying prevalence in different populations and is reported to be less common in Māori (6.5%) than non-Māori (9.2%) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24286455/"" target=""_blank"">Roberts et al.

The Committee noted that clinical trials require a BASDAI of 4 for entry, considered that the current Special Authority requirement (for a BASDAI score of 6 and radiographic evidence of irreversible structural changes) for access to funded anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment with <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1878.pdf"" target=""_blank"">adalimumab</a> or <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1879.pdf"" target=""_blank"">etanercept</a> to be a high threshold, and noted that a 50% improvement from initial BASDAI score is needed to continue funded treatment (BASDAI50). The Committee considered it was unclear whether secukinumab was used second-line after one prior bDMARD and/or third-line after both adalimumab and etanercept, but considered it likely that secukinumab would become the preferred second-line option over time. Members thought it not unreasonable to estimate perhaps roughly two-thirds of patients who receive inadequate benefit from a first-line anti-TNF would be likely to receive treatment with secukinumab, although considered this would be gradual over years. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm (including where secukinumab is currently used and in what proportion(s) of patients, and the reason for lower uptake of secukinumab than anticipated for AS), and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most patients cycle through all available bDMARDS treatments, possibly including some treatment-free intervals, as their disease eventually becomes active again or they lose response to treatment.

The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for AS, as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments sequentially.

two diseases that are at either end of a spectrum. The Committee noted that AS ranges in severity and causes inflammatory back pain and progressive, irreversible spinal stiffness. The Committee noted that half of patients with AS have peripheral arthritis and extra-articular manifestations (eg enthesitis, fibromyalgia, depression, poor sleep) can also occur. The Committee noted that a diagnosis of AS is made according to a composite of clinical and radiographic features.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in AS which reported a higher risk of death from all causes (pooled relative risk 1.64, 95% CI: 1.49-1.80, six studies) and from cardiovascular causes (RR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.81, three studies) in patients with AS compared with the general population (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acr.24820"" target=""_blank"">Chaudhary et al. Arthritis Care Res. 2021. Online ahead of print</a>). The Committee considered that AS is probably associated with higher mortality that is mainly due to cardiovascular risk, although it was unclear whether the risk of mortality was greater in patients with more active disease compared with less active disease.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that AS onset occurs in a patient’s 20s and 30s, that the disease affects more males than females, and that a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis or uveitis confers a greater risk of developing AS. The Committee noted that prevalence of AS depends on the definition used but is reported to be between 0.1% to 0.4%, equivalent to between 4,000 and 16,000 people in New Zealand; members considered it was difficult to be more precise perhaps because of different definitions of the disease. The Committee noted that about 1,500 people receive bDMARD treatment for AS with annual growth of 5%, and considered that a reasonable estimate would be that a quarter of all cases with AS diagnosed in New Zealand are treated with a bDMARD (although no local data was available to confirm this), meaning that 4,000 patients was the most likely estimate of the overall population with AS. Members were made aware of an unpublished Dunedin-based registry study and considered that this data may help to confirm the proportion of patients who are receiving bDMARDs for AS specifically, noting that some patients have AS but do not meet funding criteria due to lack of access to MRI and having disease that cannot be seen on plain x-ray. Members considered the existing and proposed Special Authority criteria require baseline disease severity that is high, and considered that patients with severe unilateral sacroiliitis may be ineligible for funded treatment and thus not contribute to the number of patients with AS on bDMARDs.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that more than 90% of cases of AS are associated with the presence of HLA-B27, which has varying prevalence in different populations and is reported to be less common in Māori (6.5%) than non-Māori (9.2%) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24286455/"" target=""_blank"">Roberts et al. Arthritis Res Ther. 2013;15:R158</a>). The Committee considered that AS does not appear to disproportionately affect Māori, who experience lower prevalence of HLA-B27. The Committee noted that Māori account for 6.9% of all patients on bDMARD treatments for AS, but considered that this figure may underrepresent the true number of Māori with AS of this severity due to barriers and disparities affecting diagnosis and access to care.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that several measures are used to assess disease activity and functional impairment in clinical practice and/or in clinical trials for AS:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.6.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), a patient-reported assessment of disease activity and symptom severity which uses scales from zero to ten.

The Committee considered that first-line bDMARD treatment for AS would be with adalimumab for most patients (otherwise etanercept), then second-line treatment would be with secukinumab given as a four-weekly subcutaneous injection, which has been funded since May 2021. The Committee noted that clinical trials require a BASDAI of 4 for entry, considered that the current Special Authority requirement (for a BASDAI score of 6 and radiographic evidence of irreversible structural changes) for access to funded anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment with <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1878.pdf"" target=""_blank"">adalimumab</a> or <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/06/01/RS1879.pdf"" target=""_blank"">etanercept</a> to be a high threshold, and noted that a 50% improvement from initial BASDAI score is needed to continue funded treatment (BASDAI50). The Committee considered it was unclear whether secukinumab was used second-line after one prior bDMARD and/or third-line after both adalimumab and etanercept, but considered it likely that secukinumab would become the preferred second-line option over time. Members thought it not unreasonable to estimate perhaps roughly two-thirds of patients who receive inadequate benefit from a first-line anti-TNF would be likely to receive treatment with secukinumab, although considered this would be gradual over years. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm (including where secukinumab is currently used and in what proportion(s) of patients, and the reason for lower uptake of secukinumab than anticipated for AS), and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most patients cycle through all available bDMARDS treatments, possibly including some treatment-free intervals, as their disease eventually becomes active again or they lose response to treatment. The Committee considered it likely that some patients remain on treatment despite not experiencing the BASDAI50 response required to meet renewal criteria for AS, and considered that patients who received about a 30% response would be assessed as receiving a clinically useful benefit. The Committee considered that patients who receive smaller benefits from treatment (eg. a 20% improvement in BASDAI or ASAS score) would be unlikely to stay on treatment, particularly if other funded options were available.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that loss of benefit with current treatment is associated with decreased work productivity, increased absenteeism and presenteeism, and greater impairment in daily activities in AS (<a href=""https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-020-0118-z"" target=""_blank"">Deodhar et al.

The Committee considered that real-world persistence on secukinumab would be higher than that reported in clinical trials, and was made aware of an abstract reporting overall adherence to secukinumab of 64.5% at one year in 311 patients with AS (<a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/78/Suppl_2/1814.2"" target=""_blank"">Klitz et al.

The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for AS, as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments sequentially.

The Committee considered that there may still be a small number of individuals who would use infliximab instead of upadacitinib due to the effectiveness of anti-TNF treatment. The Committee considered that upadacitinib does not provide sufficient clinical benefit to be used ahead of secukinumab for most people.</p><p><br></p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment paradigm for AS should be tailored to each individual.

The Committee considered that AS is also associated with slow progression of disease, and individuals may not have seen their rheumatologist since the funding of secukinumab. The Committee considered more accurate data on secukinumab uptake may be available in 2-3 years.

The Committee considered that assuming there is broad equivalence of efficacy across bDMARDS, sequencing should be driven by financial impact, as there is limited direct comparison data available. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume, based on the evidence available, that upadacitinib has similar efficacy to secukinumab.</p><p><br></p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that upadacitinib would be used for most individuals as a third-line option before infliximab due to suitability and stability advantages. The Committee considered that there may still be a small number of individuals who would use infliximab instead of upadacitinib due to the effectiveness of anti-TNF treatment. The Committee considered that upadacitinib does not provide sufficient clinical benefit to be used ahead of secukinumab for most people.</p><p><br></p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment paradigm for AS should be tailored to each individual. The Committee considered that if all aspects (including costs) were equal, then it would be clinically useful to have upadacitinib available after trial of anti-TNF treatment, and alongside secukinumab and infliximab, as per the <a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/82/1/19"" target=""_blank"">ASAS-EULAR guidelines</a>.\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral treatment which can be self-administered at home, and that in comparison, secukinumab is given as a subcutaneous injection in either a primary or secondary care clinic with monthly dosing after the initial dosing period.</p><p><br></p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered people requiring treatment for AS may prefer upadacitinib due to its oral administration.</p><p><br></p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Cost and savings</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was funded in a second-line setting, only a small group would receive upadacitinib instead of a second-line anti-TNF, due to the effectiveness of second-line anti-TNFs. The Committee considered that if listed second-line, upadacitinib may still be used third line after secukinumab in a group of people, due to the effectiveness of and familiarity with secukinumab.</p><p><br></p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that lower than expected uptake of secukinumab may be attributed to the generally good effectiveness of anti-TNFs in AS, which results in the proportion of those with AS who required an additional treatment being relatively low. The Committee considered that AS is also associated with slow progression of disease, and individuals may not have seen their rheumatologist since the funding of secukinumab. The Committee considered more accurate data on secukinumab uptake may be available in 2-3 years. The Committee considered that it seemed plausible that uptake for upadacitinib in this setting would be similar to the uptake observed for secukinumab in AS, or potentially slightly higher given upadacitinib’s suitability advantages.</p><p><br></p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.27.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for upadacitinib if it was funded for ankylosing spondylitis.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
