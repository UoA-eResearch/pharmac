The Committee noted that more significant bleeds or surgeries would require the use of FVIII or FVIII with von Willebrand\u2019s factor (Biostate).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment protocols including desmopressin are developed according to an individual\u2019s need and procedure or bleed type, taking into account baseline FVIII level and the desired FVIII response (typically at least 30%) and duration. The Committee noted that current best practice is for these individuals to receive an initial dose of desmopressin under the supervision of a haematologist to identify those who benefit, given variable responses are anticipated due to factors including von Willebrand genotype and FVIII levels.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that von Willebrand disease prevalence in New Zealand is approximately 0.01% based on the current literature and real-world experience in Auckland. The Committee noted that in Auckland there are about 160 people with von Willebrand disease (mostly type I), 178 with mild haemophilia A, 10 haemophilia A carriers, and a small number of individuals with nonspecific bleeding disorders. The Committee noted that in Auckland in the previous 12 months, 10 people with von Willebrand disease and two individuals with mild haemophilia A received desmopressin for minor surgery and muscle bleeds, respectively.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the majority of people with mild haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease currently receive desmopressin in a hospital setting alongside their treatment protocol and are well known to their closest haemophilia treatment centre. However, the Committee considered that there are differences in access in different parts of the country and in some regions individuals need to travel several hours to attend their closest centre.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health need in this population resulted from the challenges in accessing this formulation of desmopressin in a timely manner for offsite use, predominantly for minor surgical procedures and minor bleeding issues which do not require blood products. The Committee considered that the unmet need in relation to the impact of mild to moderate Haemophilia A, von Willebrand disease or inherited platelet disorders on M\u0101ori health outcomes was similar to that of non-M\u0101ori in terms of ease of access to treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health Benefit</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that desmopressin is a synthetic form of the normal human hormone arginine vasopressin (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH) which mimics the FVIII stress response and increases vWF/VIII levels. The Committee noted that a number of desmopressin presentations are already funded for community and hospital use without restriction and that the requested presentation (15mcg/mL vial; Octostim brand) is listed in Section H.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that DDAVP 15mcg/mL vial <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/Datasheet/o/Octostiminj.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Octostim</a>) is approved by Medsafe for the therapeutic control of bleeding and bleeding prophylaxis in connection with minor surgical procedures in those with mild haemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease who respond positively to a test dose (although must not be used in von Willebrand\u2019s disease type IIB).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application recommends desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) 15mcg/mL vial be used at a dose of 0.3 mcg per kg subcutaneously (SC) for acute bleeding (either a single dose or with a second dose 12 hours later if required), or prophylaxis (a single dose prior to a surgical procedure with one or two doses postoperatively if required). Members considered that this reflected the dosing used for standard of care in New Zealand and noted that the maximum volume administered would be up to 2.0 mL with a response expected to peak in about two or three hours. The Committee considered that there is extensive clinical experience with desmopressin in New Zealand for bleeding disorders and that it is often used in combination with tranexamic acid.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the submission included six publications providing evidence and guidelines regarding the use of desmopressin in this context, and that Pharmac staff identified three additional publications of relevance:</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028205027895\" target=\"_blank\">Kadir et al.

The Committee considered that the unmet need in relation to the impact of mild to moderate Haemophilia A, von Willebrand disease or inherited platelet disorders on M\u0101ori health outcomes was similar to that of non-M\u0101ori in terms of ease of access to treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health Benefit</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that desmopressin is a synthetic form of the normal human hormone arginine vasopressin (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH) which mimics the FVIII stress response and increases vWF/VIII levels.

The Committee noted that current best practice is for these individuals to receive an initial dose of desmopressin under the supervision of a haematologist to identify those who benefit, given variable responses are anticipated due to factors including von Willebrand genotype and FVIII levels.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that von Willebrand disease prevalence in New Zealand is approximately 0.01% based on the current literature and real-world experience in Auckland. The Committee noted that in Auckland there are about 160 people with von Willebrand disease (mostly type I), 178 with mild haemophilia A, 10 haemophilia A carriers, and a small number of individuals with nonspecific bleeding disorders. The Committee noted that in Auckland in the previous 12 months, 10 people with von Willebrand disease and two individuals with mild haemophilia A received desmopressin for minor surgery and muscle bleeds, respectively.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the majority of people with mild haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease currently receive desmopressin in a hospital setting alongside their treatment protocol and are well known to their closest haemophilia treatment centre.

The Committee considered that the unmet need in relation to the impact of mild to moderate Haemophilia A, von Willebrand disease or inherited platelet disorders on M\u0101ori health outcomes was similar to that of non-M\u0101ori in terms of ease of access to treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health Benefit</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that desmopressin is a synthetic form of the normal human hormone arginine vasopressin (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH) which mimics the FVIII stress response and increases vWF/VIII levels. The Committee noted that a number of desmopressin presentations are already funded for community and hospital use without restriction and that the requested presentation (15mcg/mL vial; Octostim brand) is listed in Section H.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that DDAVP 15mcg/mL vial <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/Datasheet/o/Octostiminj.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Octostim</a>) is approved by Medsafe for the therapeutic control of bleeding and bleeding prophylaxis in connection with minor surgical procedures in those with mild haemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease who respond positively to a test dose (although must not be used in von Willebrand\u2019s disease type IIB).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application recommends desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) 15mcg/mL vial be used at a dose of 0.3 mcg per kg subcutaneously (SC) for acute bleeding (either a single dose or with a second dose 12 hours later if required), or prophylaxis (a single dose prior to a surgical procedure with one or two doses postoperatively if required). Members considered that this reflected the dosing used for standard of care in New Zealand and noted that the maximum volume administered would be up to 2.0 mL with a response expected to peak in about two or three hours. The Committee considered that there is extensive clinical experience with desmopressin in New Zealand for bleeding disorders and that it is often used in combination with tranexamic acid.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the submission included six publications providing evidence and guidelines regarding the use of desmopressin in this context, and that Pharmac staff identified three additional publications of relevance:</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028205027895\" target=\"_blank\">Kadir et al.

The Committee considered there might be a small reduction in hospital visits where telephone management occurs instead.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that desmopressin doses are limited to avoid tachyphylaxis (ie only one or two doses over 48 hours), that the risks of fluid retention and occasional severe hyponatraemia are managed with a cautious approach for the very young and the elderly (eg with vascular disease), that people with nonspecific bleeding disorders and normal or high FVIII levels may develop very high FVIII levels leading to an increased thrombotic risk, and that risks associated with intravenous fluids would not be expected with minor surgery or minor bleeds. The Committee considered that the known risks would not increase substantially if the 15mcg/mL vial were funded in the community, as current practice involves an initial trial dose to determine response, careful management, and age selection.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that clinical use of desmopressin would not be expected to increase significantly if the 15mcg/mL vial were funded in the community, and it would continue to not be used for all bleeding events (eg not for unexplained perioperative bleeds, and not for severe haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease types IIB or III where little benefit would be expected). The Committee considered that desmopressin would unlikely be used as a primary treatment for individuals with mild bleeding or menorrhagia although a small proportion of those so affected would be diagnosed with von Willebrand disease and therefore use desmopressin in later lines after tranexamic acid and other treatments.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there would likely be a small increase in the total use of desmopressin if it were to be funded in the community, as some people who live further away from a hospital currently go without treatment for some milder bleeding events. The Committee considered that these individuals would be expected to receive desmopressin if it were to be funded in the community. The Committee considered that this would represent a minority of individuals, and that the majority of community desmopressin use would be among those who are currently receiving it in a hospital setting.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Suitability</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the key benefits of funding desmopressin 15mcg/mL vial in the community would be improved ease of access and earlier access to treatment, which might prevent ongoing bleeds and be especially beneficial for those individuals who live at a distance from their haemophilia treatment centre. The Committee considered that those known to respond to desmopressin could also avoid an additional visit to their haemophilia treatment centre and could receive desmopressin in the community either prior to, other treatments (if needed), or instead of receiving treatment in hospital. The Committee further considered this would enable them to access minor surgery in the community with minimal risk and would be useful for those who may need to or wish to travel (eg for work or recreation).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that funding the 15mcg/mL vial for community use would not pose challenges in terms of subcutaneous administration given that many people living with haemophilia and their caregivers are familiar with the technique. The Committee considered it could also be used easily by primary care nurses, or in private hospitals, with support from the haemophilia treatment centre regarding dosing, timing and management of side effects. The Committee noted that appropriate disposal of the syringe and sharps would be required.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Costs and Savings</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">3.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that funding the 15mcg/mL vial for community use would not significantly change desmopressin use overall due to current practice.

This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000004AoMG&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EMOZ0000002EA9\" alt=\"Desmopressin PICO Table.png\"></img></p>",
