The Subcommittee noted that 2017 hospital discharge rates show that hospitalisation rates are highest for Pacific people, then Māori, European and Asian groups. The rate for Pacific people is approximately three times that for Māori or European.</p><p>4.9 The Subcommittee noted that in recent years, approximately 1.2 million doses of influenza vaccine have been distributed each year, which equates to approximately 28% of the population covered. The Subcommittee noted that estimated coverage for high risk groups receiving funded vaccine is approximately 3% for children aged 0-4, 30% for pregnant women and 65% for people aged 65 years or over. Subsets of the 65 year and over group include Māori with 46% coverage and Pacific people with 51% coverage.</p><p>4.10 The Subcommittee noted that vaccine effectiveness of inactivated vaccines declines at 8% per month. This suggests that the elderly may have very little protection by 3- 4 months after vaccination. The Subcommittee considered that it would be necessary to increase coverage with inactivated influenza vaccines above the current 28% coverage to generate herd immunity. The Subcommittee considered that improving vaccine effectiveness in the elderly would have a greater impact on the elderly.</p><p>4.11 The Subcommittee considered a retrospective cohort study by Izurieta et al. Lancet Infect Dis. 2015;15: 293–300 which demonstrated a stronger immune response to a high dose trivalent influenza vaccine (hdTIV) in the elderly compared to a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). This study showed hdTIV was 22% more effective in reducing hospitalisations in the elderly, compared to TIV. The Subcommittee considered that hdTIV would provide an additional health benefit to those aged over 65 years and over, with minimal additional risks compared to TIV or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). Members noted that hdTIV is not currently available in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that hdTIV would be likely to work in people 50 years of age and older from an immunological point of view, although data is lacking to support this view and it is not approved for use in people under 65 years of age.</p><p>4.12 The Subcommittee considered an observational study of adjuvanted influenza vaccination in an elderly population in Northern Italy by Mannino et al. Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176: 527–533 which showed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) gave a 25% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation. The Subcommittee considered that aTIV would provide an additional health benefit to those aged over 65 years and over, with minimal additional risks compared to a TIV or QIV.</p><p>4.13 The Subcommittee noted that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is administered intranasally and is indicated for those aged 2-49 years. The Subcommittee considered that LAIV generates a broader immune response than inactivated influenza vaccines. The Subcommittee noted that LAIV has been used in both the US and UK, but there were issues with the H1N1 response in the US and LAIV has not been recommended in the US for the 2017/2018 season. The Subcommittee noted that more response data is expected be become available over coming influenza seasons, particularly from England.</p><p>4.14 The Subcommittee considered that vaccination of primary school age children contributes to herd immunity, protecting high risk individuals who may respond less well to vaccines. The Subcommittee considered that a universal childhood influenza vaccination programme would only be achievable using LAIV, with optimal delivery through a school based programme. The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no registered LAIV product in New Zealand.</p><p>4.15 The Subcommittee considered that universal childhood influenza vaccination would provide additional health benefits with minimal additional risks. The Subcommittee considered that additional benefits would include the ability to generate herd immunity, protection of the wider community and reduced hospitalisation of children. The Subcommittee considered that the groups who would benefit most from universal childhood vaccination are the elderly and those with comorbidities. The Subcommittee considered that there is not a particularly high disease burden in school based children. The Subcommittee considered that while vaccinating children may protect other groups, it is an ethical consideration that the children themselves should also derive benefit from the vaccination.</p><p>4.16 The Subcommittee considered that there are some groups disproportionately affected by influenza, including Māori, Pacific people, NZ Dep 9-10 deprivation, refugees and asylum seekers. The Subcommittee considered the concept of “risk stacking” for influenza, but noted that data is lacking to support this approach to targeting.</p><p>4.17 The Subcommittee considered the concept of “ring protection” ie. the protection of high risk groups by vaccinating close contacts. The Subcommittee considered that ring protection theoretically would provide a health benefit to high risk groups. The Subcommittee noted that only 65% of DHB healthcare workers are vaccinated, but approximately 80% coverage would be required to protect high risk groups. The Subcommittee noted that there is limited evidence supporting the ring fence approach.</p><p>4.18 The Subcommittee considered that the introduction of any of hdTIV, aTIV, LAIV or universal childhood vaccination could result in reduced healthcare costs in some years. The Subcommittee considered that if herd immunity was generated, then there would be healthcare savings. The Subcommittee recommended that PHARMAC conduct cost effectiveness analysis on universal vaccination compared to childhood school vaccination to achieve herd immunity and bring the results back to a future Subcommittee meeting.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Clinical advice questions from the Ministry of Health</i></p><p>4.19 The Subcommittee considered that the definition of coverage level required to achieve community immunity depends on vaccine effectiveness; and can only ever be partial for influenza. UK data suggests that for school children, 30% coverage achieves indirect protection.</p><p>4.20 The Subcommittee considered that it would be more effective to use LAIV in a school based delivery programme, as this would have better user acceptibility. The Subcommittee considered that it would be expensive to implement a school based programme.</p><p>4.21 The Subcommittee considered a study by Mannino et al. J Amer Epidemiol 2012 which showed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) gave a 25% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation.

The Subcommittee considered that hdTIV would provide an additional health benefit to those aged over 65 years and over, with minimal additional risks compared to TIV or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV).</p><p>4.23 The Subcommittee considered that there was limited evidence supporting the use of multiple vaccine doses to protect those aged 65 years and over.</p><p>4.24 The Subcommittee considered that the observed higher mortality from influenza in Māori and Pacific populations is related to lower coverage in these groups.</p><p>4.25 The Subcommittee considered that current coverage of targeted groups is not high, so expanding eligibility to Māori and Pacific from a younger age does not address the low coverage. The Subcommittee considered that increasing coverage was likely to be the best way to protect more Māori and Pacific people.</p><p>4.26 The Subcommittee considered that target strategies for particular groups often lead to other inequities.

<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
