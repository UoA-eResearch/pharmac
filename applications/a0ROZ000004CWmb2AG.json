The Committee noted that quinacrine is a synthetic drug developed in the 1930s, which was subsequently replaced by chloroquine, and finally HCQ.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in the <a href=\"https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/78/6/736.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2019 update of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines</a>, the recommendation for the management of SLE was for patients to receive HCQ and glucocorticoids in the first instance, followed if necessary by methotrexate and/or azathioprine for mild to moderate SLE. The Committee noted that HCQ is recommended over chloroquine due to its multiple beneficial effects and possible lower risk for retinal toxicity. The Committee noted that the EULAR recommendation that, in cases of inadequate response or evidence of toxic retinopathy, quinacrine may be used as an add-on or sequential therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the benefits of HCQ in relief of constitutional symptoms, musculoskeletal manifestations, and muco-cutaneous manifestations of SLE, and that some small randomised trials and observational studies suggest that HCQ may reduce flare rates, thrombotic events, organ damage accrual, and mortality, with an 80% disease remission rate for patients with non-organ-threatening SLE. The Committee noted that HCQ is used for the treatment of patients with SLE in New Zealand, usually at a maximum dose of 5 mg per kg: an average dose of 200 mg per day for the majority of patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in the case of SLE skin disease (also referred to as cutaneous lupus erythematosus), approximately 40% of patients will experience insufficient response to first-line treatment with anti-malarial medications (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112801/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Chasset et al.

The Committee noted that in 5 of the 6 of the patients the addition of quinacrine to the previous treatment was associated with complete remission (SLEDAI 0 to 2 points), which persisted over the follow-up period (mean 2.2 years (range 0.5 to 3.5)). The Committee also noted that 400 mg is a higher dose than the 200 mg per day dose that would usually be prescribed.</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29635998/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Ugarte et al.

The Committee noted that SLEDAI scores decreased significantly from baseline at both 6 months (score reduction of 2.8 points; 95% CI 1.9 to 3.7) and 12 months (score reduction of 3.5 points; 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4).

Arthritis Rheumatol. 2020; online ahead of print</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for the use of quinacrine for SLE was limited, poor quality, and primarily older literature with less rigorous reporting than is currently expected in reporting of treatment studies, or retrospective cohort studies. The Committee considered that it is unlikely any new studies or data on the use of quinacrine for SLE will become available, due to the age of the drug and availability of other, more modern medications. The Committee noted that quinacrine was only used in combination with other therapies, and not as monotherapy, in all of the studies included in the Chasset et al. meta-analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that compared with HCQ, quinacrine has a faster onset of action (4-6 months vs 2-4 weeks) and less retinal toxicity, but a higher rate of aplastic anaemia, which the Committee considered to be idiosyncratic rather than dose-related. The Committee noted that quinacrine also potentially has a more positive effect on patient fatigue, and SLE related skin issues when compared to HCQ. The Committee considered that funding quinacrine for SLE may lead to an increased expenditure to the health system to monitor for aplastic anaemia, but noted the uncertainty of how often aplastic anaemia occurs, and a lack of comprehensive safety data regarding this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no Medsafe approved quinacrine product, however the Committee considered that Medsafe registration is unlikely due to lack of data and commercial viability. The Committee noted that very few clinicians in New Zealand use this agent, and SLE patients usually tolerate HCQ well. The Committee noted that currently, patients for whom HCQ fails would have methotrexate added to their treatment regimen and considered that it is unclear if quinacrine would be used in place of this. The Committee considered the number of patients unable to tolerate methotrexate would likely be small.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that epidemiological data on SLE occurrence in New Zealand is limited, but that the rate is estimated at 11 people per 100,000, and patients are predominantly female.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific people have a greater relative risk of all types of cutaneous SLE than New Zealand Europeans (relative risk: 2.47; 95% CI 1.67 to 3.67), particularly discoid lupus (relative risk: 5.96; 95% CI 3.06 to 11.6) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27235700/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Jarrett et al.

The Committee noted that quinacrine is a synthetic drug developed in the 1930s, which was subsequently replaced by chloroquine, and finally HCQ.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in the <a href=\"https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/78/6/736.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2019 update of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines</a>, the recommendation for the management of SLE was for patients to receive HCQ and glucocorticoids in the first instance, followed if necessary by methotrexate and/or azathioprine for mild to moderate SLE. The Committee noted that HCQ is recommended over chloroquine due to its multiple beneficial effects and possible lower risk for retinal toxicity. The Committee noted that the EULAR recommendation that, in cases of inadequate response or evidence of toxic retinopathy, quinacrine may be used as an add-on or sequential therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the benefits of HCQ in relief of constitutional symptoms, musculoskeletal manifestations, and muco-cutaneous manifestations of SLE, and that some small randomised trials and observational studies suggest that HCQ may reduce flare rates, thrombotic events, organ damage accrual, and mortality, with an 80% disease remission rate for patients with non-organ-threatening SLE. The Committee noted that HCQ is used for the treatment of patients with SLE in New Zealand, usually at a maximum dose of 5 mg per kg: an average dose of 200 mg per day for the majority of patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in the case of SLE skin disease (also referred to as cutaneous lupus erythematosus), approximately 40% of patients will experience insufficient response to first-line treatment with anti-malarial medications (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112801/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Chasset et al.

The Committee noted it had considered quinacrine for SLE at its November 2020 meeting and had recommended it be declined. The Committee noted the applicant\u2019s response regarding the review of quinacrine for SLE.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee agreed with the applicant\u2019s comments regarding an unmet health need in people with SLE and considered there is an unmet health need in people with SLE. However, the Committee considered it was unlikely this unmet health need would be addressed by quinacrine, as there was little identifiable high quality evidence to support its efficacy and the Committee considered there was still a lack of quinacrine-specific evidence able to be presented in the applicant\u2019s response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the clinical risks of quinacrine in this setting, and that this agent is not Medsafe-approved for any use in New Zealand, and its adverse event profile differences compared with the currently funded options, primarily the risk of aplastic anaemia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the evidence regarding methotrexate provided by the applicant and that the use of quinacrine in SLE is commented on in the 2019 updated EULAR guidelines. However, the Committee considered the evidence for the use of quinacrine was limited quality, with most of the evidence consisting of case reports or case series with a high risk of bias with respect to the clinical effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered the group of people with hydroxychloroquine intolerance would likely be a relatively large group. The Committee considered the side effect profile for individuals with an allergy to hydroxychloroquine may experience similar adverse effects skin changes and anaphylaxis, with quinacrine. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee did not consider it necessary to re-review the application. The Committee based this on the limited evidence available, the potential adverse effect profile, and lack of a Medsafe-approved product.\u00a0</p>",
