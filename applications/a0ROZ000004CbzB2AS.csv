Members noted that opioid-induced constipation can be so significant that opioid dose is reduced to alleviate the issue, which can compromise pain management.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that opioid-induced constipation is a significant problem in patients receiving palliative care, with a prevalence of approximately 47% of patients with cancer and 32% of patients who do not have cancer (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/national-health-needs-assessment-for-palliative-care-jun11.pdf"" target=""_blank"">National health Needs Assessment for Palliative Care. Phase 1 Report: Assessment of Palliative Care Need. June 2011</a>). The Committee considered that there are factors other than opioid use that contribute to constipation in patients receiving palliative care (eg, dehydration, immobility, diet, polypharmacy). The Committee also considered that patients in palliative care are receiving higher doses of opioids than patients with non-palliative pain.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the application requested funding for methylnaltrexone for use in hospital as a rescue therapy for intractable opioid-induced constipation following trauma or surgery; however, the Committee considered that methylnaltrexone has the potential to provide a benefit to a wider group of non-palliative patients, including patients receiving opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. The Committee considered that the evidence for use in this population should also be reviewed.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that opioid-induced constipation has a substantial impact on quality of life in patients with chronic non-cancer pain, and is associated with increased healthcare resource utilization and hospital costs following orthopaedic surgery (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112202"" target=""_blank"">Veiga et al.

The Committee noted that if this is insufficient, opioid-induced constipation is treated with an escalating regime of osmotic laxatives and enemas. The Committee considered that the use of pre-emptive treatment means that intractable opioid-induced constipation requiring manual disimpaction occurs rarely. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that methylnaltrexone is a competitive antagonist of opioid receptor binding, with selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor.

The Committee considered that a subcutaneous agent may be of benefit in patients who are unable to receive oral medications and can be administered by the patient or their caregivers with appropriate training.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that methylnaltrexone is the only peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonist available for use in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that PTAC previously considered evidence for the use of methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in palliative care patients provided by two phase 3 trials: MNTX 301 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19278178"" target=""_blank"">Slatkin et al.

At that time, the Committee recommended funding this with a low priority, and suggested the application be reviewed by the Analgesic and Gastrointestinal Subcommittees of PTAC (now the Analgesic Advisory and Gastrointestinal Advisory Committees respectively) regarding appropriate eligibility criteria due to the potentially large population which may be prescribed methylnaltrexone bromide.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the application was reviewed by the Analgesic Advisory Committee in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2022-05-05-Analgesics-Advisory-Committee-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2022</a>, where methylnaltrexone bromide was recommended for funding with medium priority. The Committee also noted that at this meeting, the Analgesic Advisory Committee had estimated that approximately 1600 people may receive this treatment annually, which was significantly higher than numbers previously estimated. The Analgesic Advisory Committee had also considered that the highest health need was in people with chronic non-cancer pain with opioid induced constipation, as these individuals would likely be taking opioids for extended periods of time.

These include the use of general or spinal anaesthesia, the need for a high level of opioids following surgery, suppressed motility with bowel stasis in response to abdominal surgery, and reduced ambulation. In addition, the Committee noted that in the hospital setting there are some types of surgery, for example obstetrics or gynaecological surgery, whereby opioid induced constipation can be difficult to treat, and often needs to be avoided to minimise any damage to the anatomical area where the surgery has occurred.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there are a number of available funded laxatives in the hospital setting and that for the majority of those affected these are appropriate.

The Committee also noted that for some individuals three days without laxation could still be their normal bowel habit.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
</ul>
