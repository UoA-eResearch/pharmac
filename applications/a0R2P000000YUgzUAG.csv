'Published_Discussion': {'s': '<p>The Committee noted that breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women worldwide, and that in 2017 there were 3316 new cases of breast cancer reported across both women and men in New Zealand (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/new-cancer-registrations-2017"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">New Zealand Cancer Registry, 2019</a>). The Committee also noted that approximately 80% of breast cancer patients present with early breast cancer (eBC) and that there are approximately 650 deaths from breast cancer per year in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) occurs in around 15-20% of breast cancers in New Zealand (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771902"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Lawrenson et al. NZMJ. 2018;131:51-60</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Māori and Pacific people have a higher incidence of breast cancer than those of European/Other descent, are more likely to have HER2 positivity, and have a higher mortality rate. The Committee noted that Māori are usually diagnosed later than non-Māori, and that Pacific peoples are less likely to be diagnosed through screening, which is associated with their incidence of advanced breast cancer being higher (although not necessarily causing this). The Committee noted that people in the Asian population often present with larger cancers at diagnosis, are more likely to be HER2 positive than European/Other but have a lower rate of BC mortality.\xa0</p><p>The Committee noted that currently eligible patients with HER2 positive disease may be administered chemotherapy in combination with the HER2-targeted agent, trastuzumab, as neoadjuvant therapy (before surgery) aiming to shrink the tumour prior to resection, and/or as adjuvant therapy (following surgery), for a combined total of 52 weeks neo/adjuvant treatment. The Committee noted that not all patients receive neo-adjuvant treatment prior to surgery. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that CaTSoP, at its <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">September 2018 meeting</a>, considered an application for pertuzumab for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive locally advanced, inflammatory or high risk early stage breast cancer. The Committee noted that the Subcommittee had considered that at that time between 50 and 70 patients with HER2 positive breast cancer would be offered neoadjuvant therapy in New Zealand; however, this would likely increase with time, given trends for increasing neoadjuvant treatment. The Committee noted that CaTSoP members considered that the patients most likely to be offered neoadjuvant therapy include those who have locally advanced breast cancer where surgery may not achieve adequate margins, patients who have locally advanced breast cancer who would generally be considered for mastectomy but have a preference for breast conserving surgery, and patients with HER2-positive or triple negative breast cancer who have tumours greater than 2 cm in size. The Committee noted that there is a difference in the rates of neoadjuvant treatment between centres, in part due to the increased complexity around treatment planning and surgical staff availability. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted that in September 2018 CaTSoP had considered that the benefits associated with the use of neoadjuvant therapy include avoiding delays in treatment due to surgical complications, but had considered that the evidence available at that time for neoadjuvant treatment did not demonstrate that neoadjuvant therapy provides an overall survival advantage, although it does allow more patients to undergo breast conserving surgery rather than mastectomy, and would delay rather than prevent future treatment lines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, internationally, the incidence of residual disease after neo-adjuvant systemic treatment with trastuzumab is considered approximately 70.5% (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27179402/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Gianni et al. Lancet Oncol. 2016;17(6):791-800</a>), however the applicant had indicated from anecdotal data that the rate in New Zealand may be approximately 50-60%. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there appeared to be limited data available for the use of residual disease occurrence following neoadjuvant HER2 targeted therapy as a predictor for disease recurrence or death in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a summary of a poster presentation by Swain et al. 2020 provided by the applicant on the risk of recurrence of HER2 positive breast cancer following HER2 targeted therapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The Committee noted that recurrence rates reported ranged from 17-40% depending on the HER2 targeted agents used, if there was a combination of agents, and if patients achieved complete pathological response following treatment. The Committee noted that there appeared to be limited data available on 5-year recurrence rates of HER2 positive breast cancer following treatment with trastuzumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that in the absence of a complete pathological response following neoadjuvant treatment and surgery, patients can be treated with adjuvant capecitabine either as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel. The Committee noted that the evidence for use of capecitabine in a general population was based on extrapolation of a small Japanese study in which a subset of patients with a non-pathologic response had improved outcomes from the addition of capecitabine (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1612645"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Masuda et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;76(22):2147-59</a>). The Committee considered that although capecitabine is not an appropriate comparator for trastuzumab emtansine given the quality of evidence, it should be taken into account as part of the treatment paradigm if it is being used currently in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate that contains the humanised anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, covalently linked to the microtubule inhibitory drug DM1 (a maytansine derivative) with the stable thioether linker MCC. Emtansine refers to the MCC-DM1 complex. The Committee noted that the mechanism of action of T-DM1 allows the DM1 to be preferentially delivered to tumour cells, limiting the damage to surrounding tissues. The Committee noted that T-DM1 is Medsafe-approved for the requested indication. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the supplier had proposed T-DM1 as the standard therapy for HER2 positive early breast cancer in patients who have residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment that included HER2-targeted therapy. The Committee noted that the supplier had considered that T-DM1 would not replace neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment and would not be used in post-surgery treatments where patients had had a complete response. The Committee noted that the supplier had considered that patient response to neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab would be assessed either pre- or post-surgery in resected tissue. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a phase III, two-arm, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial (the KATHERINE trial, n=1486), which investigated the efficacy of T-DM1 compared with trastuzumab (both 3-weekly over 42 weeks) in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual disease at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy plus HER2 targeted therapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30516102"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Von Minckwitz et al. N Engl J Med 2019;380:617-28</a>). The Committee noted that there was no recruitment from New Zealand in the trial, however the Committee considered that the New Zealand patient population would meet similar criteria as those recruited for the trial. The Committee also noted that the adjuvant portion of the treatment course with trastuzumab is the appropriate comparator to T-DM1 in the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that invasive disease was reported to be less common in the T-DM1 group compared with the trastuzumab treatment group (12.2% and 22.2%, respectively), the hazard ratio (HR) for invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) at 3 years was 0.50 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.64) favouring T-DM1, and that freedom from distant recurrence at 3 years also favoured T-DM1 (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.79). The Committee also noted that although the OS data was immature, the point estimate of the hazard ratio favoured T-DM1 (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.05; p=0.08). The Committee noted that there was no evidence of a different treatment effect in sub-groups of the trial participants. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that T-DM1 had an inferior safety profile compared with trastuzumab, with serious adverse events occurring in 12.7% of the T-DM1 group compared to 8.1% of the trastuzumab group, and that adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 18.0% of the T-DM1 group compared to 2.1% of the trastuzumab group. The Committee considered that this difference in safety was likely due to the components of the antibody-drug conjugate being more cytotoxic than trastuzumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of the KATHERINE trial was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) as a surrogate for OS. The Committee noted that the applicant referenced a 2019 study (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30709633"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Saad et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:361-70</a>), in which the validity of disease-free survival (DFS) as a surrogate for OS in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer in trials of adjuvant trastuzumab for up to 1 year was assessed via systematic review and meta-analysis, with the objective to estimate patient-level and trial-level correlations between OS and DFS.

Emtansine refers to the MCC-DM1 complex. The Committee noted that the mechanism of action of T-DM1 allows the DM1 to be preferentially delivered to tumour cells, limiting the damage to surrounding tissues.

The Committee also noted that although the OS data was immature, the point estimate of the hazard ratio favoured T-DM1 (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.05; p=0.08). The Committee noted that there was no evidence of a different treatment effect in sub-groups of the trial participants. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that T-DM1 had an inferior safety profile compared with trastuzumab, with serious adverse events occurring in 12.7% of the T-DM1 group compared to 8.1% of the trastuzumab group, and that adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 18.0% of the T-DM1 group compared to 2.1% of the trastuzumab group. The Committee considered that this difference in safety was likely due to the components of the antibody-drug conjugate being more cytotoxic than trastuzumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of the KATHERINE trial was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) as a surrogate for OS.

The Committee noted that there was no recruitment from New Zealand in the trial, however the Committee considered that the New Zealand patient population would meet similar criteria as those recruited for the trial. The Committee also noted that the adjuvant portion of the treatment course with trastuzumab is the appropriate comparator to T-DM1 in the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that invasive disease was reported to be less common in the T-DM1 group compared with the trastuzumab treatment group (12.2% and 22.2%, respectively), the hazard ratio (HR) for invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) at 3 years was 0.50 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.64) favouring T-DM1, and that freedom from distant recurrence at 3 years also favoured T-DM1 (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.79). The Committee also noted that although the OS data was immature, the point estimate of the hazard ratio favoured T-DM1 (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.05; p=0.08). The Committee noted that there was no evidence of a different treatment effect in sub-groups of the trial participants. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that T-DM1 had an inferior safety profile compared with trastuzumab, with serious adverse events occurring in 12.7% of the T-DM1 group compared to 8.1% of the trastuzumab group, and that adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 18.0% of the T-DM1 group compared to 2.1% of the trastuzumab group. The Committee considered that this difference in safety was likely due to the components of the antibody-drug conjugate being more cytotoxic than trastuzumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of the KATHERINE trial was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) as a surrogate for OS. The Committee noted that the applicant referenced a 2019 study (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30709633"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Saad et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:361-70</a>), in which the validity of disease-free survival (DFS) as a surrogate for OS in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer in trials of adjuvant trastuzumab for up to 1 year was assessed via systematic review and meta-analysis, with the objective to estimate patient-level and trial-level correlations between OS and DFS. The Committee noted that patient-level associations between DFS and OS were reported to be strong (Spearman’s correlation coefficient=0·90; 95% CI 0·89 to 0·90) However, the Committee considered that, in a disease such as this with multiple lines of treatment and a relatively long survival, that it was difficult to interpret the relationship of a surrogate marker such as DFS with OS. </p><p>The Committee noted patient reported outcomes from the KATHERINE trial, for which 70% of patients in the trial submitted data (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286687/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Conte et al.

The Committee noted that mean changes in global, cognitive, physical and fatigue scores were similar between the two treatment groups and that most changes in score were not clinically meaningful and returned to baseline. </p><p>Overall, the Committee considered there was limited evidence of moderate strength and high quality to support the use of T-DM1 as adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer in patients who have residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment that included HER2-targeted therapy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that use of this agent would be associated with an increase in adverse-event related costs to the health system if T-DM1 were to be funded in this setting, and may be further compounded by an increase in demand for neoadjuvant therapy with more options available. The Committee considered that funding in this setting would likely result in an increase in clinical staff workload and demand for infusion capacity. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that at its <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">August 2019</a> meeting it had previously considered an application for trastuzumab biosimilar and that it would be clinically acceptable for the treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The Committee noted that there were several trastuzumab biosimilars available internationally. The Committee considered that, given this competition, it was likely a significant price change for trastuzumab may occur in the near future, which should be considered in any economic assessment as this would influence the cost-effectiveness of T-DM1 if it were to be funded in the proposed setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, while a positive recommendation was supported at this time, which was based on the currently available evidence and current pricing for differential between trastuzumab and T-DM1, it was however unclear what the OS gain with use of T-DM1 in this setting would be and whether this would be of sufficient magnitude to offset the associated increase in adverse events. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was unclear what the role of T-DM1 would be in the treatment paradigm and management of patients with eBC who may go on to develop metastatic disease. The Committee noted that trastuzumab emtansine is currently funded for the second-line treatment of metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer and that it was uncertain what the response would be for patients with metastases who had received adjuvant treatment with T-DM1 for their early breast cancer and what, if any, evidence there was to support its use in this way. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, contrary to instructions in the <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/funding-guidelines-2019-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Guidelines for Funding Applications to PHARMAC</a>, the supplier’s application contained a substantial amount of information that was of limited relevance, and at times irrelevant, for the evaluation of evidence for the use of T-DM1 in the adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer, and considered that this increased the difficulty for the Committee to evaluate the evidence provided in a timely manner.

The Subcommittee noted that those treated with T-DM1 had 6-7% lower incidence of recurrence of disease when compared with trastuzumab (unstratified HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to .079), and there was no difference in unexpected deaths between the two treatment groups. The Subcommittee noted that preliminary overall survival was not significantly different at 60 months and considered that additional follow-up would be necessary to evaluate the true effect of T-DM1 on overall survival. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that more adverse events occurred in the T-DM1 treatment group, including adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation such a platelet count and blood bilirubin decreases, but noted that cardiovascular toxicity was similar between those treated with T-DM1 and trastuzumab. The Subcommittee noted that the safety data were consistent with known manageable toxicities of T-DM1, and that the increased with T-DM1 were to be expected. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>\xa0The Subcommittee considered the KATHERINE trial to be highly relevant to the New Zealand population, as neoadjuvant therapy is becoming standard of care for this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that although the trial participants were primarily European, it is unlikely that Māori and Pacific patients in New Zealand would have differences in treatment effect, and that although Māori and Pacific people have a higher incidence of HER2 positive disease, poorer outcomes in these groups stem from later diagnoses and differences in access to healthcare as opposed to tumour biology. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if T-DM1 were to be funded in this setting, there would be no change in the proportion of patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab as part of their therapy. The Subcommittee considered that of the 3500 new breast cancer registrations every year, approximately 220-280 would be candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. The Subcommittee considered that of these 220-280, approximately 50% would achieve pathological complete response, meaning at least 110 women per year would be candidates for adjuvant T-DM1 treatment. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that should T-DM1 be funded in this setting, there would be no material impact on clinical resource use, as patients would otherwise continue to receive trastuzumab alone. The Subcommittee considered that there would be approximately 10% fewer women needing treatment for metastatic disease were T-DM1 to be funded in this setting, and that the number of women relapsing following adjuvant therapy would decrease by approximately 50 should T-DM1 be used after neoadjuvant therapy. The Subcommittee considered that unless evidence of activity on re-treatment was shown, practitioners would not advocate for re-treatment with T-DM1 in the metastatic setting following prior use as adjuvant therapy, but that clinicians would still want the option to use trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.\xa0</p>', 'PTAC_Comments__c': '<p>1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In relation to item 10 and CaTSoP’s consideration of trastuzumab-emtansine for the treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer in patients who have residual disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment:</p><p>1.1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the Subcommittee’s recommendation that this be funded with a high priority within the context of treatments of malignancy and resolved that based on CaTSoP’s assessment of the application against PHARMAC’s Factors for Consideration, the Committee would change its earlier priority recommendation for this application from low to now become <b>medium</b>.</p><p>1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there remained residual uncertainty regarding the use of trastuzumab in the metastatic setting following prior use of trastuzumab-emtansine in the adjuvant setting.
