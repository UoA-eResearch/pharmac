N Engl J Med. 2019;381:432-43</a>), which showed that after a median follow up of 33.6 months, that the ibrutinib-rituximab showed improved progression free survival compared with FCR (89.4% vs. 72.9% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.56; P&lt;0.001) and an overall survival (98.8% vs. 91.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; P&lt;0.001).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the appropriate comparator for ibrutinib in this setting would be obinutuzumab-chlorambucil.

The Subcommittee considered that defining groups by eligibility for chemoimmunotherapy may create inequities within the wider CLL patient population, by giving an unfair advantage to those patients less physically/physiologically fit, and that it would not be appropriate to determine eligibility for ibrutinib based on eligibility for and appropriateness of FCR treatment.</p>",
