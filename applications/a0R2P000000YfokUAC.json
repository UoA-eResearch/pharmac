The Subcommittee noted that this application did not extensively define \u201cserious mental health conditions\u201d but used a proxy of people who are prescribed clozapine. The Subcommittee noted that people with serious mental health conditions or addiction are not currently eligible for funded influenza vaccination in the community, although patients in long-stay inpatient mental health care units or who are compulsorily detained long-term in a forensic unit within a DHB hospital are eligible due to increased risk of infection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that only about 28% percent of the total population receives influenza vaccine annually. Current coverage for eligible people under 65 years of age with comorbidities is less than 50% and funded coverage for people over 65 years of age is 57%. The Subcommittee noted that pregnant women and people over 65 years of age can currently receive funded influenza vaccine in a community pharmacy. The Subcommittee considered that coverage of both target groups and the general population is low and that vaccinations given by occupational health nurses, which may not be recorded in the National Immunisation Register, is unlikely to account for much more coverage of the under 65 age group with comorbidities.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that community opioid treatment services (OTS) are provided through community alcohol and drug services (CADS). Typically patients would have daily to weekly pharmacist contact. CADS generally encourage GP shared care with 3 monthly visits. Engagement with GPs varies across the country, with estimates of 40% shared care in Auckland and 20% in Wellington.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that clozapine is prescribed for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Patients taking clozapine should be monitored for symptoms and signs of cardiac toxicity, neutropenia and constipation. Regular blood tests are mandatory to detect blood dyscrasias and for continued supply of the medicine. Pharmacists have a role in this monitoring, ensuring that the blood test has been had within three days of the medicine being dispensed. In this way, patients are very engaged with community pharmacy, but less likely to be engaged with their GP as they would typically be managed by secondary services. The Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 4,300 patients prescribed clozapine in 2016. Approximately 600 pharmacies are approved to administer influenza vaccine, but only approximately 400 of these are actively administering influenza vaccine each season.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a number of studies and papers provided with the application, including:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.080\" target=\"_blank\">Khieu et al.

There may be a gain in equity of access if pharmacists were able to administer influenza vaccine to people under 65 years of age with comorbidities. The Subcommittee considered that there would be a number of potential implementation issues to address if pharmacists were to vaccinate people under 65 years of age with comorbidities, as pharmacists do not have access to patient healthcare records and will not easily be able to confirm the patient\u2019s eligibility.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the influenza vaccine applications it had previously considered included earlier access before 65 years of age for M\u0101ori and Pacific People, and universal childhood vaccination.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funded groups for influenza vaccine differ across countries.

The Subcommittee noted that this application did not extensively define \u201cserious mental health conditions\u201d but used a proxy of people who are prescribed clozapine. The Subcommittee noted that people with serious mental health conditions or addiction are not currently eligible for funded influenza vaccination in the community, although patients in long-stay inpatient mental health care units or who are compulsorily detained long-term in a forensic unit within a DHB hospital are eligible due to increased risk of infection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that only about 28% percent of the total population receives influenza vaccine annually. Current coverage for eligible people under 65 years of age with comorbidities is less than 50% and funded coverage for people over 65 years of age is 57%. The Subcommittee noted that pregnant women and people over 65 years of age can currently receive funded influenza vaccine in a community pharmacy. The Subcommittee considered that coverage of both target groups and the general population is low and that vaccinations given by occupational health nurses, which may not be recorded in the National Immunisation Register, is unlikely to account for much more coverage of the under 65 age group with comorbidities.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that community opioid treatment services (OTS) are provided through community alcohol and drug services (CADS). Typically patients would have daily to weekly pharmacist contact. CADS generally encourage GP shared care with 3 monthly visits. Engagement with GPs varies across the country, with estimates of 40% shared care in Auckland and 20% in Wellington.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that clozapine is prescribed for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Patients taking clozapine should be monitored for symptoms and signs of cardiac toxicity, neutropenia and constipation. Regular blood tests are mandatory to detect blood dyscrasias and for continued supply of the medicine. Pharmacists have a role in this monitoring, ensuring that the blood test has been had within three days of the medicine being dispensed. In this way, patients are very engaged with community pharmacy, but less likely to be engaged with their GP as they would typically be managed by secondary services. The Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 4,300 patients prescribed clozapine in 2016. Approximately 600 pharmacies are approved to administer influenza vaccine, but only approximately 400 of these are actively administering influenza vaccine each season.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a number of studies and papers provided with the application, including:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.080\" target=\"_blank\">Khieu et al.

J Infect 2017;75:225-33</a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Khieu et al. (2015) modelled all cause hospitalisation rates per 100,000 for the period 1994-2008. The modelling gave rates of 149.9 for people aged 65-79 years; 80.0 for M\u0101ori of all ages; and 83.3 for Pacific People of all ages. The Subcommittee noted that Khieu et al. (2017) modelled influenza mortality, estimating the average mortality rate and identifying differences in risk by age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic position. The modelling estimated a crude influenza mortality rate of 13.5 per 100,000 for all causes, and a rate of 90.3 per 100,000 for influenza-attributable deaths in people aged 65 years and older. The Subcommittee considered that this modelling data was consistent with national general practice and virological surveillance, indicating that the annual burden from influenza is high in New Zealand and highest in older adults.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Khieu et al. (2017) found a large disparity of influenza attributable mortality among ethnic groups. M\u0101ori and Pacific People had higher mortality rates compared to European/Others, but also accounted for only 3% of the total population of people aged 80 years and over. Age-standardised mortality rates showed that the risk of influenza deaths was higher for M\u0101ori (2.7 times) and Pacific People (1.5 times) than that for European and Others.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there are inequities in access to influenza vaccine for M\u0101ori and Pacific Peoples. Influenza vaccination coverage measured through general practice claims submitted to the Ministry of Health suggest that up to 25 June 2021, 46% of M\u0101ori and 56% of Pacific People aged 65 years and over had been vaccinated, compared to 62.5% of the overall population aged 65 years and over.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered Ministry of Health cohort data for the five-year period 2015-2019. The data was for people who had at least one dispensing of clozapine and who had attended at least one in-scope mental health and addiction activity in the same year. It included demographics, immunisation events, PHO enrolments and publicly funded hospital discharges where the primary diagnosis is in Chapter 10 Diseases of the respiratory system (ICD 10 version 8 codes J00-J99). The Subcommittee noted that, as supplied by the applicant, the data required further analysis to remove patient duplication and remove patients from ICD codes other than the relevant respiratory ICD codes J00-J99. The Subcommittee noted that, on average, 42% of patients receiving clozapine were either of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity, and 42.7% of hospitalisations were for M\u0101ori or Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that, on average, 14% of the cohort was vaccinated.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered an observational study of potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPH) in New South Wales mental health service users (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/potentially-preventable-hospitalisations-for-physical-health-conditions-in-community-mental-health-service-users-a-populationwide-linkage-study/A0AD5F79F8686B35F6095E8DF227F904\" target=\"_blank\">Sara et al. Epidemiology and Psychiatric Services. 2021;30:1-10</a>). The Subcommittee noted that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.mental health service users had higher rates of PPH admission (AIRR<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\">[1]</span> 3.6 (CI 3.5-3.6)) and a larger number of hospital days (AIRR 5.2 (CI 5.2-5.3)) than other NSW residents.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.2.potentially preventable hospitalisations were substantially increased in people with mental health conditions.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.3.vaccine preventable hospitalisations increased sharply in mental health service users from 35 years of age onwards.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.4.increased rates of PPH in mental health service users were not accounted for by socioeconomic disadvantage.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence supporting influenza vaccination for people with serious mental health conditions or addiction is of low quality, but considered from first principles that there is good biological and psychosocial plausibility. The Subcommittee considered that there is stronger evidence supporting COVID-19 vaccination for people with serious mental health conditions or addiction, but noted a lot of resource has been applied to studying COVID-19 vaccination in the context of the global pandemic, in contrast to the lack of ongoing research into influenza vaccination.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that estimates of the eligible group size based on the number of people using clozapine and opioid substitution treatment likely underestimated the size of the group that would benefit from influenza vaccination. The Subcommittee considered that the group most likely to benefit from influenza vaccination was the same as the mental health group defined for COVID-19 vaccine eligibility in Group 3 (patients with a serious mental health condition (schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder) and people currently accessing secondary and tertiary mental health and addiction services).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for influenza vaccine if it were to be funded in New Zealand for serious mental health or addiction patients meeting the proposed eligibility criteria. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000006PuU0&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001lfbu\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p><p><b style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><i>[1]</i></b><i> AIRR: adjusted incident rate ratio</i></p>",
