The Committee noted PTAC advice (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2013-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2013</a>) that M\u0101ori are treated at a later stage, at a younger age and have a higher mortality from breast cancer compared with non-M\u0101ori.</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee had requested it review the technology assessment reports for nab-paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer undertaken by Pharmac staff. The Committee noted that these reports related to proposals (for metastatic breast cancer (mBC), mBC contraindicated or intolerant to taxanes or following a grade 3+ hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel) which are currently ranked on the Pharmac <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/ranking-lists-for-funding-applications?reportType=OFI\" target=\"_blank\">Options For Investment</a> list.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that prior to its review in 2021, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC had recommended in 2019</a> that nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of mBC be listed only if cost-neutral to weekly paclitaxel, taking into account pharmaceutical and administration costs.</p><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2021 recommendation</a> from CaTSoP (recommended with a medium priority) for nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of mBC. In making this recommendation, CaTSoP had considered the reduction in burden on clinical resources from a shorter infusion duration, the likely benefit that could be achieved from nab-paclitaxel therapy compared with paclitaxel therapy, the improved toxicity profile and suitability of nab-paclitaxel compared with comparator therapies.</p><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2021 recommendation</a> from CaTSoP (recommended with a high priority) for nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of mBC in individuals with history of hypersensitivity reactions, or contraindication to paclitaxel. In making this recommendation, CaTSoP had considered the health need of people with mBC contraindicated or intolerant to paclitaxel therapy, the likely benefit that could be achieved from nab-paclitaxel therapy in those contraindicated or intolerant to taxane therapy and the improved toxicity profile and suitability of nab-paclitaxel compared with comparator therapies.</p><h3><em>Summary of feedback on cost-effectiveness modelling</em></h3><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee provided<strong> </strong>the following feedback for consideration by Pharmac staff, in relation to the cost-effectiveness modelling:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Incidence of severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel be increased to 2-4%, based on evidence from <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information?search=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-&amp;usage_type=default&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;display_rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">UpToDate</a></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Consider including the costs of morbidity associated with reactions (adverse events) less than a grade 3, nor clinical resource responding to these less severe events and consequent lesser delays in treatment</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The comparator in those people unable to have paclitaxel due to severe adverse events or hypersensitivity in those with mBC be amended to vinorelbine or capecitabine.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The chair time associated with infusions should be amended to 45 minutes for nab-paclitaxel and 2 hours for paclitaxel.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The modelling should reflect an increased opportunity cost of using clinical administration resource (ie the benefit of nab-paclitaxel requiring less time for administration of prophylactic anti-allergy medicines and re-challenges post-reaction relative to paclitaxel treatment, and requiring less chair time than comparator treatments, allowing for other treatments to be administered and reducing public waiting list times) to reflect current pressures on public hospital cancer treatment infusion services. The Committee acknowledged the difficulties associated with modelling this, and that if a change was implemented, it would need to be applied across all applications. The Committee acknowledged that the current proposal with paclitaxel as a comparator was particularly pertinent, given paclitaxel\u2019s significant usage across New Zealand and the impacts on resource utilisation in Te Whatu Ora hospitals and subsequent impacts on individual care for other conditions.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the three groups specified for funding: anyone with mBC, people with mBC with adverse events who discontinue paclitaxel, and people with mBC with grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel.</p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel were 45% overall (any reaction) and 1 to 2% with severe reactions (ie grade 3+) despite prophylaxis with corticosteroids and H1 and H2 blockers 30 minutes prior to administration. The Committee considered that prophylaxis only reduces the incidence but does not eliminate severe reactions. The Committee noted its previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>hypersensitivity reactions of any severity can occur in up to 45% of people treated with paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>10-15% of individuals experience an immediate or delayed cutaneous reaction of any severity, and 7% experience a grade 3 or 4 neuropathy reaction, likely due to the cremaphor solvent in paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>severe life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 2-4% of people, and 1 to 2% of individuals may still develop hypersensitivity reactions despite prophylactic anti-allergy medication.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in one scenario in which usage was restricted to people with severe hypersensitivity reactions, Pharmac staff had assumed that 10% of all individuals with mBC may receive nab-paclitaxel. This represents the lower bound of the 10 to 15% estimate, since it was assumed that even if 15% experienced a reaction, not all people with mild reactions would receive nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac staff had estimated the proportion with a hypersensitivity reaction in spite of prophylactic anti-allergy medication at 1.5%; a midpoint of the range provided in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered, again, that hypersensitivity reactions were caused primarily by the solvent that paclitaxel is delivered in and that these reactions are less likely to occur with the nab-paclitaxel formulation. The Committee noted its advice in July 2021 that it was a concern that 7% of people experienced neuropathy associated with paclitaxel, though considered that based on current evidence, there was a similar or slightly higher risk of neuropathy with nab-paclitaxel. However, the Committee considered that treatment-related neuropathy was highly reversible, and that rates were lower with the recommended 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose of nab-paclitaxel. The Committee considered that the other potential adverse effects occurred at similar frequencies and severity between formulations eg myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, myelosuppression, and nausea and vomiting.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction of funding for people with at least a grade 3 adverse event to apply only to those who have mBC was inequitable to people with other tumour types, and that the proposed population should be extended to any person who has a grade 3+ hypersensitivity reaction on paclitaxel therapy for any cancer type.</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction to mBC with grade 3+ hypersensitivity limited the use in anyone with grade 3+ hypersensitivity (in the curative or palliative settings and other tumour types). The Committee noted that paclitaxel is used in treating many cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, across gynaecological cancers, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cancers whose primary sources are unknown, and that funding nab-paclitaxel as an option for these further cancer types would increase the total overall time gains to paclitaxel cancer infusion service chair times and thus further reduce the overall burden on cancer infusion services.</p><p>14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that people with pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer would also benefit from nab-paclitaxel. The Committee noted that an application for nab-paclitaxel for first-line, metastatic pancreatic cancer had been ranked on the Pharmac <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/ranking-lists-for-funding-applications?reportType=OFI\" target=\"_blank\">Options For Investment</a> list. The Committee noted that Pharmac has not yet received an application for nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The Committee considered that standard treatment for ovarian cancer is paclitaxel with carboplatin, this combination having a significant (up to 10%) risk of adverse events, such that people often receive the carboplatin part of the regimen alone. The Committee considered that this carboplatin-alone option was sub-optimal, and that a future application for this group would be of interest to advise on the benefit of nab-paclitaxel for this indication.</p><h3><em>Health benefit </em></h3><p>15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, compared with paclitaxel, those who received neo-adjuvant nab-paclitaxel experienced higher pathological complete response (pCR) and invasive disease free survival (IDFS) but overall no statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS), but considered the clinical trials were underpowered to detect statistically significant effects on OS (see previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting). The Committee noted that nab-paclitaxel was under consideration as a treatment for metastatic disease in the present proposal, not as a neo-adjuvant treatment.</p><p>16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered its previous advice at the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting, which stated that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>compared with paclitaxel or docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 125 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> or 150 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> in metastatic breast cancer was reported to have a higher objective response rate (ORR) and disease-free survival (DFS)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the main benefit of nab-paclitaxel (at the currently considered 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose) was evidenced by a clinical review, which showed nab-paclitaxel\u2019s more manageable toxicity profile, with response rates maintained relative to solvent-based taxanes including paclitaxel (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465168/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin M. Breast Cancer Res. 2015; 17(1):81</a>)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the PICO table of the record of the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a> meeting reflected the findings of that clinical review and therefore stated that, for those who do not have severe hypersensitivity reactions on paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel would offer no significant difference in overall survival, progression free survival, or quality of life.</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that for those people that have a reaction to paclitaxel, treatment with nab-paclitaxel would result in a quality of life and at least progression-free survival (PFS) would improve resulting from them being able to continue treatment.</p><p>18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>However, the Committee considered that a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) benefit associated with nab-paclitaxel at the 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose may be plausible, and that a small benefit associated with improved ORR or DFS should be incorporated into cost effectiveness modelling, if material.</p><p>19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that nab-paclitaxel would only be a substitute for paclitaxel, not docetaxel, as summarised in the PICO table in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><h3><em>Suitability </em></h3><p>20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that both formulations are now given weekly as standard practice. The Committee noted its previous advice (July 2021) regarding the 30-minute time duration required to administer nab-paclitaxel but considered that 45 minutes would be allowed in practice. The Committee also noted the important difference in the chair time required for nab-paclitaxel (45 minutes allowed) and paclitaxel (2 hours total chair time allowed). The Committee considered the significant difference in the chair time was related to the administration time (30 minutes v 60 minutes) and time needed for prophylactic anti-allergy medicines prior to paclitaxel, and for those with a previous allergic reaction additional time allowed for a re-challenge.</p><p>21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the impact that the longer infusion time and other factors associated with paclitaxel has on the oncology units and use of resource (chair time) in the context of the current health system pressures., Particularly the public wait times for oncology treatment overall (all cancers, additional to metastatic breast cancer and other cancers treated with paclitaxel) and the detrimental effect of this on outcomes for these other people.</p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\"> </em><em>\u00a0</em></p><p><em>Cost and savings</em></p><p>22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that for those people who had either a severe adverse event or grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, the comparator used in modelling was gemcitabine. The Committee considered the use of gemcitabine was not standard therapy for mBC. The Committee considered that it would be more appropriate for modelling to use capecitabine or vinorelbine as the comparator in this population (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22418569/\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. Oncologist. 2012;17:476-84</a>). The Committee considered that vinorelbine and capecitabine (estimated 20% response rate after anthracycline treatment) typically have lower response rates than taxanes (estimated 40% response rate) after treatment with anthracycline. The Committee considered there were no direct head-to-head comparison studies comparing either of these agents with nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the modelling for all mBC (regardless of adverse events) did not include morbidity associated with reactions (adverse events) less than a grade 3, nor clinical resource responding to these less severe events and consequent lesser delays in treatment, affecting both the individual and others awaiting treatment. The Committee suggested that Pharmac staff should consider including these costs in their cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><h3><em>Nab-paclitaxel across all considered indications</em></h3><p>24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in general at Pharmac, health benefit from reducing costs to the health sector are included implicitly in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Namely, if Pharmac funded a treatment like nab-paclitaxel which reduced the usage of health sector resources, like infusion services, the Vote Health budget otherwise spent on those resources would be made available to spend on other health-producing services, or the scarce resources themselves would be available for use by other individuals who would benefit from them.</p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the benefit which can be obtained by releasing more oncology infusion capacity may be more than the average benefit from other health services, due to the limited resource available to administer oncology treatments. Hence, while the Committee considered that funding any specific treatment would not resolve the issues currently faced by the system, it considered that the potential health gain from making infusion capacity available should be appropriately reflected in the cost effectiveness modelling.</p><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that making health resources available for other uses could be incorporated into economic modelling by either including a higher cost associated with services which are scarce or produce a higher level of benefit than other services, or as an additional benefit, in QALYs. The Committee noted that in either case, the additional health gain associated with specific health resources would need to be sufficiently long term to be applied consistently across economic assessments over time. The Committee considered that most oncology clinics were at, or over, capacity, and there is unlikely to be a rapid increase in capacity to administer even more infusions within the public system, which means that the opportunity cost of using infusion services was likely to be a long-standing concern.</p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>To estimate the additional cost, the Committee considered that clinicians may be able to provide Pharmac with more accurate information about the cost in practice of providing certain services currently eg a higher cost of infusion services if, with such low capacity, clinical staff are being contracted at a higher wage to provide these. However, the Committee noted the sensitivity analysis presented by Pharmac staff in the technology assessment report where the cost of treatment administration was tripled for all agents, which resulted in a far greater increase for comparator treatments, which have the greatest baseline administration cost. The Committee noted the minor increase in cost utility in this scenario, in both the models for people with any severe adverse event and for people with a severe hypersensitivity reaction only. The Committee noted that this was because the administration costs displaced by nab-paclitaxel are vastly exceeded by the additional treatment cost of nab-paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Alternatively, the Committee considered that the additional people able to be treated in the public system through chair time saved by using nab-paclitaxel could be captured in the model as a numerating health benefit rather than a denominating nominal health sector cost offset saving (where Pharmac\u2019s technology assessments express summary metrics as incremental quality-adjusted life years saved (QALYs) per $1 million net health sector incremental costs (QALYs/$1million), with net health benefits as numerator and net costs as denominator). The Committee considered that the bed/chair and clinician time made available by funding nab-paclitaxel would allow more people overall to be treated by cancer infusion services and would increase the timeliness of treatment with infused medicines.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some people may not receive treatment due to the strain on infusion services currently, and that delaying the start of chemotherapy for people who do eventually receive treatment affects the outcome of that treatment eg in colorectal cancer and triple negative breast cancer treatment, it makes a substantial difference to potentially curative outcomes whether treatment starts in the first 4 weeks. The Committee estimated that the average wait for treatment administration was 6 to 8 weeks, with a 3-to-4-week initial treatment period. The Committee considered that delays in starting treatment result in loss of benefit of the treatments, in particular a 2% loss per week for breast cancer and 4% loss per week for colorectal cancer. The Committee considered that mitigating such delays (by removing the need for lengthier and potentially more problematic paclitaxel infusions and freeing chair time for other groups) was the \u2018real-world\u2019 in-practice benefit from nab-paclitaxel treatment, in addition to what the Committee considered to be the incremental benefits to the individual of nab-paclitaxel itself over paclitaxel.</p><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that these factors are considered qualitatively, but QALY gains of this sort are not included in the cost effectiveness model, because:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>infusion administration time is included in the cost effectiveness model as a denominating cost, so including time savings as a numerating benefit would double-count the impact of shorter infusions,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>capacity constraints in health services vary over time and locality, making forecasting highly uncertain, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>extensive information would be needed to estimate them, including:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the number of additional people who would now be able to receive treatment,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each individual would be expected to receive, across the gamut of cancers treated with their counterfactual health losses and converse health gains by having infused treatments more available, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each currently treated individual could receive, on average, by receiving more timely treatment.</p><p>31.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it may be feasible to acquire available data relating to the people awaiting treatment administration (including indication and therapy required) from Te Aho o Te Kahu. Members considered this would be representative of the infusion waiting lists and priority throughout the country, but that this would not be useful without a reliable estimate of the health benefit which could be obtained with use of infusion services in each cancer indication on the waiting lists.</p><p>32.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed that while funding nab-paclitaxel may free up more resource in the health sector, many investments result in increased usage of health sector resources. The Committee agreed that it would be necessary to include either the inflated cost associated with infusion services or the QALY loss associated with their use in these instances also, for consistency.</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted cost-effectiveness analyses from overseas assessing nab-paclitaxel against paclitaxel in cancers, being <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23610525/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazzaro et al. 2013</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, Italy); <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976031/\" target=\"_blank\">Cui et al. 2020</a> (mBC, China); and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25791875/\" target=\"_blank\">Gharaibeh et al. 2015</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, UK). The Committee noted that these analyses were conducted in different contexts, with different relative prices associated with the treatment strategies.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a generic nab-paclitaxel had been approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pazenir\" target=\"_blank\">European Medicines Authority (EMA)</a> and had been considered (by regulators there) to have equivalent clinical benefits. The Committee noted that this was not currently Medsafe approved or under consideration by Medsafe at this time. The Committee noted that Pharmac staff expected that generic nab-paclitaxel will be approved for use in New Zealand in 3 to 4 years.</p>",

The Committee acknowledged the difficulties associated with modelling this, and that if a change was implemented, it would need to be applied across all applications. The Committee acknowledged that the current proposal with paclitaxel as a comparator was particularly pertinent, given paclitaxel\u2019s significant usage across New Zealand and the impacts on resource utilisation in Te Whatu Ora hospitals and subsequent impacts on individual care for other conditions.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the three groups specified for funding: anyone with mBC, people with mBC with adverse events who discontinue paclitaxel, and people with mBC with grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel.</p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel were 45% overall (any reaction) and 1 to 2% with severe reactions (ie grade 3+) despite prophylaxis with corticosteroids and H1 and H2 blockers 30 minutes prior to administration.

The Committee noted its previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>hypersensitivity reactions of any severity can occur in up to 45% of people treated with paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>10-15% of individuals experience an immediate or delayed cutaneous reaction of any severity, and 7% experience a grade 3 or 4 neuropathy reaction, likely due to the cremaphor solvent in paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>severe life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 2-4% of people, and 1 to 2% of individuals may still develop hypersensitivity reactions despite prophylactic anti-allergy medication.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in one scenario in which usage was restricted to people with severe hypersensitivity reactions, Pharmac staff had assumed that 10% of all individuals with mBC may receive nab-paclitaxel. This represents the lower bound of the 10 to 15% estimate, since it was assumed that even if 15% experienced a reaction, not all people with mild reactions would receive nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac staff had estimated the proportion with a hypersensitivity reaction in spite of prophylactic anti-allergy medication at 1.5%; a midpoint of the range provided in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered, again, that hypersensitivity reactions were caused primarily by the solvent that paclitaxel is delivered in and that these reactions are less likely to occur with the nab-paclitaxel formulation. The Committee noted its advice in July 2021 that it was a concern that 7% of people experienced neuropathy associated with paclitaxel, though considered that based on current evidence, there was a similar or slightly higher risk of neuropathy with nab-paclitaxel. However, the Committee considered that treatment-related neuropathy was highly reversible, and that rates were lower with the recommended 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose of nab-paclitaxel. The Committee considered that the other potential adverse effects occurred at similar frequencies and severity between formulations eg myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, myelosuppression, and nausea and vomiting.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction of funding for people with at least a grade 3 adverse event to apply only to those who have mBC was inequitable to people with other tumour types, and that the proposed population should be extended to any person who has a grade 3+ hypersensitivity reaction on paclitaxel therapy for any cancer type.</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction to mBC with grade 3+ hypersensitivity limited the use in anyone with grade 3+ hypersensitivity (in the curative or palliative settings and other tumour types). The Committee noted that paclitaxel is used in treating many cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, across gynaecological cancers, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cancers whose primary sources are unknown, and that funding nab-paclitaxel as an option for these further cancer types would increase the total overall time gains to paclitaxel cancer infusion service chair times and thus further reduce the overall burden on cancer infusion services.</p><p>14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that people with pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer would also benefit from nab-paclitaxel. The Committee noted that an application for nab-paclitaxel for first-line, metastatic pancreatic cancer had been ranked on the Pharmac <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/ranking-lists-for-funding-applications?reportType=OFI\" target=\"_blank\">Options For Investment</a> list. The Committee noted that Pharmac has not yet received an application for nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The Committee considered that standard treatment for ovarian cancer is paclitaxel with carboplatin, this combination having a significant (up to 10%) risk of adverse events, such that people often receive the carboplatin part of the regimen alone. The Committee considered that this carboplatin-alone option was sub-optimal, and that a future application for this group would be of interest to advise on the benefit of nab-paclitaxel for this indication.</p><h3><em>Health benefit </em></h3><p>15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, compared with paclitaxel, those who received neo-adjuvant nab-paclitaxel experienced higher pathological complete response (pCR) and invasive disease free survival (IDFS) but overall no statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS), but considered the clinical trials were underpowered to detect statistically significant effects on OS (see previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting). The Committee noted that nab-paclitaxel was under consideration as a treatment for metastatic disease in the present proposal, not as a neo-adjuvant treatment.</p><p>16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered its previous advice at the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting, which stated that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>compared with paclitaxel or docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 125 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> or 150 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> in metastatic breast cancer was reported to have a higher objective response rate (ORR) and disease-free survival (DFS)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the main benefit of nab-paclitaxel (at the currently considered 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose) was evidenced by a clinical review, which showed nab-paclitaxel\u2019s more manageable toxicity profile, with response rates maintained relative to solvent-based taxanes including paclitaxel (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465168/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin M. Breast Cancer Res. 2015; 17(1):81</a>)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the PICO table of the record of the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a> meeting reflected the findings of that clinical review and therefore stated that, for those who do not have severe hypersensitivity reactions on paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel would offer no significant difference in overall survival, progression free survival, or quality of life.</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that for those people that have a reaction to paclitaxel, treatment with nab-paclitaxel would result in a quality of life and at least progression-free survival (PFS) would improve resulting from them being able to continue treatment.</p><p>18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>However, the Committee considered that a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) benefit associated with nab-paclitaxel at the 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose may be plausible, and that a small benefit associated with improved ORR or DFS should be incorporated into cost effectiveness modelling, if material.</p><p>19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that nab-paclitaxel would only be a substitute for paclitaxel, not docetaxel, as summarised in the PICO table in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><h3><em>Suitability </em></h3><p>20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that both formulations are now given weekly as standard practice. The Committee noted its previous advice (July 2021) regarding the 30-minute time duration required to administer nab-paclitaxel but considered that 45 minutes would be allowed in practice. The Committee also noted the important difference in the chair time required for nab-paclitaxel (45 minutes allowed) and paclitaxel (2 hours total chair time allowed). The Committee considered the significant difference in the chair time was related to the administration time (30 minutes v 60 minutes) and time needed for prophylactic anti-allergy medicines prior to paclitaxel, and for those with a previous allergic reaction additional time allowed for a re-challenge.</p><p>21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the impact that the longer infusion time and other factors associated with paclitaxel has on the oncology units and use of resource (chair time) in the context of the current health system pressures., Particularly the public wait times for oncology treatment overall (all cancers, additional to metastatic breast cancer and other cancers treated with paclitaxel) and the detrimental effect of this on outcomes for these other people.</p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\"> </em><em>\u00a0</em></p><p><em>Cost and savings</em></p><p>22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that for those people who had either a severe adverse event or grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, the comparator used in modelling was gemcitabine. The Committee considered the use of gemcitabine was not standard therapy for mBC. The Committee considered that it would be more appropriate for modelling to use capecitabine or vinorelbine as the comparator in this population (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22418569/\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. Oncologist. 2012;17:476-84</a>). The Committee considered that vinorelbine and capecitabine (estimated 20% response rate after anthracycline treatment) typically have lower response rates than taxanes (estimated 40% response rate) after treatment with anthracycline. The Committee considered there were no direct head-to-head comparison studies comparing either of these agents with nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the modelling for all mBC (regardless of adverse events) did not include morbidity associated with reactions (adverse events) less than a grade 3, nor clinical resource responding to these less severe events and consequent lesser delays in treatment, affecting both the individual and others awaiting treatment. The Committee suggested that Pharmac staff should consider including these costs in their cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><h3><em>Nab-paclitaxel across all considered indications</em></h3><p>24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in general at Pharmac, health benefit from reducing costs to the health sector are included implicitly in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Namely, if Pharmac funded a treatment like nab-paclitaxel which reduced the usage of health sector resources, like infusion services, the Vote Health budget otherwise spent on those resources would be made available to spend on other health-producing services, or the scarce resources themselves would be available for use by other individuals who would benefit from them.</p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the benefit which can be obtained by releasing more oncology infusion capacity may be more than the average benefit from other health services, due to the limited resource available to administer oncology treatments. Hence, while the Committee considered that funding any specific treatment would not resolve the issues currently faced by the system, it considered that the potential health gain from making infusion capacity available should be appropriately reflected in the cost effectiveness modelling.</p><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that making health resources available for other uses could be incorporated into economic modelling by either including a higher cost associated with services which are scarce or produce a higher level of benefit than other services, or as an additional benefit, in QALYs. The Committee noted that in either case, the additional health gain associated with specific health resources would need to be sufficiently long term to be applied consistently across economic assessments over time. The Committee considered that most oncology clinics were at, or over, capacity, and there is unlikely to be a rapid increase in capacity to administer even more infusions within the public system, which means that the opportunity cost of using infusion services was likely to be a long-standing concern.</p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>To estimate the additional cost, the Committee considered that clinicians may be able to provide Pharmac with more accurate information about the cost in practice of providing certain services currently eg a higher cost of infusion services if, with such low capacity, clinical staff are being contracted at a higher wage to provide these. However, the Committee noted the sensitivity analysis presented by Pharmac staff in the technology assessment report where the cost of treatment administration was tripled for all agents, which resulted in a far greater increase for comparator treatments, which have the greatest baseline administration cost. The Committee noted the minor increase in cost utility in this scenario, in both the models for people with any severe adverse event and for people with a severe hypersensitivity reaction only. The Committee noted that this was because the administration costs displaced by nab-paclitaxel are vastly exceeded by the additional treatment cost of nab-paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Alternatively, the Committee considered that the additional people able to be treated in the public system through chair time saved by using nab-paclitaxel could be captured in the model as a numerating health benefit rather than a denominating nominal health sector cost offset saving (where Pharmac\u2019s technology assessments express summary metrics as incremental quality-adjusted life years saved (QALYs) per $1 million net health sector incremental costs (QALYs/$1million), with net health benefits as numerator and net costs as denominator). The Committee considered that the bed/chair and clinician time made available by funding nab-paclitaxel would allow more people overall to be treated by cancer infusion services and would increase the timeliness of treatment with infused medicines.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some people may not receive treatment due to the strain on infusion services currently, and that delaying the start of chemotherapy for people who do eventually receive treatment affects the outcome of that treatment eg in colorectal cancer and triple negative breast cancer treatment, it makes a substantial difference to potentially curative outcomes whether treatment starts in the first 4 weeks. The Committee estimated that the average wait for treatment administration was 6 to 8 weeks, with a 3-to-4-week initial treatment period. The Committee considered that delays in starting treatment result in loss of benefit of the treatments, in particular a 2% loss per week for breast cancer and 4% loss per week for colorectal cancer. The Committee considered that mitigating such delays (by removing the need for lengthier and potentially more problematic paclitaxel infusions and freeing chair time for other groups) was the \u2018real-world\u2019 in-practice benefit from nab-paclitaxel treatment, in addition to what the Committee considered to be the incremental benefits to the individual of nab-paclitaxel itself over paclitaxel.</p><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that these factors are considered qualitatively, but QALY gains of this sort are not included in the cost effectiveness model, because:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>infusion administration time is included in the cost effectiveness model as a denominating cost, so including time savings as a numerating benefit would double-count the impact of shorter infusions,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>capacity constraints in health services vary over time and locality, making forecasting highly uncertain, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>extensive information would be needed to estimate them, including:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the number of additional people who would now be able to receive treatment,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each individual would be expected to receive, across the gamut of cancers treated with their counterfactual health losses and converse health gains by having infused treatments more available, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each currently treated individual could receive, on average, by receiving more timely treatment.</p><p>31.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it may be feasible to acquire available data relating to the people awaiting treatment administration (including indication and therapy required) from Te Aho o Te Kahu. Members considered this would be representative of the infusion waiting lists and priority throughout the country, but that this would not be useful without a reliable estimate of the health benefit which could be obtained with use of infusion services in each cancer indication on the waiting lists.</p><p>32.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed that while funding nab-paclitaxel may free up more resource in the health sector, many investments result in increased usage of health sector resources. The Committee agreed that it would be necessary to include either the inflated cost associated with infusion services or the QALY loss associated with their use in these instances also, for consistency.</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted cost-effectiveness analyses from overseas assessing nab-paclitaxel against paclitaxel in cancers, being <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23610525/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazzaro et al. 2013</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, Italy); <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976031/\" target=\"_blank\">Cui et al. 2020</a> (mBC, China); and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25791875/\" target=\"_blank\">Gharaibeh et al. 2015</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, UK). The Committee noted that these analyses were conducted in different contexts, with different relative prices associated with the treatment strategies.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a generic nab-paclitaxel had been approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pazenir\" target=\"_blank\">European Medicines Authority (EMA)</a> and had been considered (by regulators there) to have equivalent clinical benefits. The Committee noted that this was not currently Medsafe approved or under consideration by Medsafe at this time. The Committee noted that Pharmac staff expected that generic nab-paclitaxel will be approved for use in New Zealand in 3 to 4 years.</p>",

The Committee acknowledged the difficulties associated with modelling this, and that if a change was implemented, it would need to be applied across all applications. The Committee acknowledged that the current proposal with paclitaxel as a comparator was particularly pertinent, given paclitaxel\u2019s significant usage across New Zealand and the impacts on resource utilisation in Te Whatu Ora hospitals and subsequent impacts on individual care for other conditions.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the three groups specified for funding: anyone with mBC, people with mBC with adverse events who discontinue paclitaxel, and people with mBC with grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel.</p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel were 45% overall (any reaction) and 1 to 2% with severe reactions (ie grade 3+) despite prophylaxis with corticosteroids and H1 and H2 blockers 30 minutes prior to administration. The Committee considered that prophylaxis only reduces the incidence but does not eliminate severe reactions. The Committee noted its previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>hypersensitivity reactions of any severity can occur in up to 45% of people treated with paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>10-15% of individuals experience an immediate or delayed cutaneous reaction of any severity, and 7% experience a grade 3 or 4 neuropathy reaction, likely due to the cremaphor solvent in paclitaxel,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>severe life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 2-4% of people, and 1 to 2% of individuals may still develop hypersensitivity reactions despite prophylactic anti-allergy medication.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in one scenario in which usage was restricted to people with severe hypersensitivity reactions, Pharmac staff had assumed that 10% of all individuals with mBC may receive nab-paclitaxel. This represents the lower bound of the 10 to 15% estimate, since it was assumed that even if 15% experienced a reaction, not all people with mild reactions would receive nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac staff had estimated the proportion with a hypersensitivity reaction in spite of prophylactic anti-allergy medication at 1.5%; a midpoint of the range provided in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered, again, that hypersensitivity reactions were caused primarily by the solvent that paclitaxel is delivered in and that these reactions are less likely to occur with the nab-paclitaxel formulation. The Committee noted its advice in July 2021 that it was a concern that 7% of people experienced neuropathy associated with paclitaxel, though considered that based on current evidence, there was a similar or slightly higher risk of neuropathy with nab-paclitaxel. However, the Committee considered that treatment-related neuropathy was highly reversible, and that rates were lower with the recommended 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose of nab-paclitaxel. The Committee considered that the other potential adverse effects occurred at similar frequencies and severity between formulations eg myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, myelosuppression, and nausea and vomiting.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction of funding for people with at least a grade 3 adverse event to apply only to those who have mBC was inequitable to people with other tumour types, and that the proposed population should be extended to any person who has a grade 3+ hypersensitivity reaction on paclitaxel therapy for any cancer type.</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed restriction to mBC with grade 3+ hypersensitivity limited the use in anyone with grade 3+ hypersensitivity (in the curative or palliative settings and other tumour types). The Committee noted that paclitaxel is used in treating many cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, across gynaecological cancers, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cancers whose primary sources are unknown, and that funding nab-paclitaxel as an option for these further cancer types would increase the total overall time gains to paclitaxel cancer infusion service chair times and thus further reduce the overall burden on cancer infusion services.</p><p>14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that people with pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer would also benefit from nab-paclitaxel. The Committee noted that an application for nab-paclitaxel for first-line, metastatic pancreatic cancer had been ranked on the Pharmac <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/ranking-lists-for-funding-applications?reportType=OFI\" target=\"_blank\">Options For Investment</a> list. The Committee noted that Pharmac has not yet received an application for nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The Committee considered that standard treatment for ovarian cancer is paclitaxel with carboplatin, this combination having a significant (up to 10%) risk of adverse events, such that people often receive the carboplatin part of the regimen alone. The Committee considered that this carboplatin-alone option was sub-optimal, and that a future application for this group would be of interest to advise on the benefit of nab-paclitaxel for this indication.</p><h3><em>Health benefit </em></h3><p>15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, compared with paclitaxel, those who received neo-adjuvant nab-paclitaxel experienced higher pathological complete response (pCR) and invasive disease free survival (IDFS) but overall no statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS), but considered the clinical trials were underpowered to detect statistically significant effects on OS (see previous advice from the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting). The Committee noted that nab-paclitaxel was under consideration as a treatment for metastatic disease in the present proposal, not as a neo-adjuvant treatment.</p><p>16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered its previous advice at the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP July 2021</a> meeting, which stated that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>compared with paclitaxel or docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 125 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> or 150 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> in metastatic breast cancer was reported to have a higher objective response rate (ORR) and disease-free survival (DFS)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the main benefit of nab-paclitaxel (at the currently considered 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose) was evidenced by a clinical review, which showed nab-paclitaxel\u2019s more manageable toxicity profile, with response rates maintained relative to solvent-based taxanes including paclitaxel (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465168/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin M. Breast Cancer Res. 2015; 17(1):81</a>)</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the PICO table of the record of the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a> meeting reflected the findings of that clinical review and therefore stated that, for those who do not have severe hypersensitivity reactions on paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel would offer no significant difference in overall survival, progression free survival, or quality of life.</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that for those people that have a reaction to paclitaxel, treatment with nab-paclitaxel would result in a quality of life and at least progression-free survival (PFS) would improve resulting from them being able to continue treatment.</p><p>18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>However, the Committee considered that a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) benefit associated with nab-paclitaxel at the 100 mg/m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> dose may be plausible, and that a small benefit associated with improved ORR or DFS should be incorporated into cost effectiveness modelling, if material.</p><p>19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that nab-paclitaxel would only be a substitute for paclitaxel, not docetaxel, as summarised in the PICO table in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2021</a>.</p><h3><em>Suitability </em></h3><p>20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that both formulations are now given weekly as standard practice. The Committee noted its previous advice (July 2021) regarding the 30-minute time duration required to administer nab-paclitaxel but considered that 45 minutes would be allowed in practice. The Committee also noted the important difference in the chair time required for nab-paclitaxel (45 minutes allowed) and paclitaxel (2 hours total chair time allowed). The Committee considered the significant difference in the chair time was related to the administration time (30 minutes v 60 minutes) and time needed for prophylactic anti-allergy medicines prior to paclitaxel, and for those with a previous allergic reaction additional time allowed for a re-challenge.</p><p>21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the impact that the longer infusion time and other factors associated with paclitaxel has on the oncology units and use of resource (chair time) in the context of the current health system pressures., Particularly the public wait times for oncology treatment overall (all cancers, additional to metastatic breast cancer and other cancers treated with paclitaxel) and the detrimental effect of this on outcomes for these other people.</p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\"> </em><em>\u00a0</em></p><p><em>Cost and savings</em></p><p>22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that for those people who had either a severe adverse event or grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, the comparator used in modelling was gemcitabine. The Committee considered the use of gemcitabine was not standard therapy for mBC. The Committee considered that it would be more appropriate for modelling to use capecitabine or vinorelbine as the comparator in this population (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22418569/\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. Oncologist. 2012;17:476-84</a>). The Committee considered that vinorelbine and capecitabine (estimated 20% response rate after anthracycline treatment) typically have lower response rates than taxanes (estimated 40% response rate) after treatment with anthracycline. The Committee considered there were no direct head-to-head comparison studies comparing either of these agents with nab-paclitaxel.</p><p>23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the modelling for all mBC (regardless of adverse events) did not include morbidity associated with reactions (adverse events) less than a grade 3, nor clinical resource responding to these less severe events and consequent lesser delays in treatment, affecting both the individual and others awaiting treatment. The Committee suggested that Pharmac staff should consider including these costs in their cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><h3><em>Nab-paclitaxel across all considered indications</em></h3><p>24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in general at Pharmac, health benefit from reducing costs to the health sector are included implicitly in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Namely, if Pharmac funded a treatment like nab-paclitaxel which reduced the usage of health sector resources, like infusion services, the Vote Health budget otherwise spent on those resources would be made available to spend on other health-producing services, or the scarce resources themselves would be available for use by other individuals who would benefit from them.</p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the benefit which can be obtained by releasing more oncology infusion capacity may be more than the average benefit from other health services, due to the limited resource available to administer oncology treatments. Hence, while the Committee considered that funding any specific treatment would not resolve the issues currently faced by the system, it considered that the potential health gain from making infusion capacity available should be appropriately reflected in the cost effectiveness modelling.</p><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that making health resources available for other uses could be incorporated into economic modelling by either including a higher cost associated with services which are scarce or produce a higher level of benefit than other services, or as an additional benefit, in QALYs. The Committee noted that in either case, the additional health gain associated with specific health resources would need to be sufficiently long term to be applied consistently across economic assessments over time. The Committee considered that most oncology clinics were at, or over, capacity, and there is unlikely to be a rapid increase in capacity to administer even more infusions within the public system, which means that the opportunity cost of using infusion services was likely to be a long-standing concern.</p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>To estimate the additional cost, the Committee considered that clinicians may be able to provide Pharmac with more accurate information about the cost in practice of providing certain services currently eg a higher cost of infusion services if, with such low capacity, clinical staff are being contracted at a higher wage to provide these. However, the Committee noted the sensitivity analysis presented by Pharmac staff in the technology assessment report where the cost of treatment administration was tripled for all agents, which resulted in a far greater increase for comparator treatments, which have the greatest baseline administration cost. The Committee noted the minor increase in cost utility in this scenario, in both the models for people with any severe adverse event and for people with a severe hypersensitivity reaction only. The Committee noted that this was because the administration costs displaced by nab-paclitaxel are vastly exceeded by the additional treatment cost of nab-paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Alternatively, the Committee considered that the additional people able to be treated in the public system through chair time saved by using nab-paclitaxel could be captured in the model as a numerating health benefit rather than a denominating nominal health sector cost offset saving (where Pharmac\u2019s technology assessments express summary metrics as incremental quality-adjusted life years saved (QALYs) per $1 million net health sector incremental costs (QALYs/$1million), with net health benefits as numerator and net costs as denominator). The Committee considered that the bed/chair and clinician time made available by funding nab-paclitaxel would allow more people overall to be treated by cancer infusion services and would increase the timeliness of treatment with infused medicines.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some people may not receive treatment due to the strain on infusion services currently, and that delaying the start of chemotherapy for people who do eventually receive treatment affects the outcome of that treatment eg in colorectal cancer and triple negative breast cancer treatment, it makes a substantial difference to potentially curative outcomes whether treatment starts in the first 4 weeks. The Committee estimated that the average wait for treatment administration was 6 to 8 weeks, with a 3-to-4-week initial treatment period. The Committee considered that delays in starting treatment result in loss of benefit of the treatments, in particular a 2% loss per week for breast cancer and 4% loss per week for colorectal cancer. The Committee considered that mitigating such delays (by removing the need for lengthier and potentially more problematic paclitaxel infusions and freeing chair time for other groups) was the \u2018real-world\u2019 in-practice benefit from nab-paclitaxel treatment, in addition to what the Committee considered to be the incremental benefits to the individual of nab-paclitaxel itself over paclitaxel.</p><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that these factors are considered qualitatively, but QALY gains of this sort are not included in the cost effectiveness model, because:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>infusion administration time is included in the cost effectiveness model as a denominating cost, so including time savings as a numerating benefit would double-count the impact of shorter infusions,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>capacity constraints in health services vary over time and locality, making forecasting highly uncertain, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">30.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>extensive information would be needed to estimate them, including:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the number of additional people who would now be able to receive treatment,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each individual would be expected to receive, across the gamut of cancers treated with their counterfactual health losses and converse health gains by having infused treatments more available, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-2\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the magnitude of clinical benefit each currently treated individual could receive, on average, by receiving more timely treatment.</p><p>31.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it may be feasible to acquire available data relating to the people awaiting treatment administration (including indication and therapy required) from Te Aho o Te Kahu. Members considered this would be representative of the infusion waiting lists and priority throughout the country, but that this would not be useful without a reliable estimate of the health benefit which could be obtained with use of infusion services in each cancer indication on the waiting lists.</p><p>32.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed that while funding nab-paclitaxel may free up more resource in the health sector, many investments result in increased usage of health sector resources. The Committee agreed that it would be necessary to include either the inflated cost associated with infusion services or the QALY loss associated with their use in these instances also, for consistency.</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted cost-effectiveness analyses from overseas assessing nab-paclitaxel against paclitaxel in cancers, being <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23610525/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazzaro et al. 2013</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, Italy); <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976031/\" target=\"_blank\">Cui et al. 2020</a> (mBC, China); and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25791875/\" target=\"_blank\">Gharaibeh et al. 2015</a> (metastatic pancreatic cancer, UK). The Committee noted that these analyses were conducted in different contexts, with different relative prices associated with the treatment strategies.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a generic nab-paclitaxel had been approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pazenir\" target=\"_blank\">European Medicines Authority (EMA)</a> and had been considered (by regulators there) to have equivalent clinical benefits. The Committee noted that this was not currently Medsafe approved or under consideration by Medsafe at this time. The Committee noted that Pharmac staff expected that generic nab-paclitaxel will be approved for use in New Zealand in 3 to 4 years.</p>",
