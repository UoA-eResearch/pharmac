<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>

6,"<p>We refer to our decisions about whether and how particular pharmaceuticals are publicly-funded, as &ldquo;funding decisions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We consider and assess all funding decisions using the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/about/operating-policies-and-procedures/#factorsfc"" rel=""nofollow"">Factors for Consideration</a>. When we do so, we carefully evaluate clinical and other evidence for the benefits and suitability of a proposal, and to identify and understand the people who will be affected by it.</p>
<p>While our main task is to allocate pharmaceutical funding, we consider the benefits and costs across the whole health system now and with a long-term focus, including the effects for hospitals and primary care, and consider direct costs to patients as well as to all health sector budgets.</p>
<p>Final funding decisions are made by the Pharmac Board or delegated to senior Pharmac staff as required by the Board.</p>
