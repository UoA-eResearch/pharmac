The Committee considered that an additional 300 mg dose at week 10 may be considered in patients who received suboptimal response after induction therapy.

The Committee noted that, following failure of steroid treatment to manage symptoms, patients may be initiated on immunomodulators such as azathioprine, or TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment for patients who have not responded to corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, or have experienced an adverse event or become unable to tolerate corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The Committee noted that calcineurin inhibitors are not a feature of New Zealand clinical practice in the treatment of IBD but are used internationally. The Committee noted that for patients for whom biologic therapy does not elicit a response, surgical resection is an option, with more favourable long-term outcomes typically seen in ulcerative colitis patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that more data is needed on whether early aggressive therapy is more beneficial than a step-up treatment approach in the longer term for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly with regard to whether early aggressive therapy has a role in altering the natural history of the disease.\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that the majority of Crohn\u2019s disease patients are treated with adalimumab as their first biologic agent, with infliximab used first line in approximately 10-15% of cases. The Committee considered that infliximab is the most common initial biologic agent for patients presenting to hospital with acute Crohn\u2019s disease such as those presenting with fistulising disease. The Committee noted that approximately half of Crohn\u2019s disease patients who experience primary non-response to a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor are likely to experience the same with a second TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, and 23% to 46% of those with prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment failure are likely to experience treatment failure (secondary loss of response) to a second TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor at 12 months (Ben-Horin et al. Autoimmun Rev. 2014;13:24-30).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the health need for the IBD patient population is high. Members noted that children and adolescents presenting with IBD are more likely to be diagnosed with severe disease but are less likely to have the complications seen in adult patients such as fistulae, abscesses, and strictures that are associated with longer duration disease (Jakobsen et al. Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2011;34:1217-24; Duricova et al. J Crohns Colitis. 2014;8:1351-61). Children with ulcerative colitis have more extensive disease after presentation, a higher risk of being treated with systemic steroids and azathioprine\u2044 mercaptopurine, a higher frequency of steroid dependency and a more severe disease course.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that a non-experimental study investigating the health care utilisation and cost for ulcerative colitis in Australia (Gibson et al.

Additionally, the Committee noted that ulcerative colitis patients have a lower health related quality of life than the general population, and that the most important treatment attribute was efficacy, but that patients also value avoiding steroids, and prefer a fast onset of effect (Hagelund et al. Curr Med Res Opin. 2020;36:771-779).

The Committee considered it was quite common to exhaust funded treatments within the same class before shifting out of class to a biologic with an alternative mechanism of action and considered that vedolizumab is commonly used overseas after the failure of two prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there should be no age restriction in the funding criteria for vedolizumab for Crohn\u2019s disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>General</p><p>The Committee noted that since the introduction of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, the need for and rates of surgery for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients has decreased substantially. The Committee also noted that the pivotal trials for vedolizumab did not show a reduction in surgery rates compared with placebo, and thus considered that longer term follow-up may be required to determine the impact of vedolizumab treatment (and/or other biological treatments) on surgical rates. The Committee considered that the greatest benefit from funding vedolizumab would be increased symptom control and improvement in quality of life measures, and that an appropriate comparator for vedolizumab is adalimumab and/or infliximab.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that information on the duration of treatment, stopping points for treatment, use of endoscopy, and use of combination therapy was missing from the clinical trial data and commentary submitted by the applicant.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee suggested that the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee review the application for vedolizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and provide expert advice on the VARSITY trial evidence (not yet reviewed by the Subcommittee), and the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in this setting.</p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>PTAC and PTAC Subcommittees may differ in the advice they provide to PHARMAC, including recommendations\u2019 priority, due to the committees\u2019 different, albeit complementary, roles, expertise, experience, and perspectives.</p><p><br></p><p>Vedolizumab</p><p>The Committee noted that vedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which selectively binds to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin on T-lymphocytes that are present in the gastrointestinal tract and cause characteristic inflammation in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee noted vedolizumabs binds selectively to the integrin unique to the bowel, resulting in a gut-specific mechanism of action. The Committee considered that this gut specificity may be associated with a reduction in systemic side effects, however, may similarly result in a limited effect of vedolizumab on the prevention and management of extraintestinal manifestations associated with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that vedolizumab is proposed to be used for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or severe Crohn\u2019s disease who have experienced either inadequate response, intolerable side effects, or loss of response with the currently available TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors The Committee noted vedolizumab induction therapy is typically given as 300 mg initially and at week two, with maintenance dosing of 300 mg at week six, then every eight weeks. The Committee considered that an additional 300 mg dose at week 10 may be considered in patients who received suboptimal response after induction therapy. The Committee noted that all doses (induction and maintenance) are administered via IV infusion over a period of approximately 30 minutes in a hospital setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in March 2017, the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee considered the clinician application for vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis who have either had failure of, become refractory to, or experienced severe and intractable side effects from TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment(s) and:</p><p>1.\tRecommended that vedolizumab be funded for Crohn\u2019s disease, in a first line setting if cost neutral with infliximab and adalimumab if a registered product becomes available; and\u00a0</p><p>2.\tRecommended that vedolizumab be funded for Crohn\u2019s disease, in a second line setting with a high priority for primary non-responders to infliximab, if a registered product becomes available; and</p><p>3.\tRecommended that vedolizumab be funded for ulcerative colitis, in a first line setting if cost neutral with infliximab if a registered product becomes available; and</p><p>4.\tRecommended that vedolizumab be funded for ulcerative colitis, in a second line setting with a high priority for primary and secondary non-responders to infliximab, if a registered product becomes available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in November 2017, PTAC noted that vedolizumab was neither registered nor sought for registration in New Zealand, and noted that PHARMAC intended to invite Takeda (the supplier of vedolizumab) to submit an application for funding. At that time, PTAC requested it review the evidence from the supplier when applications were made for funding and registration in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in February 2019, PTAC noted that PHARMAC had undertaken an economic analysis for vedolizumab and the proposal had been ranked against other proposals. At that time, PTAC recommended that it be presented a full paper on vedolizumab, and that it could reconsider its advice on vedolizumab, following that paper.</p><p><br></p><p>Health need\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that the current treatment paradigm for management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) i.e. patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, typically begins with aminosalicylates and escalates to steroid treatment if patients experience flare-ups and disease progression. The Committee noted that, following failure of steroid treatment to manage symptoms, patients may be initiated on immunomodulators such as azathioprine, or TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment for patients who have not responded to corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, or have experienced an adverse event or become unable to tolerate corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The Committee noted that calcineurin inhibitors are not a feature of New Zealand clinical practice in the treatment of IBD but are used internationally. The Committee noted that for patients for whom biologic therapy does not elicit a response, surgical resection is an option, with more favourable long-term outcomes typically seen in ulcerative colitis patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that more data is needed on whether early aggressive therapy is more beneficial than a step-up treatment approach in the longer term for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly with regard to whether early aggressive therapy has a role in altering the natural history of the disease.\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that the majority of Crohn\u2019s disease patients are treated with adalimumab as their first biologic agent, with infliximab used first line in approximately 10-15% of cases. The Committee considered that infliximab is the most common initial biologic agent for patients presenting to hospital with acute Crohn\u2019s disease such as those presenting with fistulising disease. The Committee noted that approximately half of Crohn\u2019s disease patients who experience primary non-response to a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor are likely to experience the same with a second TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, and 23% to 46% of those with prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment failure are likely to experience treatment failure (secondary loss of response) to a second TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor at 12 months (Ben-Horin et al. Autoimmun Rev. 2014;13:24-30).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the health need for the IBD patient population is high. Members noted that children and adolescents presenting with IBD are more likely to be diagnosed with severe disease but are less likely to have the complications seen in adult patients such as fistulae, abscesses, and strictures that are associated with longer duration disease (Jakobsen et al. Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2011;34:1217-24; Duricova et al. J Crohns Colitis. 2014;8:1351-61). Children with ulcerative colitis have more extensive disease after presentation, a higher risk of being treated with systemic steroids and azathioprine\u2044 mercaptopurine, a higher frequency of steroid dependency and a more severe disease course.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that a non-experimental study investigating the health care utilisation and cost for ulcerative colitis in Australia (Gibson et al. J Crohns Colitis. 2014;8:598-606). The Committee noted that the mean (SD) 3-month UC-related health care cost per patient was reported as AUD $2914 ($3447); with mean for patients in remission, $1970; mild disease, $3736; and moderate/severe disease, $4162; and that patients in remission had the least work and activity impairment. Additionally, the Committee noted that ulcerative colitis patients have a lower health related quality of life than the general population, and that the most important treatment attribute was efficacy, but that patients also value avoiding steroids, and prefer a fast onset of effect (Hagelund et al. Curr Med Res Opin. 2020;36:771-779). The Committee considered that the health system costs, and quality of life impacts would be similar for Crohn\u2019s disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Evidence for vedolizumab in Crohn\u2019s disease\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted the results of the double-blind, placebo-controlled GEMINI II induction and maintenance trials of 829 patients with Crohn\u2019s disease; in the induction trial, patients received either intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg (N=220) or placebo (N=148) at weeks 0 and 2, and 747 patients received open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2. The Committee noted that in the maintenance phase, patients received 300 mg vedolizumab 4-weekly (N=154), 8-weekly (N=154) or placebo (N=153) (Sandborn et al. N Engl J Med 2013; 369:711-21).\u00a0</p><p>\u2022\tThe Committee noted that, in the induction phase, 31.4% of the patients receiving vedolizumab achieved a clinical response, compared with 25.7% in the placebo treatment arm at week 6 (p=0.23). The Committee also noted that, 14.5% of the vedolizumab group and 6.8% of the placebo group achieved clinical remission at week 6 (P=0.02). Of the patients receiving open label vedolizumab, 17.7% achieved clinical remission and 34.4% had a clinical response at week 6.\u00a0</p><p>\u2022\tThe Committee noted that, in the induction phase, 39.0% of patients receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks and 36.4% receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks achieved clinical remission, compared with 21.6% of patients receiving placebo at week 52 (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.004 for the comparison of the two vedolizumab groups, respectively, with placebo). The Committee noted that patients were not stratified by previous TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor exposure</p><p>\u2022\tThe Committee noted that the results from GEMINI II were similar to those seen in a 2018 meta-analysis where the rates of corticosteroid-free remission was 25% at week 14 (95%, CI 20% to 31%) and 31% at month 12 (95%, CI 20% to 45%) (Schreiber et al. J Gastroenterol. 2018;53:1048-1064).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the double-blind, placebo-controlled GEMINI III trial of 416 patients with Crohn\u2019s disease in whom previous therapy with a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor had failed were given 300 mg of vedolizumab (N=209) or placebo (N=207) intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6 (Sands et al. Gastroenterology 2014; 147(3): 618-27). The Committee noted that, at week 6, among patients with prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor failure, 15.2% achieved clinical remission in the vedolizumab group compared with 12.1% in the placebo group (P=0.433). The Committee noted that a clinical response was achieved in 39.2% of vedolizumab patients compared with 22.3% of the placebo patients (P=0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, among patients na\u00efve to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor treatment, remission occurred in 31.4% of the vedolizumab group compared with 12.0% in the placebo group. The Committee also noted that clinical response was achieved in 39.2% of the vedolizumab group compared with 24.0% of the placebo group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, at week ten, among patients with prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor failure, 26.6% achieved clinical remission in the vedolizumab group compared with 12.1% in the placebo group (P=0.001). The Committee noted that a clinical response was achieved in 46.8% of vedolizumab patients compared with 24.8% of the placebo patients (P=0.001). The Committee also noted that among patients na\u00efve to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, clinical remission was 35.3% for vedolizumab compared with 16.0% with placebo, and clinical response was 51.0% with vedolizumab compared with 22.0% with placebo.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a study performed at five hospitals in Paris comparing vedolizumab to ustekinumab in 239 patients with Crohn\u2019s disease that have not responded to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy (Alric et al. Aliment Pharmacol Therap.2020;51:948-57). The Committee noted that at week 14, the rate of clinical remission was similar between vedolizumab and ustekinumab (46.1% vs 42.3%; OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.50, P=0.59), but that at week 48 ustekinumab was associated with a higher clinical remission rate (54.4% vs 38.3%; OR=1.92, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.39, P = 0.03) and treatment persistence (71.5% vs 49.7%; OR=2.54, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.62], P&lt;0.01) than vedolizumab. The Committee considered that results from both treatments were good results in the context of treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease. Members considered that the study used a robust definition for steroid-free remission and that similar results were reported for this outcome.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Suitability\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that the infusion duration for intravenous administration of vedolizumab is shorter than that of infliximab, and that vedolizumab does not require treatment in combination with immunosuppressants e.g. thiopurines.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that some wastage could be expected with vedolizumab e.g. due to lower doses for children) The Committee considered that if effective, treatment with vedolizumab would likely be long-term due to its long duration of effect. The Committee considered that the loss of response with vedolizumab is less than 10% per year, and this is likely lower than the 13-15% loss of response per year observed with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that if a subcutaneous vedolizumab formulation were available, it would enable administration in the community and self-administration, however, it may require more frequent administration than the intravenous formulation.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Uptake of vedolizumab in Crohn\u2019s disease.</p><p>The Committee considered that approximately 46% of patients with Crohn\u2019s have disease that is refractory to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy. The Committee considered that there is likely to be a small prevalent pool of patients initiating vedolizumab shortly after listing, and this prevalent pool is likely to be larger in Crohn\u2019s disease than in ulcerative colitis. The Committee considered that the estimated uptake and number of patients (who may be eligible for vedolizumab as a second-line treatment for severe Crohn\u2019s disease) of approximately 280 equivalent full-year patients in year 1, rising to 420 in three years was reasonable. The Committee considered that the rate of failure of maintenance therapy with vedolizumab was likely to be less than that of infliximab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered there was some uncertainty around how many patients would use vedolizumab after the failure of one TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (instead of a second anti-TNF), and considered it is possible that up to 50% could use vedolizumab as an alternative to a second TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor. The Committee considered it was quite common to exhaust funded treatments within the same class before shifting out of class to a biologic with an alternative mechanism of action and considered that vedolizumab is commonly used overseas after the failure of two prior TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there should be no age restriction in the funding criteria for vedolizumab for Crohn\u2019s disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>General</p><p>The Committee noted that since the introduction of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, the need for and rates of surgery for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients has decreased substantially. The Committee also noted that the pivotal trials for vedolizumab did not show a reduction in surgery rates compared with placebo, and thus considered that longer term follow-up may be required to determine the impact of vedolizumab treatment (and/or other biological treatments) on surgical rates. The Committee considered that the greatest benefit from funding vedolizumab would be increased symptom control and improvement in quality of life measures, and that an appropriate comparator for vedolizumab is adalimumab and/or infliximab.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that information on the duration of treatment, stopping points for treatment, use of endoscopy, and use of combination therapy was missing from the clinical trial data and commentary submitted by the applicant.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee suggested that the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee review the application for vedolizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and provide expert advice on the VARSITY trial evidence (not yet reviewed by the Subcommittee), and the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in this setting.</p>",
