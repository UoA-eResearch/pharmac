The Committee noted that this poisoning can occur in adults or children\u00a0and these patients may present to an Emergency Department) or General Practitioner\u00a0as individual cases or as multiple cases at a time (considered to be an \u2018outbreak\u2019).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the metabolites of ethylene glycol or methanol are toxic,\u00a0rapidly lead to metabolic acidosis, and can cause damage to the kidneys, eyes\u00a0(potentially causing blindness), central nervous system (CNS), cardiopulmonary system,\u00a0and in many cases results in death.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant estimates that there are approximately 28 cases\u00a0of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning per year in New Zealand, based on data of\u00a0contacts with the National Poisons Centre (NPC) and information downloads from the\u00a0poison information website, TOXINZ. The Committee considered these data sources\u00a0may not capture all cases because experienced clinicians may not need to seek advice\u00a0from the NPC or TOXINZ; and that Emergency Department physicians should be\u00a0contacted to clarify patient numbers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant provided hospital discharge data from 2015 to\u00a02016 for patients who received publicly funded hospital treatment for poisoning (not only\u00a0due to ethylene glycol or methanol) and that of 71 patients discharged, 22 were M\u0101ori\u00a0and 3 were Pacific people, suggesting there may be disproportionate incidence in M\u0101ori.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the current treatment for ethylene glycol or methanol\u00a0poisoning in New Zealand consists of controlled intoxication with high doses of medical\u00a0ethanol, intravenously administered in intensive care units (ICU) sometimes over several\u00a0days and monitored by frequent testing of ethanol concentration and metabolic status\u00a0(including pH and bicarbonate levels).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that ethanol is funded without restriction, readily available\u00a0and its therapeutic use is well known. The Committee noted that ethanol blocks\u00a0metabolism of ethylene glycol or methanol which is instead excreted in urine. Members\u00a0considered there are some concerns about whether the continuous infusion of ethanol\u00a0over several days can cause CNS damage.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that intubation (for patients with compromised airways) or\u00a0haemodialysis (to assist with removal of agents or metabolites) may be required in some\u00a0cases and considered that treatment which prevents metabolite formation could reduce\u00a0or prevent the need for haemodialysis.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that management of patients being treated with ethanol can\u00a0be challenging due to behavioural disturbances resulting from the induced ethanol\u00a0intoxication and the need for intubation in some patients, which places a considerable\u00a0demand on limited ICU beds.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Committee noted that poisoning from ethylene glycol or methanol results from\u00a0deliberate or accidental ingestion of products containing these agents (such as\u00a0antifreeze or windscreen fluid) or where they are used as an ethanol substitute (such as\u00a0moonshine). The Committee noted that this poisoning can occur in adults or children\u00a0and these patients may present to an Emergency Department) or General Practitioner\u00a0as individual cases or as multiple cases at a time (considered to be an \u2018outbreak\u2019).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the metabolites of ethylene glycol or methanol are toxic,\u00a0rapidly lead to metabolic acidosis, and can cause damage to the kidneys, eyes\u00a0(potentially causing blindness), central nervous system (CNS), cardiopulmonary system,\u00a0and in many cases results in death.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant estimates that there are approximately 28 cases\u00a0of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning per year in New Zealand, based on data of\u00a0contacts with the National Poisons Centre (NPC) and information downloads from the\u00a0poison information website, TOXINZ. The Committee considered these data sources\u00a0may not capture all cases because experienced clinicians may not need to seek advice\u00a0from the NPC or TOXINZ; and that Emergency Department physicians should be\u00a0contacted to clarify patient numbers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant provided hospital discharge data from 2015 to\u00a02016 for patients who received publicly funded hospital treatment for poisoning (not only\u00a0due to ethylene glycol or methanol) and that of 71 patients discharged, 22 were M\u0101ori\u00a0and 3 were Pacific people, suggesting there may be disproportionate incidence in M\u0101ori.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the current treatment for ethylene glycol or methanol\u00a0poisoning in New Zealand consists of controlled intoxication with high doses of medical\u00a0ethanol, intravenously administered in intensive care units (ICU) sometimes over several\u00a0days and monitored by frequent testing of ethanol concentration and metabolic status\u00a0(including pH and bicarbonate levels).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that ethanol is funded without restriction, readily available\u00a0and its therapeutic use is well known. The Committee noted that ethanol blocks\u00a0metabolism of ethylene glycol or methanol which is instead excreted in urine. Members\u00a0considered there are some concerns about whether the continuous infusion of ethanol\u00a0over several days can cause CNS damage.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that intubation (for patients with compromised airways) or\u00a0haemodialysis (to assist with removal of agents or metabolites) may be required in some\u00a0cases and considered that treatment which prevents metabolite formation could reduce\u00a0or prevent the need for haemodialysis.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that management of patients being treated with ethanol can\u00a0be challenging due to behavioural disturbances resulting from the induced ethanol\u00a0intoxication and the need for intubation in some patients, which places a considerable\u00a0demand on limited ICU beds. Members also considered it is challenging to treat patients\u00a0with poisoning in rural areas with an ethanol infusion.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol\u00a0dehydrogenase and that it is administered over 30 minutes every 12 hours by\u00a0intravenous infusion in a hospital setting until the patient\u2019s ethylene glycol or methanol\u00a0concentration is reduced below 20 mg per dL, symptoms have resolved, and pH has\u00a0normalised.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that fomepizole would likely require less intensive patient\u00a0monitoring than ethanol.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that fomepizole was approved by Medsafe in December 2018 for\u00a0use as an antidote for ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning or for their suspected\u00a0ingestion, with or without haemodialysis, and that fomepizole is included on the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World\u00a0Health Organisation (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines.</a>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant provided the published results of two\u00a0prospective observational clinical studies in patients with ethylene glycol poisoning\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10080845\" target=\"_blank\">Brent et al. N Engl J Med. 1999;340:832-8</a>) and with methanol poisoning (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11172179\" target=\"_blank\">Brent et al. N\u00a0Engl J Med. 2001;344:424-9</a>). The Committee noted that these trials did not include\u00a0control groups and were of low to moderate quality regarding adverse effects (rated\u00a0according to the GRADE approach), however, the Committee considered that this\u00a0evidence showed that fomepizole was effective in normalising acid-base status.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was unclear whether the adverse events (AEs)\u00a0reported in each of the two studies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10080845\" target=\"_blank\">Brent et al.

N Engl J Med. 2001;344:424-9</a>) were related to fomepizole treatment or if they were\u00a0due to the poisoning. The Committee noted the authors reported cardiovascular AEs in\u00a0patients who received fomepizole and considered that these were concerning for\u00a0patients with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning who have considerable morbidity.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a retrospective observational case series assessing\u00a0risk factors related to poor outcome in 203 patients with methanol poisoning (of which\u00a032 received fomepizole) reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22992104\" target=\"_blank\">Paasma et al. (Clin Toxicol (Philia). 2012;50:823-31</a>). The Committee considered the results showed that low pH, coma and inadequate\u00a0hyperventilation on admission were strong predictors of poor outcome. The Committee\u00a0also noted that the authors suggest ethanol and fomepizole are equally effective\u00a0treatments, but the practical disadvantages of ethanol can affect its efficacy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a retrospective study of 172 patients hospitalised\u00a0between 1996 and 2005 for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18639955\" target=\"_blank\">Lepik et al. Ann\u00a0Emerg Med. 2009;53:439-50</a>). The Committee noted that the authors report more AEs\u00a0occurred in patients who received ethanol (57%) than in patients who received\u00a0fomepizole (12%), and that there were more severe or life-threatening AEs in patients\u00a0receiving ethanol (20% and 8% respectively) than with fomepizole (5% and 2%\u00a0respectively).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of fomepizole in\u00a0healthy volunteers which were reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554311\" target=\"_blank\">McMartin et al. Clin Toxicol (Philia).\u00a02012;50:375-83</a>) in which the authors suggest, based on their results, that patients\u00a0require an increased dose of fomepizole after 36 hours. The Committee considered this\u00a0dosing regimen would be relevant to the cost of funding fomepizole.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the results of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic study\u00a0which investigated relative exposures of fomepizole and alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme\u00a0activity (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15716481\" target=\"_blank\">Corley and McMartin. Toxicol Sci. 2005;85:491-501</a>). The Committee\u00a0considered that the authors reported that the effect of fomepizole on alcohol\u00a0dehydrogenase was not clearly correlated with outcome, although theoretically it should\u00a0be.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted the AE data provided from two randomised, unblinded studies of\u00a0fomepizole in healthy volunteers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3056073\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobsen et al. Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1988;12:516-22</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2212566\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobsen et al. J Emerg Med. 1990;8:455-61</a>). The Committee noted the authors\u00a0reported gastrointestinal, CNS, cardiovascular and metabolic AEs with fomepizole.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a case series of 38 patients with ethylene glycol\u00a0poisoning reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10485727\" target=\"_blank\">Borron et al. (Lancet. 1999;354:831</a>), which suggest that\u00a0fomepizole is effective and safe treatment, especially if administered early, and that\u00a0fomepizole alone is sufficient therapy for patients with normal renal function and normal\u00a0acid-base status.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the evidence provided in the application to list fomepizole on\u00a0the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/\" target=\"_blank\">WHO Model List of Essential Medicines</a> and considered that this provided\u00a0reasonable evidence for fomepizole in this indication.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that evidence indicated that fomepizole had a different but\u00a0not necessarily better AE profile compared to ethanol. The Committee considered that\u00a0while there were fewer toxicities reported with use of fomepizole, significant AEs\u00a0(including cardiovascular AEs) were reported in patients receiving fomepizole.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for fomepizole was of poor quality and\u00a0strength which made it difficult to draw conclusions about the benefit of fomepizole\u00a0compared to ethanol. The Committee considered that the retrospective nature of the\u00a0data provided some long-term data on outcomes and limited reporting of AEs, although\u00a0members were uncertain of the accuracy of comparing AE data across studies.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it unlikely that there will be high-quality evidence from\u00a0randomised controlled trials of ethanol compared to fomepizole in patients with ethylene\u00a0glycol or methanol poisoning in future, due to the challenges in research in patients with\u00a0this poisoning, since fomepizole appears to have been used preferentially for very unwell\u00a0patients in some trials, and because it has already been adopted globally.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that fomepizole had similar efficacy to ethanol and that it was\u00a0likely that fomepizole would benefit patients who present with severe poisoning. The\u00a0Committee considered that the evidence suggests fomepizole may reduce health\u00a0resource use in patients with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, however, it is\u00a0unclear whether fomepizole would reduce the costs of managing these patients.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that health resource costs are influenced by whether patients with\u00a0ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning require care in an ICU or a high-dependency unit\u00a0(HDU), and whether intubation or haemodialysis is required.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that specialist advice should be sought from groups such as\u00a0intensive care unit physicians, emergency department physicians, toxicologists and\u00a0professional bodies (such as the Australasian Society of Clinical and Experimental\u00a0Pharmacologists and Toxicologists (ASCEPT)) regarding the number of patients\u00a0presenting with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, and whether the availability of\u00a0fomepizole would alter patient management or reduce the use of health sector resource\u00a0as compared to ethanol in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the priority of\u00a0its recommendation for fomepizole should be reconsidered in light of the above\u00a0information if its use would not reduce health sector costs.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the reduced monitoring requirements with administration of\u00a0fomepizole (compared to ethanol which requires regular frequent measurements of\u00a0metabolic status and ethanol concentration) could mean a preference for its use as a\u00a0first-line treatment in all patients. Members considered that clinicians may look to initiate\u00a0treatment with fomepizole on suspicion of poisoning, rather than delaying treatment until\u00a0diagnosis is confirmed. Members noted that the proposed restriction criteria was\u00a0generally in line with the TOXINZ indications for treatment with ethanol or fomepizole.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the dose regimen of fomepizole, including an increased\u00a0dose after 36 hours, should be a consideration for cost sensitivity analysis.\u00a0</p>",

This was because there was considerable uncertainty that any patients would not be admitted to ICU irrespective of antidote administered.

The Committee considered that no study was designed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments, and that the evidence was heterogenous, confounded by other factors, and subject to biases (eg missing data and publication bias). However, the Committee considered that higher quality evidence would not be expected to eventuate and considered that the available evidence supported use of fomepizole with reported efficacy at least equivalent to that of ethanol. The Committee noted that there is no evidence that fomepizole would reduce patient time in intensive care units (ICU) or reduce the need for dialysis. The Committee considered that the ease of fomepizole administration and its reduced adverse event profile compared to ethanol were the most relevant outcomes for Pharmac assessment. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to align with international guidance documents that reflect use of fomepizole as international best practice for this indication given the evidence base.</p><h2><strong><em>Suitability</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the shelf life of fomepizole is 60 months and considered that its ease of administration would enable treatment to be initiated in smaller centres, although patients would be expected to require admission to ICU even if fomepizole were used. The Committee noted that fomepizole has treatment delivery benefits over ethanol and a potential benefit for rural patients via increasing equity of access to care.</p><h2><strong><em>Costs and Savings</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that fomepizole would be stocked in all Emergency Departments and in remote rural clinics, however, it was difficult to determine likely total stock levels, usage and wastage (ie. due to expiry of most stock before use) across the country. The Committee considered that the risk of slippage was small as fomepizole is unlikely to be used in paracetamol overdoses (most cases being mild and associated with a low incidence of consequent liver toxicity). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the significant cost of ethanol treatment for methylene glycol or ethanol poisoning, however, considered that its view had not changed regarding the potential savings with fomepizole from a reduction in health resource requirements being unlikely.

The Committee considered that no study was designed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments, and that the evidence was heterogenous, confounded by other factors, and subject to biases (eg missing data and publication bias). However, the Committee considered that higher quality evidence would not be expected to eventuate and considered that the available evidence supported use of fomepizole with reported efficacy at least equivalent to that of ethanol. The Committee noted that there is no evidence that fomepizole would reduce patient time in intensive care units (ICU) or reduce the need for dialysis. The Committee considered that the ease of fomepizole administration and its reduced adverse event profile compared to ethanol were the most relevant outcomes for Pharmac assessment. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to align with international guidance documents that reflect use of fomepizole as international best practice for this indication given the evidence base.</p><h2><strong><em>Suitability</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the shelf life of fomepizole is 60 months and considered that its ease of administration would enable treatment to be initiated in smaller centres, although patients would be expected to require admission to ICU even if fomepizole were used.

The Committee note that acute kidney injury occurred in 14.0% with ethanol alone and 5.1% with fomepizole, that neurological worsening occurred in 15.8% with ethanol alone and in 2.8% with fomepizole, and that one case of anaphylaxis to fomepizole was reported. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an analysis of fomepizole elimination in a series of poisoned patients and healthy humans aged \u226512 years who were enrolled in the clinical trials of the use of fomepizole for methanol (n=11) and ethylene glycol (n=15) poisoning (<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">McMartin et al. J Med Toxicol. 2022;18:19-29</a>). The Committee noted that elimination of fomepizole was assessed after individual doses, both during and without intermittent haemodialysis; after repeated doses of fomepizole in methanol- and ethylene glycol-poisoned patients, the minimum trough concentration averaged 86\u2013109 \u00b5mol/L, which was 10 times higher than the minimum therapeutic concentration.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of two systematic reviews of fomepizole compared to ethanol that did not establish superiority of fomepizole over ethanol in treatment of cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, although the reviews did not investigate these treatments for methanol poisoning (<a href=\"https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1592/phco.22.5.365.33187?sid=nlm%3Apubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Druteika et al.

The Committee considered that no study was designed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments, and that the evidence was heterogenous, confounded by other factors, and subject to biases (eg missing data and publication bias). However, the Committee considered that higher quality evidence would not be expected to eventuate and considered that the available evidence supported use of fomepizole with reported efficacy at least equivalent to that of ethanol. The Committee noted that there is no evidence that fomepizole would reduce patient time in intensive care units (ICU) or reduce the need for dialysis. The Committee considered that the ease of fomepizole administration and its reduced adverse event profile compared to ethanol were the most relevant outcomes for Pharmac assessment. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to align with international guidance documents that reflect use of fomepizole as international best practice for this indication given the evidence base.</p><h2><strong><em>Suitability</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the shelf life of fomepizole is 60 months and considered that its ease of administration would enable treatment to be initiated in smaller centres, although patients would be expected to require admission to ICU even if fomepizole were used. The Committee noted that fomepizole has treatment delivery benefits over ethanol and a potential benefit for rural patients via increasing equity of access to care.</p><h2><strong><em>Costs and Savings</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that fomepizole would be stocked in all Emergency Departments and in remote rural clinics, however, it was difficult to determine likely total stock levels, usage and wastage (ie. due to expiry of most stock before use) across the country. The Committee considered that the risk of slippage was small as fomepizole is unlikely to be used in paracetamol overdoses (most cases being mild and associated with a low incidence of consequent liver toxicity). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the significant cost of ethanol treatment for methylene glycol or ethanol poisoning, however, considered that its view had not changed regarding the potential savings with fomepizole from a reduction in health resource requirements being unlikely. The Committee also noted that other generic forms of fomepizole are available, potentially providing opportunity for different price options for this medicine.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt; color: black;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for fomepizole if it were to be funded in New Zealand for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000006fVPp&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002YFie\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
