Myopia usually results from increased axial length of the eyeball, although some cases may be due to increased curvature of the cornea, a lens with increased optical power, or occasionally due to other disease (eg arising secondary to corneal disease). The Subcommittee noted that myopia is quantitatively defined by a spherical equivalent objective refractive error of ≤ −0.50 dioptres (D) in either eye and that high myopia is defined by a spherical equivalent objective refractive error of ≤ −5.00 D in either eye (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30817826-imi-defining-and-classifying-myopia-a-proposed-set-of-standards-for-clinical-and-epidemiologic-studies/?from_term=global+prevalence+of+myopia+and+high+myopia&amp;from_filter=ds1.y_1&amp;from_pos=1"" target=""_blank"">Flitcroft et al.

The Subcommittee noted there is particularly high prevalence in East and Southeast Asian populations (60-97%) compared with the rest of the world (31-35%) and that about 20% of patients have high myopia (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26875007-global-prevalence-of-myopia-and-high-myopia-and-temporal-trends-from-2000-through-2050/"" target=""_blank"">Holden et al. Ophthalmology. 2016:123;1036-42</a>). The Subcommittee noted that myopia progresses at a faster rate at younger ages and in those with a myopic parent or myopic parents. Members noted that myopia progression after age 17 is minimal and considered that after age 21 a patient with myopia is considered to be stable with no further growth in axial length expected and no benefit to be gained from treatments intended to slow the progression of myopia. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence that reported axial lengths of ≥26 mm and refractive errors of ≤ −6 D were significantly associated with an increased lifetime risk of visual impairment (<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.4009"" target=""_blank"">Tideman et al. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2016;134:1355-63</a>). The Subcommittee noted that high myopia increases the risk of eye diseases including myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataracts. Of these, the Subcommittee noted that myopia of ≥ -7 D substantially increases the incidence of retinal detachment [odds ratio (OR) 44.2 ] and myopic maculopathy (OR 126.8), the latter of which is a permanent problem (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22772022-the-complex-interactions-of-retinal-optical-and-environmental-factors-in-myopia-aetiology/?from_term=Flitcroft+DI&amp;from_cauthor_id=30817825&amp;from_pos=10"" target=""_blank"">Flitcroft DI.

The Subcommittee considered there was substantial variation in the degree of myopia screening around the country. Members considered that a meaningful change in refraction of -0.5 D after six months from the previous assessment would be a reasonable threshold for consideration of treatment for a young patient to slow the progression of their myopia; however, the Subcommittee considered that requiring multiple visits to assess myopia progression could be challenging for some patients. Members noted that reallocation of heath resource in response to COVID-19 has meant that age 4 years eye checks are not currently performed in some regions, although members considered that this would be an appropriate time point to identify myopia in children. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are no funded pharmaceutical or other interventions for myopia. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 1,000 children in New Zealand would be receiving treatment for myopia consisting of either bifocal or Hoya MiyoSmart spectacle lenses, soft disposable multifocal contact lenses, orthokeratology or self-funded atropine eye drops. The Subcommittee noted that these interventions can be prohibitively expensive to patients due to the need for regular optometry and ophthalmology appointments and optical prescription changes. Members noted that laser eye surgery is not used for treatment of myopia in children and does not change the risk of complications such as retinal detachment, however, it may be used to correct refractive error in patients over 20 years of age.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that atropine is an anticholinergic agent which blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The Subcommittee noted that topical atropine 0.01% as a compounded eye drop is thought to interact with receptors in the eye which control growth of the eye and through this action, may slow the progression of myopia. The Subcommittee noted that atropine 0.01% eye drops are proposed to be used at a dose of one drop per eye, per day. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that two presentations of atropine 1% eye drops (Atropt and Minims Atropine Sulfate) have current Medsafe approval with no specific listed indications, however, atropine 0.01% eye drops are not approved by Medsafe for any indication. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted evidence for atropine 1.0% eye drops that came from the phase II, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomised (1:1), double-masked ATOM 1 study of 400 children with refractive error of spherical equivalent -1.00 to -6.00 D and astigmatism of -1.50 D or less (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16996612-atropine-for-the-treatment-of-childhood-myopia/?from_term=Atropine+for+the+Treatment+of+Childhood+Myopia&amp;from_pos=1"" target=""_blank"">Chua et al.

The Subcommittee considered these trials provided slightly weaker evidence of the benefit of atropine in reducing the progression of myopia in axial length. However, the Subcommittee noted that the trial populations did not represent the range of ethnicities in New Zealand and were older than the New Zealand population who would be targeted for treatment if atropine 0.01% were funded. The Subcommittee considered that while it was plausible that a benefit from atropine could be maintained beyond five years, the available evidence was not able to confirm this or inform the incidence of long-term effects (eg macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract).

However, members considered that dual therapy with atropine 0.01% eye drops and another intervention may occur eg in patients with rapidly progressing myopia. Members considered some children and their parents would not be willing to use daily eye drops, and that it would be reasonable to assume uptake of approximately 70% in patients with myopia and for whom atropine is considered a suitable treatment. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, ideally, patients would undergo axial length measurement annually to assess progression, and that the funding of atropine would be unlikely to change the ideal frequency of measurements or specialist visits. However, the Subcommittee considered that many patients would not be able to undergo regular axial length measurements as there are significant barriers to accessing specialist treatment specifically for this. The Subcommittee considered that while the funding of atropine would provide treatment to some patients from populations facing health disparities, the overall impact on health equity and the demographics of patients who would benefit from the funding of atropine are uncertain.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atropine 0.01% eye drops if it were to be funded in New Zealand for myopia.

Members considered that a meaningful change in refraction of -0.5 D after six months from the previous assessment would be a reasonable threshold for consideration of treatment for a young patient to slow the progression of their myopia; however, the Subcommittee considered that requiring multiple visits to assess myopia progression could be challenging for some patients.

The Subcommittee considered these trials provided slightly weaker evidence of the benefit of atropine in reducing the progression of myopia in axial length. However, the Subcommittee noted that the trial populations did not represent the range of ethnicities in New Zealand and were older than the New Zealand population who would be targeted for treatment if atropine 0.01% were funded. The Subcommittee considered that while it was plausible that a benefit from atropine could be maintained beyond five years, the available evidence was not able to confirm this or inform the incidence of long-term effects (eg macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract).

However, members considered that dual therapy with atropine 0.01% eye drops and another intervention may occur eg in patients with rapidly progressing myopia. Members considered some children and their parents would not be willing to use daily eye drops, and that it would be reasonable to assume uptake of approximately 70% in patients with myopia and for whom atropine is considered a suitable treatment. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, ideally, patients would undergo axial length measurement annually to assess progression, and that the funding of atropine would be unlikely to change the ideal frequency of measurements or specialist visits. However, the Subcommittee considered that many patients would not be able to undergo regular axial length measurements as there are significant barriers to accessing specialist treatment specifically for this. The Subcommittee considered that while the funding of atropine would provide treatment to some patients from populations facing health disparities, the overall impact on health equity and the demographics of patients who would benefit from the funding of atropine are uncertain.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atropine 0.01% eye drops if it were to be funded in New Zealand for myopia.

The Subcommittee considered there was substantial variation in the degree of myopia screening around the country. Members considered that a meaningful change in refraction of -0.5 D after six months from the previous assessment would be a reasonable threshold for consideration of treatment for a young patient to slow the progression of their myopia; however, the Subcommittee considered that requiring multiple visits to assess myopia progression could be challenging for some patients.

The Subcommittee noted that these interventions can be prohibitively expensive to patients due to the need for regular optometry and ophthalmology appointments and optical prescription changes.

The Subcommittee considered these trials provided slightly weaker evidence of the benefit of atropine in reducing the progression of myopia in axial length. However, the Subcommittee noted that the trial populations did not represent the range of ethnicities in New Zealand and were older than the New Zealand population who would be targeted for treatment if atropine 0.01% were funded. The Subcommittee considered that while it was plausible that a benefit from atropine could be maintained beyond five years, the available evidence was not able to confirm this or inform the incidence of long-term effects (eg macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract).

However, members considered that dual therapy with atropine 0.01% eye drops and another intervention may occur eg in patients with rapidly progressing myopia. Members considered some children and their parents would not be willing to use daily eye drops, and that it would be reasonable to assume uptake of approximately 70% in patients with myopia and for whom atropine is considered a suitable treatment. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, ideally, patients would undergo axial length measurement annually to assess progression, and that the funding of atropine would be unlikely to change the ideal frequency of measurements or specialist visits. However, the Subcommittee considered that many patients would not be able to undergo regular axial length measurements as there are significant barriers to accessing specialist treatment specifically for this. The Subcommittee considered that while the funding of atropine would provide treatment to some patients from populations facing health disparities, the overall impact on health equity and the demographics of patients who would benefit from the funding of atropine are uncertain.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atropine 0.01% eye drops if it were to be funded in New Zealand for myopia.
