Members considered that JC virus (JCV) positive people receiving ocrelizumab who need a higher efficacy treatment would likely switch to ofatumumab instead of natalizumab due to the significant risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with the latter; JCV negative people with MS would likely receive natalizumab which is considered safe and effective in that subgroup. Members considered that very few people with MS receive older injectable medicines (ie interferon beta-1 alpha, interferon beta-1-beta, and glatiramer acetate) and as those people would be receiving a long-term response to treatment, it is unlikely they would switch to a higher efficacy treatment like ofatumumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that ofatumumab should be listed only if cost-neutral to ocrelizumab (at an individual level) as the most relevant mAb comparator, and that Pharmac should use up to date infusion costs when taking this into account.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the same funding criteria was in place for all MS treatments used in RRMS and considered that there was no reason to apply different criteria to ofatumumab for RRMS.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ofatumumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for RRMS.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
