The Cardiovascular Advisory Committee considered the high health need and severe impact of HFrEF on the individual and their family/wh\u0101nau, the evidence showed that empagliflozin provides a health benefit in reducing hospitalisation, reducing all-cause mortality, and improving quality of life in those with HFrEF and the suitability benefit of empagliflozin allowing for the improved adherence with heart-failure treatments.</p><h2><em>Health need</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that HF is a complex clinical syndrome with symptoms resulting from abnormalities in cardiac function or structural abnormalities that impair the heart\u2019s ability to fill with blood at normal pressure or eject sufficient volumes of blood to fulfil the needs of the body.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that <span style=\"color: black;\">HFpEF is characterised by abnormal diastolic function, a normal LVEF and normal LV end-diastolic volume. The Committee noted that in HFpEF, the dominant functional abnormality resides in diastole, but there may also be abnormalities in systolic function, the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, right ventricle, arteries, and skeletal muscle. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee noted that HFmrEF shares features of HFpEF but is characterised by </span>some reduction in systolic function, more than seen in HFpEF, usually with progressive chamber dilation and eccentric remodelling.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that HFpEF/HFmrEF is more difficult to diagnose than HFrEF because the key objective marker of cardiac abnormality (the LVEF) is by definition preserved or mildly reduced.

At 6 weeks, empagliflozin was not associated with a significant change in 24-hour urinary sodium (mean difference, -7.85 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.43 to 6.73]; P=0.57). Empagliflozin was associated with a nonsignificant increase in fractional excretion of sodium at day 3, which was absent at week 6 (mean difference day 3, 0.30% [95% CI ,-0.03 to 0.63]; P=0.09; week 6, 0.11% [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.44]; P&gt;0.99), and a significant increase in electrolyte-free water clearance at week 6 (mean difference, 312 mL [95% CI, 26-598]; P=0.026) compared with placebo (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865004/\" target=\"_blank\">Mordi et al.

The Committee noted that these estimates assumed that uptake among the eligible population would be 30% in the first year of funding and would rise to 60% within four years.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for empagliflozin if it were to be funded in New Zealand for HFpEF and HFmrEF. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
