The Committee noted that the prevalence of MS in M\u0101ori is substantially lower than that of non-M\u0101ori. It was considered that the impact of MS, when it occurs, is likely to be greater in M\u0101ori, noting the higher representation of M\u0101ori in lower socioeconomic groups and the effect of this on functional needs and access to care and diagnostic support services.</p><h2><em>Background</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac currently funds eight disease modifying treatments for relapsing remitting MS under Special Authority.

The Committee noted that Pharmac has not previously received a funding application for SPMS, nor does it fund any treatments specifically for SPMS.</p><h2><em>Health need</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MS is an autoimmune, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is a leading cause of disability in young adults. It was noted that the majority (85-90%) of MS patients are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and that this is characterised by episodes of acute neurological deterioration (relapses), followed by partial or complete recovery (remission), and may later develop into SPMS with progressive decline. The Committee noted that SPMS is marked by fewer or no periods of remission and gradual neurological worsening with brain atrophy. It was noted that the remaining 10-15% of patients with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, which is characterised by continuous neurological worsening from the first onset of symptoms, without remission or relapse.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the diagnosis of MS internationally, including SPMS, utilises specific diagnostic criteria known as the McDonald criteria, which include cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, central nervous system (CNS) lesions separated in space and time, and continued disease progression \u2013 specifically, clinical evidence that the disease has progressed for at least one year from symptom onset. The Committee noted that under the McDonald criteria (last revised in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30470-2/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Thompson et al. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17(2):162-73.</a>]), progressive disease (both primary and secondary) has a course characterised by steadily increasing objectively documented neurological disability independent of relapses (where fluctuations, periods of stability, and superimposed relapses may occur). The Committee noted that the change from RRMS to SPMS is a gradual process rather than an abrupt transition, with diagnoses often made retrospectively. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the age and sex-standardised prevalence rate of MS in New Zealand is 73.1 per 100,000 (standardised to the European population) and the annual age standardised incidence is 3.3 per 100,000. The Committee noted that a latitudinal gradient exists with MS prevalence increasing threefold from the North (37 deg. S) to the South (48 deg. S) of NZ (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586813005912?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alla et al. J Clin Neurosci. 2014;21:1288-91</a>). The Committee noted that the overall age and sex standardised prevalence of MS in M\u0101ori has been reported to be between 20.6 and 24.2 per 100,000 (approximately 3.6 times lower that of non-M\u0101ori). The Committee noted that earlier regional surveys (1968-2001) all reported much lower, or zero, prevalence for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori. The Committee considered that M\u0101ori ethnicity does not seem to be related to the latitudinal patterns of MS prevalence observed in New Zealand. The Committee noted that whilst it is well recognised that under-reporting is a factor in low disease prevalence in indigenous populations, differences in genetic factors and differing susceptibility to environmental factors are also likely to play a role (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586813005912?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alla et al.

The Committee noted that, based on today\u2019s total NZ MS population being over 4000, MSNZ has calculated over 1250 people to have SPMS, with 632 of these individuals having an EDSS of 3.0-6.5 at any one time (MSNZ supplementary information).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with SPMS experience wide-ranging symptoms and a high symptomatic burden throughout their disease course, including cognitive and memory impairment, loss of mobility, fatigue, pain, depression, bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction, speech and auditory impairment, and oedema. It was noted that studies have demonstrated that patients with SPMS experience greater symptom severity than those with RRMS (Pike et al. 2015, <a href=\"https://www.dovepress.com/characteristics-burden-of-illness-and-physical-functioning-of-patients-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT\" target=\"_blank\">Gross et al. Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. 2017;13:1349-57</a>). The Committee noted that the health-related quality of life of those with SPMS is reported to decline at a faster rate compared to those with RRMS, as people progress through EDSS states more quickly. It was also noted that the health-related quality of life may be worse in the same EDSS state for someone with SPMS compared to someone with RRMS (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00019053-200826100-00005\" target=\"_blank\">McCrone et al.

The Committee noted that those with SPMS experience numerous debilitating physical and mental symptoms, substantial comorbidities, and significant disability which frequently requires support often needing to be provided by family and friends.

It was noted that the majority (85-90%) of MS patients are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and that this is characterised by episodes of acute neurological deterioration (relapses), followed by partial or complete recovery (remission), and may later develop into SPMS with progressive decline. The Committee noted that SPMS is marked by fewer or no periods of remission and gradual neurological worsening with brain atrophy. It was noted that the remaining 10-15% of patients with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, which is characterised by continuous neurological worsening from the first onset of symptoms, without remission or relapse.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the diagnosis of MS internationally, including SPMS, utilises specific diagnostic criteria known as the McDonald criteria, which include cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, central nervous system (CNS) lesions separated in space and time, and continued disease progression \u2013 specifically, clinical evidence that the disease has progressed for at least one year from symptom onset. The Committee noted that under the McDonald criteria (last revised in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30470-2/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Thompson et al.

The Committee noted that earlier regional surveys (1968-2001) all reported much lower, or zero, prevalence for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori. The Committee considered that M\u0101ori ethnicity does not seem to be related to the latitudinal patterns of MS prevalence observed in New Zealand. The Committee noted that whilst it is well recognised that under-reporting is a factor in low disease prevalence in indigenous populations, differences in genetic factors and differing susceptibility to environmental factors are also likely to play a role (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586813005912?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alla et al.

The Committee noted that SPMS is associated with a high level of physical and mental impairment, and it would therefore be expected that many patients with SPMS would require caregivers, which is often provided by the person\u2019s family. It was also considered that those living rurally may be disproportionately impacted by SPMS due to reduced access to secondary care and specialised support services.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently no funded disease modifying treatments specifically for SPMS, but that people with RRMS who meet the funding criteria can continue to receive <a href=\"https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/ScheduleOnline.php?code=A222601\" target=\"_blank\">funded treatment</a> until they surpass an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.5. It was noted that people with SPMS are currently managed in primary care, predominantly due to the lack of funded disease modifying treatments neurologists could prescribe for the management of SPMS.

The Committee noted that the primary outcome was time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), which was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS if the baseline score was 3.0 to 5.0, or a 0.5-point increase if the baseline score was 5.5 to 6.5, confirmed at a scheduled visit at least 3 months later (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618304756?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Kappos et al.

The Committee considered that the EXPAND trial demonstrated that three months of siponimod treatment reduced the risk of CDP, worsening in cognitive processing speed, relapses, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and inflammation versus placebo in SPMS. The Committee considered that the benefit of siponimod was demonstrated in the EDSS range of 3.0 to 6.5. The Committee considered that siponimod had no significant effect on the main secondary endpoint (T25FW), an appropriate and well-established measure of gait velocity with a high association with the EDSS; however, T25FW does not include the person\u2019s ability to vary gait to perform different tasks needed during walking. The Committee considered that the side effect profile of siponimod appears similar to that of other MS treatments and are relatively easy to monitor, however also noted that siponimod may increase the risk of contracting infections such as COVID-19 (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211-0348(21)00701-X\" target=\"_blank\">Skori\u0107 et al.

The Committee noted comments made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on the primary outcome of the EXPAND trial, which assessed disability progression confirmed after three months and not after six months as recommended by the European Medicines Agency; rather, 6-month CDP was a secondary outcome. The Committee also considered there to be a paucity of evidence regarding the long-term effects of lymphocyte depletion, however members considered information could be extrapolated from other immune modulators and immunosuppression and transplant patients to approximate this.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the comments made by other Health Technology Assessment agencies in the evaluation of siponimod. It was also noted that NICE highlighted that CDP was based on the EDSS score and it is recognised that this does not adequately assess upper limb function and cognitive impairment. The Committee noted NICE\u2019s comments on the post hoc subgroup analysis of patients, which stated that since the study was neither planned nor powered for this post hoc analysis, these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that siponimod is administered orally once daily at approximately the same time each day. The Committee noted that the tablets should be swallowed whole with water, which may be challenging for patients who have difficulty with swallowing medicines. The Committee noted that, as siponimod can be self-administered by the patient or caregiver in the community, the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility would be minimised. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the individual\u2019s CYP2C9 genotype must be determined before initiation of treatment with siponimod. The Committee considered that this genotype testing is not currently available in New Zealand, and currently if CYP2C9 tests are required they are sent to Australia to be processed. The Committee considered that approximately 5.5% of the New Zealand Europeans and 0.4% of M\u0101ori are estimated to have the CYP2C9*3*3 genotype in which siponimod treatment is contraindicated. </p><h2><em>Cost and savings</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that disease management costs for MS have long been noted to increase with disease progression to higher EDSS scores. The Committee noted that if siponimod delays the rate of disease progression, then the impact on the health system may also be delayed as patients would spend relatively more time in better health. The Committee also noted the Economic Burden Report provided by MSNZ.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if siponimod were to be funded, more people would require an MRI scan to confirm a SPMS diagnosis to determine whether they are eligible, which may have a substantial resource impact for Te Whatu Ora - Health NZ hospitals. The Committee considered that having an available treatment for SPMS may increase the diagnoses of SPMS. The Committee noted that an available treatment for SPMS would mean that individuals would remain under the care of a neurologist.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that genotype testing would create an additional cost, with CYP2C9 tests estimated to cost approximately $2000 AUD per test. The Committee noted and agreed with the supplier\u2019s assumption that 12% of patients would require a lower 1 mg dose (and therefore require the 0.25 mg formulation) based on them being classed as \u2018intermediate metabolisers\u2019 according to their CYP2C9 genotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered the cost-effectiveness assumptions to be broadly reasonable.

The Committee noted that the evidence suggests that siponimod would be most effective in people with active SPMS with an EDSS of 3.0 to 6.5; members considered that an important outcome of siponimod treatment was quality of life. The Committee <strong>recommended</strong> that specialist advice be sought from the Neurological Advisory Committee regarding appropriate Special Authority criteria for siponimod, in particular, the renewal criteria and the appropriateness of measures such as EDSS or quality of life. </p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for siponimod if it were to be funded in New Zealand for SPMS.

The Committee noted that the prevalence of MS in M\u0101ori is substantially lower than that of non-M\u0101ori. It was considered that the impact of MS, when it occurs, is likely to be greater in M\u0101ori, noting the higher representation of M\u0101ori in lower socioeconomic groups and the effect of this on functional needs and access to care and diagnostic support services.</p><h2><em>Background</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac currently funds eight disease modifying treatments for relapsing remitting MS under Special Authority.

It was noted that the majority (85-90%) of MS patients are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and that this is characterised by episodes of acute neurological deterioration (relapses), followed by partial or complete recovery (remission), and may later develop into SPMS with progressive decline. The Committee noted that SPMS is marked by fewer or no periods of remission and gradual neurological worsening with brain atrophy. It was noted that the remaining 10-15% of patients with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, which is characterised by continuous neurological worsening from the first onset of symptoms, without remission or relapse.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the diagnosis of MS internationally, including SPMS, utilises specific diagnostic criteria known as the McDonald criteria, which include cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, central nervous system (CNS) lesions separated in space and time, and continued disease progression \u2013 specifically, clinical evidence that the disease has progressed for at least one year from symptom onset. The Committee noted that under the McDonald criteria (last revised in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30470-2/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Thompson et al. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17(2):162-73.</a>]), progressive disease (both primary and secondary) has a course characterised by steadily increasing objectively documented neurological disability independent of relapses (where fluctuations, periods of stability, and superimposed relapses may occur). The Committee noted that the change from RRMS to SPMS is a gradual process rather than an abrupt transition, with diagnoses often made retrospectively. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the age and sex-standardised prevalence rate of MS in New Zealand is 73.1 per 100,000 (standardised to the European population) and the annual age standardised incidence is 3.3 per 100,000. The Committee noted that a latitudinal gradient exists with MS prevalence increasing threefold from the North (37 deg. S) to the South (48 deg. S) of NZ (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586813005912?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alla et al. J Clin Neurosci. 2014;21:1288-91</a>). The Committee noted that the overall age and sex standardised prevalence of MS in M\u0101ori has been reported to be between 20.6 and 24.2 per 100,000 (approximately 3.6 times lower that of non-M\u0101ori). The Committee noted that earlier regional surveys (1968-2001) all reported much lower, or zero, prevalence for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori. The Committee considered that M\u0101ori ethnicity does not seem to be related to the latitudinal patterns of MS prevalence observed in New Zealand. The Committee noted that whilst it is well recognised that under-reporting is a factor in low disease prevalence in indigenous populations, differences in genetic factors and differing susceptibility to environmental factors are also likely to play a role (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586813005912?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alla et al.

The Committee noted that, based on today\u2019s total NZ MS population being over 4000, MSNZ has calculated over 1250 people to have SPMS, with 632 of these individuals having an EDSS of 3.0-6.5 at any one time (MSNZ supplementary information).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with SPMS experience wide-ranging symptoms and a high symptomatic burden throughout their disease course, including cognitive and memory impairment, loss of mobility, fatigue, pain, depression, bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction, speech and auditory impairment, and oedema. It was noted that studies have demonstrated that patients with SPMS experience greater symptom severity than those with RRMS (Pike et al. 2015, <a href=\"https://www.dovepress.com/characteristics-burden-of-illness-and-physical-functioning-of-patients-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT\" target=\"_blank\">Gross et al. Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. 2017;13:1349-57</a>). The Committee noted that the health-related quality of life of those with SPMS is reported to decline at a faster rate compared to those with RRMS, as people progress through EDSS states more quickly. It was also noted that the health-related quality of life may be worse in the same EDSS state for someone with SPMS compared to someone with RRMS (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00019053-200826100-00005\" target=\"_blank\">McCrone et al.

The Committee noted that those with SPMS experience numerous debilitating physical and mental symptoms, substantial comorbidities, and significant disability which frequently requires support often needing to be provided by family and friends. The Committee considered that this further highlighted the severe unmet need for those with SPMS.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that caregivers of patients with MS have been reported to experience high levels of distress and reduced health related quality of life (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117557/\" target=\"_blank\">Figved et al, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2007; 78:1097-1102</a>). Similarly, the Committee noted that the health related quality of life of children who have a parent with MS has also been reported to be impacted by the disease (<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1352458505ms1183oa?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">Yahav et al, Mult Scler 2005; 11:464-8</a>). The Committee noted that SPMS is associated with a high level of physical and mental impairment, and it would therefore be expected that many patients with SPMS would require caregivers, which is often provided by the person\u2019s family. It was also considered that those living rurally may be disproportionately impacted by SPMS due to reduced access to secondary care and specialised support services.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently no funded disease modifying treatments specifically for SPMS, but that people with RRMS who meet the funding criteria can continue to receive <a href=\"https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/ScheduleOnline.php?code=A222601\" target=\"_blank\">funded treatment</a> until they surpass an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.5. It was noted that people with SPMS are currently managed in primary care, predominantly due to the lack of funded disease modifying treatments neurologists could prescribe for the management of SPMS. The Committee considered that the funding of a treatment, such as siponimod, would result in people being under the care of a neurologist once again. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that this proposal aligns with the Government health priority of long-term conditions.</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that siponimod is a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that acts as a functional antagonist on S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, thereby preventing egress from lymph nodes and reducing the recirculation of T cells into the CNS to limit central inflammation (<a href=\"https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/11019/smpc#PHARMACOKINETIC_PROPS\" target=\"_blank\">Mayzent SPC.

The Committee noted that the primary outcome was time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), which was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS if the baseline score was 3.0 to 5.0, or a 0.5-point increase if the baseline score was 5.5 to 6.5, confirmed at a scheduled visit at least 3 months later (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618304756?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Kappos et al.

The Committee considered that the benefit of siponimod was demonstrated in the EDSS range of 3.0 to 6.5. The Committee considered that siponimod had no significant effect on the main secondary endpoint (T25FW), an appropriate and well-established measure of gait velocity with a high association with the EDSS; however, T25FW does not include the person\u2019s ability to vary gait to perform different tasks needed during walking.

The Committee considered that approximately 5.5% of the New Zealand Europeans and 0.4% of M\u0101ori are estimated to have the CYP2C9*3*3 genotype in which siponimod treatment is contraindicated. </p><h2><em>Cost and savings</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that disease management costs for MS have long been noted to increase with disease progression to higher EDSS scores. The Committee noted that if siponimod delays the rate of disease progression, then the impact on the health system may also be delayed as patients would spend relatively more time in better health. The Committee also noted the Economic Burden Report provided by MSNZ.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if siponimod were to be funded, more people would require an MRI scan to confirm a SPMS diagnosis to determine whether they are eligible, which may have a substantial resource impact for Te Whatu Ora - Health NZ hospitals. The Committee considered that having an available treatment for SPMS may increase the diagnoses of SPMS. The Committee noted that an available treatment for SPMS would mean that individuals would remain under the care of a neurologist.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that genotype testing would create an additional cost, with CYP2C9 tests estimated to cost approximately $2000 AUD per test. The Committee noted and agreed with the supplier\u2019s assumption that 12% of patients would require a lower 1 mg dose (and therefore require the 0.25 mg formulation) based on them being classed as \u2018intermediate metabolisers\u2019 according to their CYP2C9 genotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered the cost-effectiveness assumptions to be broadly reasonable. Members specifically noted that the assumption used in previous Pharmac PPMS modelling that patients could not move to a less severe EDSS state would be appropriate in the modelling of SPMS as well.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that MS phenotypes are not always distinct or clear, and therefore that funding criteria should be carefully considered to ensure those who would most benefit are not excluded. The Committee noted that the evidence suggests that siponimod would be most effective in people with active SPMS with an EDSS of 3.0 to 6.5; members considered that an important outcome of siponimod treatment was quality of life. The Committee <strong>recommended</strong> that specialist advice be sought from the Neurological Advisory Committee regarding appropriate Special Authority criteria for siponimod, in particular, the renewal criteria and the appropriateness of measures such as EDSS or quality of life. </p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for siponimod if it were to be funded in New Zealand for SPMS. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ0000045WrQ&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002YFWY\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
