          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that opioid use disorder is a chronic, relapsing and remitting condition that is characterised by the compulsive self-administration of opioid substances for non-medical uses or their administration in excessive doses (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19712126/\" target=\"_blank\">Sellman. Addiction. 2010;105:6-13</a>). The Subcommittee noted that it is associated with significantly increased rates of morbidity and mortality.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that according to the 2016 New Zealand Drug Harm report (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/research-report-new-zealand-drug-harm-index-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2016</a>), approximately 2000 people in New Zealand have opioid use disorder, however members considered that this is likely an underestimate as over 5000 individuals receive opioid substitution treatment each year. The Subcommittee noted there are approximately 10 direct deaths from opioid drug use each year in New Zealand, the majority of which are avoidable (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23961881/\" target=\"_blank\">Degenhardt et al. Addiction. 2014,10990-9</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered people with opioid use disorder have a high health need, noting the high morbidity and mortality rate (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19563562/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Addiction. 2009;104:1193-200</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21054613/\" target=\"_blank\">Degenhardt et al. Addiction. 2011;106:32-51</a>), increased infection rates compared with the general population, and social implications of opioid use disorder.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the health need of family and wh\u0101nau of people with opioid use disorder can be significant and become more serious over time. 9 The Subcommittee also considered that opioid use disorder results in a large cost to society, with opioid use disorder carrying an increased likelihood of criminal justice system involvement and negative outcomes on, employment, health, residential stability, education and child welfare (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33787832/\" target=\"_blank\">Fairley et al. JAMA Psych. 2021;78:767-77</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the 2006 NZ Mental Health Survey data, which reported that substance use disorder as higher for M\u0101ori at 6.0% compared with Pacific people, 3.2% and others, 3.0% (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/mental-health-survey-summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2006</a>). Members considered that individuals with low socioeconomic status, prisoners, remote populations and individuals with mental illness are also disproportionally affected by opioid use disorder.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone and methadone are currently funded and used in the treatment of opioid use disorder, in conjunction with medical, social and psychological support. The Subcommittee considered that there are currently issues with access to and availability of treatments for opioid use disorder. Members considered that healthcare professional staffing resource (including specialists), access to pharmacies, stigma, discrimination and social inequity all impact the accessibility of treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is a \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor partial agonist, and \u03ba (kappa) opioid receptor antagonist, with its activity in opioid maintenance treatment attributed to its slow dissociation from the \u00b5 receptors in the brain which reduces craving for opioids and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee noted that this creates a \u201cceiling\u201d effect that limits the risk of overdose while reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee considered that the mechanism of action meant that buprenorphine depot reduces the risk of accidental opioid overdose, is safer than and avoids some of the side effects associated with methadone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is classified as a Class C4 controlled drug and both Sublocade and Buvidal require medical, social and psychological support as per their Medsafe approval.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were two funding applications under consideration \u2013 Buvidal and Sublocade, both buprenorphine depot formulations.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Buvidal </i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal can be administered weekly or monthly and administered into the subcutaneous tissue of the buttock, thigh, abdomen, or upper arm. The Subcommittee noted that the recommended starting dose of Buvidal is 16 mg weekly, with one or two additional 8 mg doses at least one day apart, to a target dose of 24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week, with a recommended dose for the second treatment week being the total dose administered during the week of initiation. The Subcommittee noted that the monthly formulation then may be started and that clients can switch between the weekly and monthly formulations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal is non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone. The Subcommittee noted the randomised, double-blind, doubledummy, active-controlled trial which investigated sublingual placebo plus weekly / monthly buprenorphine depot, compared with sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone plus weekly/monthly placebo injections in individuals with opioid use 10 disorder for 24 weeks (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799968/\" target=\"_blank\">Lofwall et al. JAMA int med. 2018;178(6):764\u2010773</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the group treated with buprenorphine depot demonstrated a statistically significant greater response rate compared with the sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone group (3.0% difference (95% CI: \u22124.0% to 9.9%; P&lt;0.001); while those treated with buprenorphine depot also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in opioid-negative urine samples (6.7% difference, 95% CI: ,\u22120.1% to 13.6%; P&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the non-inferiority evidence for Buvidal was strong and demonstrated that buprenorphine depot was comparable to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970256/\" target=\"_blank\">Lintzeris et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2021.4(5):e219041 </a></p><p>\u2022 Frost et al. Addiction. 2019;114(8):1416-1426</p><p><br></p><p><i>Sublocade </i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the recommended dose of Sublocade is 300 mg monthly for the first two months, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg monthly or 300 mg monthly for patients who tolerate the 100 mg dose, but do not demonstrate a satisfactory clinical response. The Subcommittee noted that Sublocade is administered via abdominal subcutaneous injection.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated buprenorphine depot compared with placebo in individuals with moderate of severe opioid use disorder for six months (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792007/\" target=\"_blank\">Haight et al. Lancet. 2019;393:778-90</a>). The Subcommittee noted the primary outcome of opioid abstinence was significantly greater in those treated with buprenorphine depot compared with placebo. The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile was consistent with other buprenorphine products. The Subcommittee considered that there did not appear to be an additional benefit from the 300 mg dose in comparison to the 100 mg dose.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188268/\" target=\"_blank\">Andorn et al. J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2020;40:231-9 </a></p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952623/\" target=\"_blank\">Ling et al.

Addiction. 2010;105:6-13</a>). The Subcommittee noted that it is associated with significantly increased rates of morbidity and mortality.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that according to the 2016 New Zealand Drug Harm report (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/research-report-new-zealand-drug-harm-index-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2016</a>), approximately 2000 people in New Zealand have opioid use disorder, however members considered that this is likely an underestimate as over 5000 individuals receive opioid substitution treatment each year. The Subcommittee noted there are approximately 10 direct deaths from opioid drug use each year in New Zealand, the majority of which are avoidable (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23961881/\" target=\"_blank\">Degenhardt et al. Addiction. 2014,10990-9</a>).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered people with opioid use disorder have a high health need, noting the high morbidity and mortality rate (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19563562/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Addiction. 2009;104:1193-200</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21054613/\" target=\"_blank\">Degenhardt et al. Addiction. 2011;106:32-51</a>), increased infection rates compared with the general population, and social implications of opioid use disorder.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the health need of family and wh\u0101nau of people with opioid use disorder can be significant and become more serious over time. 9 The Subcommittee also considered that opioid use disorder results in a large cost to society, with opioid use disorder carrying an increased likelihood of criminal justice system involvement and negative outcomes on, employment, health, residential stability, education and child welfare (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33787832/\" target=\"_blank\">Fairley et al. JAMA Psych. 2021;78:767-77</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the 2006 NZ Mental Health Survey data, which reported that substance use disorder as higher for M\u0101ori at 6.0% compared with Pacific people, 3.2% and others, 3.0% (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/mental-health-survey-summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2006</a>). Members considered that individuals with low socioeconomic status, prisoners, remote populations and individuals with mental illness are also disproportionally affected by opioid use disorder.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone and methadone are currently funded and used in the treatment of opioid use disorder, in conjunction with medical, social and psychological support. The Subcommittee considered that there are currently issues with access to and availability of treatments for opioid use disorder. Members considered that healthcare professional staffing resource (including specialists), access to pharmacies, stigma, discrimination and social inequity all impact the accessibility of treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is a \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor partial agonist, and \u03ba (kappa) opioid receptor antagonist, with its activity in opioid maintenance treatment attributed to its slow dissociation from the \u00b5 receptors in the brain which reduces craving for opioids and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee noted that this creates a \u201cceiling\u201d effect that limits the risk of overdose while reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee considered that the mechanism of action meant that buprenorphine depot reduces the risk of accidental opioid overdose, is safer than and avoids some of the side effects associated with methadone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is classified as a Class C4 controlled drug and both Sublocade and Buvidal require medical, social and psychological support as per their Medsafe approval.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were two funding applications under consideration \u2013 Buvidal and Sublocade, both buprenorphine depot formulations.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Buvidal </i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal can be administered weekly or monthly and administered into the subcutaneous tissue of the buttock, thigh, abdomen, or upper arm. The Subcommittee noted that the recommended starting dose of Buvidal is 16 mg weekly, with one or two additional 8 mg doses at least one day apart, to a target dose of 24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week, with a recommended dose for the second treatment week being the total dose administered during the week of initiation. The Subcommittee noted that the monthly formulation then may be started and that clients can switch between the weekly and monthly formulations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal is non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone. The Subcommittee noted the randomised, double-blind, doubledummy, active-controlled trial which investigated sublingual placebo plus weekly / monthly buprenorphine depot, compared with sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone plus weekly/monthly placebo injections in individuals with opioid use 10 disorder for 24 weeks (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799968/\" target=\"_blank\">Lofwall et al. JAMA int med. 2018;178(6):764\u2010773</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the group treated with buprenorphine depot demonstrated a statistically significant greater response rate compared with the sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone group (3.0% difference (95% CI: \u22124.0% to 9.9%; P&lt;0.001); while those treated with buprenorphine depot also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in opioid-negative urine samples (6.7% difference, 95% CI: ,\u22120.1% to 13.6%; P&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the non-inferiority evidence for Buvidal was strong and demonstrated that buprenorphine depot was comparable to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970256/\" target=\"_blank\">Lintzeris et al.

The Subcommittee noted that Sublocade is administered via abdominal subcutaneous injection.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated buprenorphine depot compared with placebo in individuals with moderate of severe opioid use disorder for six months (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792007/\" target=\"_blank\">Haight et al. Lancet. 2019;393:778-90</a>). The Subcommittee noted the primary outcome of opioid abstinence was significantly greater in those treated with buprenorphine depot compared with placebo. The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile was consistent with other buprenorphine products.

Addiction. 2011;106:32-51</a>), increased infection rates compared with the general population, and social implications of opioid use disorder.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the health need of family and wh\u0101nau of people with opioid use disorder can be significant and become more serious over time. 9 The Subcommittee also considered that opioid use disorder results in a large cost to society, with opioid use disorder carrying an increased likelihood of criminal justice system involvement and negative outcomes on, employment, health, residential stability, education and child welfare (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33787832/\" target=\"_blank\">Fairley et al. JAMA Psych. 2021;78:767-77</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the 2006 NZ Mental Health Survey data, which reported that substance use disorder as higher for M\u0101ori at 6.0% compared with Pacific people, 3.2% and others, 3.0% (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/mental-health-survey-summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2006</a>). Members considered that individuals with low socioeconomic status, prisoners, remote populations and individuals with mental illness are also disproportionally affected by opioid use disorder.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone and methadone are currently funded and used in the treatment of opioid use disorder, in conjunction with medical, social and psychological support. The Subcommittee considered that there are currently issues with access to and availability of treatments for opioid use disorder. Members considered that healthcare professional staffing resource (including specialists), access to pharmacies, stigma, discrimination and social inequity all impact the accessibility of treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is a \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor partial agonist, and \u03ba (kappa) opioid receptor antagonist, with its activity in opioid maintenance treatment attributed to its slow dissociation from the \u00b5 receptors in the brain which reduces craving for opioids and opioid withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee noted that this creates a \u201cceiling\u201d effect that limits the risk of overdose while reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The Subcommittee considered that the mechanism of action meant that buprenorphine depot reduces the risk of accidental opioid overdose, is safer than and avoids some of the side effects associated with methadone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine is classified as a Class C4 controlled drug and both Sublocade and Buvidal require medical, social and psychological support as per their Medsafe approval.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were two funding applications under consideration \u2013 Buvidal and Sublocade, both buprenorphine depot formulations.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Buvidal </i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal can be administered weekly or monthly and administered into the subcutaneous tissue of the buttock, thigh, abdomen, or upper arm. The Subcommittee noted that the recommended starting dose of Buvidal is 16 mg weekly, with one or two additional 8 mg doses at least one day apart, to a target dose of 24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week, with a recommended dose for the second treatment week being the total dose administered during the week of initiation. The Subcommittee noted that the monthly formulation then may be started and that clients can switch between the weekly and monthly formulations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Buvidal is non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone. The Subcommittee noted the randomised, double-blind, doubledummy, active-controlled trial which investigated sublingual placebo plus weekly / monthly buprenorphine depot, compared with sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone plus weekly/monthly placebo injections in individuals with opioid use 10 disorder for 24 weeks (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799968/\" target=\"_blank\">Lofwall et al. JAMA int med. 2018;178(6):764\u2010773</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the group treated with buprenorphine depot demonstrated a statistically significant greater response rate compared with the sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone group (3.0% difference (95% CI: \u22124.0% to 9.9%; P&lt;0.001); while those treated with buprenorphine depot also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in opioid-negative urine samples (6.7% difference, 95% CI: ,\u22120.1% to 13.6%; P&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the non-inferiority evidence for Buvidal was strong and demonstrated that buprenorphine depot was comparable to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970256/\" target=\"_blank\">Lintzeris et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2021.4(5):e219041 </a></p><p>\u2022 Frost et al. Addiction. 2019;114(8):1416-1426</p><p><br></p><p><i>Sublocade </i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the recommended dose of Sublocade is 300 mg monthly for the first two months, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg monthly or 300 mg monthly for patients who tolerate the 100 mg dose, but do not demonstrate a satisfactory clinical response. The Subcommittee noted that Sublocade is administered via abdominal subcutaneous injection.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated buprenorphine depot compared with placebo in individuals with moderate of severe opioid use disorder for six months (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792007/\" target=\"_blank\">Haight et al. Lancet. 2019;393:778-90</a>). The Subcommittee noted the primary outcome of opioid abstinence was significantly greater in those treated with buprenorphine depot compared with placebo. The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile was consistent with other buprenorphine products. The Subcommittee considered that there did not appear to be an additional benefit from the 300 mg dose in comparison to the 100 mg dose.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188268/\" target=\"_blank\">Andorn et al. J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2020;40:231-9 </a></p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952623/\" target=\"_blank\">Ling et al. J Subst Abuse Treat. 2020;110:1-8</a></p><p><br></p><p><i>General</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence of benefit of buprenorphine depot for opioid use disorder was of good strength, with good benefit shown, both compared with placebo and as non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence was highly relevant to the New Zealand setting.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence suggested that buprenorphine depot would maintain clients on treatment, which over time would result in additional benefits to those observed in the trials. The Subcommittee considered 11 that these data would be best demonstrated in population-based cohort studies with long follow up.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there was not currently any health-related quality of life evidence for buprenorphine depot, however considered it reasonable to assume that treatment with buprenorphine depot would result in improved health-related quality of life.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also considered that buprenorphine depot would provide benefits to individuals and their wh\u0101nau from minimised diversion, less pharmacy visits, steady-state effect and a more favourable safety profile than methadone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that buprenorphine depot would likely improve adherence compared with sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone, but would require appropriate patients to be initiated on depot treatment.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine with naloxone sublingual tablets and methadone are commonly dispensed daily in community pharmacies, and the availability of an alternative treatment would likely reduce these pharmacy visits. The Subcommittee noted that buprenorphine depot would require administration by a healthcare professional once per week or month (depending on brand). The Subcommittee noted that this difference would mean that adaptations in the mechanisms by which treatment is delivered may be necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered it was unclear where buprenorphine depot would be administered to patients, with options including Community Alcohol and Drug Services, community pharmacies and general practice. The Subcommittee considered that if a client were to receive their depot in general practice, the cost of the injection would fall to clients, and as such members considered that the majority of clients (at least initially) would receive their treatment at Community Alcohol and Drug Services. The Subcommittee considered that this would add to those services\u2019 already overloaded workloads. The Subcommittee considered that the cost of administration should be included in the cost analysis for the healthcare system.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the availability of buprenorphine depot would be unlikely to reduce the number of visits a client has with health care services (with the exception of pharmacy for daily pickup). Members considered that the availability of buprenorphine depot may increase referrals to Community Alcohol and Drug services.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that buprenorphine depot had a large suitability benefit compared with currently funded oral buprenorphine with naloxone and methadone, for both the individual and their wh\u0101nau, particularly in regard to the less regular administration. The Subcommittee considered that buprenorphine depot was highly likely to provide substantial benefit in rural communities and for individuals having difficulty remaining in employment, where daily access to a pharmacy can provide a significant barrier to current treatment access.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the different dosing schedules of Sublocade and Buvidal were unlikely to cause any additional advantages or disadvantages. The Subcommittee noted that the requirement of cold chain storage of Sublocade may result in additional health sector costs.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that those who would benefit most from buprenorphine depot are individuals with opioid use disorder, with a preference for 12 weekly or monthly injection, or those who frequently relapse with a history of nonadherence to oral treatment, and those with a history of overdose on methadone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the majority of new clients with opioid use disorder now initiate on buprenorphine with naloxone rather than methadone, however that the majority of individuals on methadone would be unlikely to switch treatment if buprenorphine depot were made available. Members considered that patient numbers were difficult to estimate, but considered that a significant minority of those taking sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone would switch to buprenorphine depot plus approximately 10% of methadone users, with total patient numbers likely to be over 1,000. Members considered that the uptake trend of antipsychotic depots could be used to model uptake of buprenorphine depot.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for Buvidal if it were to be funded in New Zealand for opioid use disorder. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000006fVQP&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001jQid\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
