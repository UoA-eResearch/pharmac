These formulae were developed from predominantly European populations and that the CKD-EPI equation included a race coefficient of 1.212, and that this multiplier was applied to individuals identified as African American. The Committee noted that this coefficient was based on false notions of African Americans having higher lean mass than people of other ethnicities.

The Committee considered that this systemic bias in the way eGFR was calculated has resulted in historic harm to these groups, noting that many could have been denied appropriate care because their renal function was being overstated by the MDRD.\xa0</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) which is found in the proximal tubules in the kidneys.

In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RR were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0·77, 95% CI 0·70–0·84) and the risk of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation or heart failure by 23% (0·77, 95% CI 0·74–0·81), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0·86, 95% CI 0·81–0·92) but did not significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (0·94, 95% CI 0·88–1·02). For these mortality outcomes, RR were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of what the individuals eGFR was prior to starting the trial.

The Committee considered this would especially be the case for understanding the benefits associated with empagliflozin among individuals with earlier stage CKD, who were likely to be on treatment for longer and could potentially experience the greatest delays in time to requiring either additional care for CKD complications or renal replacement therapies.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would provide a health benefit to family, whānau and wider society, by slowing the progression of CKD and in turn delaying the need for individuals to receive renal replacement therapy or treatment for CKD-related complications.

Individuals without diabetes requiring chronic dialysis was experienced at a rate of 1.5 events per 100 patient-years for individuals receiving dapagliflozin and 2.1 events per 100-patient years for individuals receiving placebo (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.36-1.09]).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review and meta-analysis in which 90,409 individuals with CKD including 15,605 (17.3%) without diabetes received an SGLT inhibitor. The study reported that the risk of kidney disease progression was reduced for those treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo by 37% (relative risk [RR] 0·63, 95% CI 0·58–0·69) with similar RR in patients with and without diabetes. In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RR were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0·77, 95% CI 0·70–0·84) and the risk of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation or heart failure by 23% (0·77, 95% CI 0·74–0·81), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0·86, 95% CI 0·81–0·92) but did not significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (0·94, 95% CI 0·88–1·02). For these mortality outcomes, RR were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of what the individuals eGFR was prior to starting the trial.

The Committee considered that dapagliflozin may be slightly more efficacious than empagliflozin and canagliflozin, based on the available evidence. The Committee considered however that differences in reported efficacy between SGLT2 inhibitor trials could have been driven by differences in baseline characteristics of trial participants.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the evidence to support use of empagliflozin in CKD to be of high quality and moderate strength.

The Committee considered that such a short length of follow-up in the trial meant that the longer-term trajectory of these outcomes would need to be extrapolated from limited clinical data, introducing uncertainty in the Committee’s assessment of the ultimate likely treatment benefit associated with empagliflozin. The Committee considered this would especially be the case for understanding the benefits associated with empagliflozin among individuals with earlier stage CKD, who were likely to be on treatment for longer and could potentially experience the greatest delays in time to requiring either additional care for CKD complications or renal replacement therapies.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would provide a health benefit to family, whānau and wider society, by slowing the progression of CKD and in turn delaying the need for individuals to receive renal replacement therapy or treatment for CKD-related complications. The Committee considered that this may improve the health-related quality of life of family and whānau, by reducing the burden of care associated with dialysis or hospital admissions.</p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that empagliflozin is an oral medication that is administered once daily, in addition to other community funded medications.

The Committee considered that rates of eGFR and uACR testing in primary care would increase if access to empagliflozin were to be widened, as primary care clinicians would be encouraged to screen high-risk individuals for CKD to see if they are eligible for empagliflozin. The Committee considered that a whole-of-system approach was needed to support screening for CKD in primary care and equitable uptake of empagliflozin, particularly for Māori, Pacific peoples and other groups disproportionately impacted by CKD. The Committee considered there is a risk that, despite strong initial uptake, persistence might wane due to the asymptomatic nature of CKD for many people and that prescriber education, follow-up mechanisms and consumer awareness of the importance of remaining on treatment would also be important.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.31.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that funding empagliflozin for CKD may slow the rate at which individuals progress to requiring renal replacement therapies such as dialysis.

The Committee noted that the EMPA-KIDNEY trial excluded people with polycystic kidney disease. The Committee noted that people in New Zealand with polycystic kidney disease have a funded alternative in tolvaptan which reduces the long-term progression of the condition, however the Committee considered that people with polycystic kidney disease would still benefit from empagliflozin.
