However, since the April 2019 meeting, there have been no major new trials published regarding the efficacy of combination anti-CTLA4/anti PD1 agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5. </span>The Subcommittee considered that while toxicity related adverse events are less common with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents than with chemotherapy, there was a small portion of patients treated with ICI agents who experience significant immune-mediated adverse events, which require intensive management and monitoring often over a long period of time and often entailed increased clinic visits, treatment with steroids and ongoing immunosuppressants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ESMO/ACSO guidelines support use of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab) in the treatment of NSCLC in first and second-line settings, either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and other agents depending on patient and cancer characteristics.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on the totality of currently available data, anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents appear to provide the same (or similar) effect in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8. </span>The Subcommittee considered that currently pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have the strongest data for use in the first-line setting for advanced NSCLC; and that data is comparable for atezolizumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab in the second-line. The Subcommittee considered that there is currently a lack of supportive data for avelumab in advanced NSCLC in any setting and for nivolumab in the first-line setting.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a meta-analysis comparing trials of anti PD-1/anti PD-</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">L1 agents as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy across NSCLC histologies and biomarker expression (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31870882/\" target=\"_blank\">Lantuejoul et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2020; 15:499-519</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the studies presented heavily overlapped in patient characteristics and outcomes, indicating a similar level of benefit across the various trial agents and populations. It was also considered that diagnostic thresholds for PD-L1 expression were broadly consistent with 50% and 1% thresholds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a review of first-line anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agent trials for NSCLC, in which approximately half of the studies reviewed had hazard ratios for overall survival whose confidence intervals crossed 1, indicating no statistically significant improvements with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179179/\" target=\"_blank\">Remon et al.

The Subcommittee considered that to date it remained the case that published evidence for the use of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents does not indicate there is a \u2018tail\u2019 of long-term survivors with advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12. </span>The Subcommittee considered a letter regarding the funding of lung cancer treatments in New Zealand from the New Zealand Lung Oncology Special Interest Group (comprising medical oncologists who specialise in the treatment of lung cancer). The Subcommittee noted that, while not unanimous, based on the currently available evidence for use of various agents there was majority support for a class effect for monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in treatment for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while there is variability between trials for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab) in how they stratify by PD-L1 expression, participants are generally grouped based on PD-L1 tumour expression of \u2265 50% (high expression), PD-L1 tumour expression of \u2265 1% (PD-L1 positive), and PD-L1 expression &lt;1% (PD-L1 negative).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although stratification of patients in clinical trials based on PD-L1 expression is relatively consistent across studies, at the current time it is difficult to determine what the downstream immune effects of PD-L1 blockade are and so PD-L1 expression may not be biologically meaningful in defining a patient population for exclusion of benefit of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15. </span>The Subcommittee considered that published data indicates that a higher expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells or surrounding immune stromal cells correlates to a higher response rate from ICI agents.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although patients with high PD-L1 expression appear to benefit most, those with lower expression may also benefit, with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that use of different assays, tumour proportion scores, and PD-L1 expression thresholds may lead to problems with reproducibility and standardisation of testing and by extrapolation the benefits observed in trial populations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that lab-developed tests used in New Zealand may not have the same sensitivity as the tests used in the clinical trials. As a variety of PD-L1 testing platforms are in use in New Zealand, the Subcommittee considered that the true rates of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC for patients in New Zealand may be difficult to estimate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the majority of research regarding the use of immunotherapies for lung cancer to date has been conducted in patients who do not express targetable driver mutations (e.g. EGFR-negative, ALK-negative). Therefore, the Subcommittee considered there continued to be a lack of data to support efficacy of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents in patients with known driver mutations, such that inclusion of these populations in any funding criteria for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents could not currently be supported.\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20. </span>The Subcommittee considered that similarly patients with uncontrolled brain metastases were not included in trial populations, and that in NSCLC this is considered an unfavourable prognostic factor such that it would be appropriate to exclude these patients from funding of these agents.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21. </span>The Subcommittee considered it remained appropriate to limit patients to a single line of treatment with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents which could be administered at any point in the treatment sequence for patients with EGFR wild-type or ALK-negative advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22. </span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to limit the total duration for a course of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment for advanced NSCLC patients to a maximum of two years of continuous treatment. The Subcommittee considered that while it was expected there may be gaps in treatment due to adverse events, as with many oncology treatments, there was a lack of data to support retreatment following disease progression in anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 pre-treated NSCLC patients, and that treatment should cease at signs of disease progression (whether this occurred during continuous treatment or in a period when \u2018off\u2019 treatment).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, while funding for all advanced NSCLC would be the preferred outcome, if targeting was required for fiscal reasons then use of PD-L1 expression would be reasonable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24. </span>The Subcommittee considered there were benefits and shortfalls of a Special Authority criteria mandating PD-L1 testing to determine eligibility for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand, subject to criteria irrespective of PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level did not determine eligibility for funding) that this would allow clinicians to prescribe anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents according to patient needs and clinical judgement. The Subcommittee considered that in this situation it was likely that the majority of patients would receive treatment as a combination regimen with chemotherapy, and only those considered unfit for chemotherapy would likely receive monotherapy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, conversely, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand subject to criteria that mandated PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level was a required determinant of eligibility for funding) use of a 50% threshold would likely be appropriate. The Subcommittee considered that this could target funded treatment to those that may benefit most and limit the overall resource impact for DHBs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if first-line treatment were to be funded for all advanced NSCLC patients (rather than only a high PD-L1 expression population), PD-L1 level would likely be used to determine treatment regimen. The Subcommittee considered that any patients whose disease had high PD-L1 expression (50% or greater) would likely receive anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 monotherapy, with patients whose disease had PD-L1 expression less than 50% who are \u2018fit\u2019 receiving the combination regimen. The Subcommittee considered that in this scenario patients who are \u2018unfit\u2019 to receive chemotherapy and did not have disease with high expression of PD-L1 may not be eligible to receive funded anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that mandating PD-L1 testing would require DHBs to fund and provide tests but may create inequities for patients who are unfit for chemotherapy and may not meet the specified PD-L1 expression threshold.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29. </span>The Subcommittee considered that if PD-L1 testing was not used to specify eligibility for funding, it was uncertain whether testing would be implemented equitably by DHBs. The Subcommittee considered this may result in more patients receiving combination chemotherapy regimens with the additional toxicities and resourcing requirements when comparable benefit could likely be achieved without this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, given these points, it would be reasonable to progress funding for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC subject to criteria with or without specification of PD-L1 based on assessment of the most favourable cost-effectiveness taking in to account the health system impacts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that appropriate criteria in each scenario would be:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>PD-L1 defined population</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">Initial application - (NSCLC first-line) only from a medical oncologist or any relevant practitioner on the recommendation of a medical oncologist.

The Subcommittee considered that while it was expected there may be gaps in treatment due to adverse events, as with many oncology treatments, there was a lack of data to support retreatment following disease progression in anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 pre-treated NSCLC patients, and that treatment should cease at signs of disease progression (whether this occurred during continuous treatment or in a period when \u2018off\u2019 treatment).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, while funding for all advanced NSCLC would be the preferred outcome, if targeting was required for fiscal reasons then use of PD-L1 expression would be reasonable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24. </span>The Subcommittee considered there were benefits and shortfalls of a Special Authority criteria mandating PD-L1 testing to determine eligibility for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand, subject to criteria irrespective of PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level did not determine eligibility for funding) that this would allow clinicians to prescribe anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents according to patient needs and clinical judgement. The Subcommittee considered that in this situation it was likely that the majority of patients would receive treatment as a combination regimen with chemotherapy, and only those considered unfit for chemotherapy would likely receive monotherapy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, conversely, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand subject to criteria that mandated PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level was a required determinant of eligibility for funding) use of a 50% threshold would likely be appropriate.

The Subcommittee considered that in this scenario patients who are \u2018unfit\u2019 to receive chemotherapy and did not have disease with high expression of PD-L1 may not be eligible to receive funded anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that mandating PD-L1 testing would require DHBs to fund and provide tests but may create inequities for patients who are unfit for chemotherapy and may not meet the specified PD-L1 expression threshold.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29. </span>The Subcommittee considered that if PD-L1 testing was not used to specify eligibility for funding, it was uncertain whether testing would be implemented equitably by DHBs.

However, since the April 2019 meeting, there have been no major new trials published regarding the efficacy of combination anti-CTLA4/anti PD1 agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5. </span>The Subcommittee considered that while toxicity related adverse events are less common with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents than with chemotherapy, there was a small portion of patients treated with ICI agents who experience significant immune-mediated adverse events, which require intensive management and monitoring often over a long period of time and often entailed increased clinic visits, treatment with steroids and ongoing immunosuppressants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ESMO/ACSO guidelines support use of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab) in the treatment of NSCLC in first and second-line settings, either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and other agents depending on patient and cancer characteristics.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on the totality of currently available data, anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents appear to provide the same (or similar) effect in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8. </span>The Subcommittee considered that currently pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have the strongest data for use in the first-line setting for advanced NSCLC; and that data is comparable for atezolizumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab in the second-line. The Subcommittee considered that there is currently a lack of supportive data for avelumab in advanced NSCLC in any setting and for nivolumab in the first-line setting.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a meta-analysis comparing trials of anti PD-1/anti PD-</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">L1 agents as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy across NSCLC histologies and biomarker expression (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31870882/\" target=\"_blank\">Lantuejoul et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2020; 15:499-519</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the studies presented heavily overlapped in patient characteristics and outcomes, indicating a similar level of benefit across the various trial agents and populations. It was also considered that diagnostic thresholds for PD-L1 expression were broadly consistent with 50% and 1% thresholds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a review of first-line anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agent trials for NSCLC, in which approximately half of the studies reviewed had hazard ratios for overall survival whose confidence intervals crossed 1, indicating no statistically significant improvements with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179179/\" target=\"_blank\">Remon et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2020;15:914-47</a>).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11. </span>The Subcommittee reiterated that based on the currently available evidence (across multiple trials and agents) the overall survival gain for NSCLC patients with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents was approximately 3 months irrespective of treatment line. The Subcommittee considered that to date it remained the case that published evidence for the use of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents does not indicate there is a \u2018tail\u2019 of long-term survivors with advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12. </span>The Subcommittee considered a letter regarding the funding of lung cancer treatments in New Zealand from the New Zealand Lung Oncology Special Interest Group (comprising medical oncologists who specialise in the treatment of lung cancer). The Subcommittee noted that, while not unanimous, based on the currently available evidence for use of various agents there was majority support for a class effect for monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in treatment for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while there is variability between trials for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab) in how they stratify by PD-L1 expression, participants are generally grouped based on PD-L1 tumour expression of \u2265 50% (high expression), PD-L1 tumour expression of \u2265 1% (PD-L1 positive), and PD-L1 expression &lt;1% (PD-L1 negative).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although stratification of patients in clinical trials based on PD-L1 expression is relatively consistent across studies, at the current time it is difficult to determine what the downstream immune effects of PD-L1 blockade are and so PD-L1 expression may not be biologically meaningful in defining a patient population for exclusion of benefit of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15. </span>The Subcommittee considered that published data indicates that a higher expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells or surrounding immune stromal cells correlates to a higher response rate from ICI agents.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although patients with high PD-L1 expression appear to benefit most, those with lower expression may also benefit, with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that use of different assays, tumour proportion scores, and PD-L1 expression thresholds may lead to problems with reproducibility and standardisation of testing and by extrapolation the benefits observed in trial populations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that lab-developed tests used in New Zealand may not have the same sensitivity as the tests used in the clinical trials. As a variety of PD-L1 testing platforms are in use in New Zealand, the Subcommittee considered that the true rates of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC for patients in New Zealand may be difficult to estimate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the majority of research regarding the use of immunotherapies for lung cancer to date has been conducted in patients who do not express targetable driver mutations (e.g. EGFR-negative, ALK-negative). Therefore, the Subcommittee considered there continued to be a lack of data to support efficacy of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents in patients with known driver mutations, such that inclusion of these populations in any funding criteria for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents could not currently be supported.\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20. </span>The Subcommittee considered that similarly patients with uncontrolled brain metastases were not included in trial populations, and that in NSCLC this is considered an unfavourable prognostic factor such that it would be appropriate to exclude these patients from funding of these agents.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21. </span>The Subcommittee considered it remained appropriate to limit patients to a single line of treatment with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents which could be administered at any point in the treatment sequence for patients with EGFR wild-type or ALK-negative advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22. </span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to limit the total duration for a course of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment for advanced NSCLC patients to a maximum of two years of continuous treatment. The Subcommittee considered that while it was expected there may be gaps in treatment due to adverse events, as with many oncology treatments, there was a lack of data to support retreatment following disease progression in anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 pre-treated NSCLC patients, and that treatment should cease at signs of disease progression (whether this occurred during continuous treatment or in a period when \u2018off\u2019 treatment).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, while funding for all advanced NSCLC would be the preferred outcome, if targeting was required for fiscal reasons then use of PD-L1 expression would be reasonable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24. </span>The Subcommittee considered there were benefits and shortfalls of a Special Authority criteria mandating PD-L1 testing to determine eligibility for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand, subject to criteria irrespective of PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level did not determine eligibility for funding) that this would allow clinicians to prescribe anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents according to patient needs and clinical judgement. The Subcommittee considered that in this situation it was likely that the majority of patients would receive treatment as a combination regimen with chemotherapy, and only those considered unfit for chemotherapy would likely receive monotherapy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, conversely, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand subject to criteria that mandated PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level was a required determinant of eligibility for funding) use of a 50% threshold would likely be appropriate. The Subcommittee considered that this could target funded treatment to those that may benefit most and limit the overall resource impact for DHBs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if first-line treatment were to be funded for all advanced NSCLC patients (rather than only a high PD-L1 expression population), PD-L1 level would likely be used to determine treatment regimen. The Subcommittee considered that any patients whose disease had high PD-L1 expression (50% or greater) would likely receive anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 monotherapy, with patients whose disease had PD-L1 expression less than 50% who are \u2018fit\u2019 receiving the combination regimen. The Subcommittee considered that in this scenario patients who are \u2018unfit\u2019 to receive chemotherapy and did not have disease with high expression of PD-L1 may not be eligible to receive funded anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that mandating PD-L1 testing would require DHBs to fund and provide tests but may create inequities for patients who are unfit for chemotherapy and may not meet the specified PD-L1 expression threshold.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29. </span>The Subcommittee considered that if PD-L1 testing was not used to specify eligibility for funding, it was uncertain whether testing would be implemented equitably by DHBs. The Subcommittee considered this may result in more patients receiving combination chemotherapy regimens with the additional toxicities and resourcing requirements when comparable benefit could likely be achieved without this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, given these points, it would be reasonable to progress funding for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC subject to criteria with or without specification of PD-L1 based on assessment of the most favourable cost-effectiveness taking in to account the health system impacts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that appropriate criteria in each scenario would be:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>PD-L1 defined population</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">Initial application - (NSCLC first-line) only from a medical oncologist or any relevant practitioner on the recommendation of a medical oncologist.
