The Committee noted that RA is diagnosed clinically and that if untreated or unresponsive to therapy, inflammation and joint destruction lead to loss of physical function, inability to carry out daily tasks, and employment difficulties. The Committee noted that patients with RA have an increased risk of earlier death from all causes and have higher mortality from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases compared to people without RA. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that New Zealand epidemiology data were limited, but noted that the overall prevalence of diagnosed RA is about 2.6%, equivalent to about 101,000 adults (over 15 years of age) with RA (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/surveys/new-zealand-health-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, New Zealand Heath Survey 2018-19</a>). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and Asian populations are also affected by RA, with 2016/2017 prevalence of 2.3% in M\u0101ori (2018/2019 prevalence of 1.9%), 1.4% in Pacific peoples and 1.3% in Asian populations. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that indicated the magnitude of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impact from RA is similar to that of other chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure and clinical depression (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2018.1\" target=\"_blank\">Smolen et al. Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2018;4:18001</a>). The Committee noted that a high Disease Activity Score (DAS) indicates active RA, whereas a low DAS indicates a state of almost complete remission, and members considered that the HRQOL of patients with RA and a low DAS is similar to individuals without RA. The Committee noted that the DAS28-CRP measure, which is used in many RA clinical trials, is a composite measure of C-reactive protein (CRP) and of inflammation in 28 joints, although it excludes the small joints of the feet which are commonly involved in RA. The Committee considered that the ACR70 is a useful measure of disease response to treatment in RA clinical trials and is more desirable than the ACR20 or ACR50. </p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the intention for early, intensive treatment of RA to prevent joint damage and maintain quality of life. The Committee noted the aim of treatment is disease remission or a state of low disease activity. The Committee noted that initial treatment of RA in New Zealand typically uses conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs); initially with methotrexate alone and increasing to triple therapy if needed (or as initial treatment for severe presenting disease) with the addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, then using leflunomide with or without methotrexate if disease remission is not achieved. The Committee considered that co-prescribed leflunomide and methotrexate is not commonly used in other markets i.e. US and Europe, likely due to the increased risk of toxicity. For patients with disease of a severity that meets the relevant funding restriction criteria, first-line biologic DMARDs (adalimumab or etanercept, usually with methotrexate) and second-line biologic DMARDs (infliximab, rituximab and tocilizumab) may be used, with some patients cycling between these treatments within each line to achieve and maintain disease control, even if this disease control is suboptimal. The Committee considered a severe disease state is required to access funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The Committee noted prednisone may be taken by patients throughout the treatment paradigm for RA if required. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the patient population with moderate to severe RA that has been failed by all funded treatments will continue to increase over time, and considered that these patients have an ongoing need for new and effective funded treatments. The Committee considered that patients with moderate to severe RA for whom tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors i.e. adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, are contraindicated due to heart failure would be eligible to receive rituximab or tocilizumab, which are administered by intravenous infusion and therefore imparts a greater cost on patients, family/wh\u0101nau and the health system compared with subcutaneous adalimumab or etanercept.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1, a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of enzymes, which is inhibited more potently by upadacitinib than JAK2 and JAK3; this action interrupts the IL-6 signalling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and the immune response. Members considered that this potent inhibition of JAK1 may be responsible for differences in safety and efficacy between inhibitors of JAK1 and of JAK2. The Committee noted upadacitinib is a targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that AbbVie\u2019s brand (Rinvoq) of upadacitinib, an oral tablet taken one daily at a dose of 15 mg, is Medsafe registered for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other csDMARDs. The Committee noted the application requested funding for the 15 mg daily dose in particular.

The Committee considered that, if funded, use of upadacitinib would reduce the infusion resource required for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe RA, noting that infusion services in New Zealand are used for treatment of many conditions and currently operate at or near capacity.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that some formulations e.g. oral, offer advantages over others e.g. injection, for paediatric patients, although no evidence for the use of upadacitinib in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was identified at this time. The Committee considered that advice from the Rheumatology Subcommittee should be sought regarding whether there is evidence for the use of upadacitinib and other JAK inhibitors e.g. tofacitinib, in children with JIA, and considered that a small group of children who have tried all other treatment options may seek funded access to upadacitinib.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that additional blood tests e.g. for lipid monitoring, and the cost of a non-live shingles vaccine should be included in the overall cost of upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded, there would likely be a reduction in both the number of patients on first-line TNF inhibitors (adalimumab and etanercept) and the number of patients requiring IV-administered treatments for RA. The Committee considered that, in a second-line setting, it was uncertain whether upadacitinib would primarily be used after failure of one or two TNF inhibitors, and that the Rheumatology Subcommittee could advise on upadacitinib\u2019s place in the treatment algorithm and appropriate Special Authority access criteria for upadacitinib for RA.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the patient numbers estimated by PHARMAC staff, which assumed an expansion in the population receiving biologic or tsDMARD treatment of 10%, and high early uptake reflective of a bolus of patients moving onto upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that the assumptions used by PHARMAC staff in the budget impact analysis were reasonable and consistent with prior clinical advice, and would likely be similar for tofacitinib. The Committee considered that there may be high uptake of oral tablets, and this would be driven by patient preference; the Committee also considered that, if funded with the same access criteria as adalimumab and etanercept, upadacitinib may be prescribed for greater than 40% of biologic-na\u00efve patients with RA.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded for use in any line of therapy for RA, a small number of patients currently on other therapies may elect to switch from their current therapy to upadacitinib; possibly due to poorly managed disease despite other treatment, or reliance on another person e.g. a nurse, for treatment administration.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that RA is diagnosed clinically and that if untreated or unresponsive to therapy, inflammation and joint destruction lead to loss of physical function, inability to carry out daily tasks, and employment difficulties. The Committee noted that patients with RA have an increased risk of earlier death from all causes and have higher mortality from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases compared to people without RA. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that New Zealand epidemiology data were limited, but noted that the overall prevalence of diagnosed RA is about 2.6%, equivalent to about 101,000 adults (over 15 years of age) with RA (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/surveys/new-zealand-health-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, New Zealand Heath Survey 2018-19</a>). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and Asian populations are also affected by RA, with 2016/2017 prevalence of 2.3% in M\u0101ori (2018/2019 prevalence of 1.9%), 1.4% in Pacific peoples and 1.3% in Asian populations. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that indicated the magnitude of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impact from RA is similar to that of other chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure and clinical depression (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2018.1\" target=\"_blank\">Smolen et al. Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2018;4:18001</a>). The Committee noted that a high Disease Activity Score (DAS) indicates active RA, whereas a low DAS indicates a state of almost complete remission, and members considered that the HRQOL of patients with RA and a low DAS is similar to individuals without RA. The Committee noted that the DAS28-CRP measure, which is used in many RA clinical trials, is a composite measure of C-reactive protein (CRP) and of inflammation in 28 joints, although it excludes the small joints of the feet which are commonly involved in RA. The Committee considered that the ACR70 is a useful measure of disease response to treatment in RA clinical trials and is more desirable than the ACR20 or ACR50. </p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the intention for early, intensive treatment of RA to prevent joint damage and maintain quality of life. The Committee noted the aim of treatment is disease remission or a state of low disease activity. The Committee noted that initial treatment of RA in New Zealand typically uses conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs); initially with methotrexate alone and increasing to triple therapy if needed (or as initial treatment for severe presenting disease) with the addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, then using leflunomide with or without methotrexate if disease remission is not achieved. The Committee considered that co-prescribed leflunomide and methotrexate is not commonly used in other markets i.e. US and Europe, likely due to the increased risk of toxicity. For patients with disease of a severity that meets the relevant funding restriction criteria, first-line biologic DMARDs (adalimumab or etanercept, usually with methotrexate) and second-line biologic DMARDs (infliximab, rituximab and tocilizumab) may be used, with some patients cycling between these treatments within each line to achieve and maintain disease control, even if this disease control is suboptimal. The Committee considered a severe disease state is required to access funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The Committee noted prednisone may be taken by patients throughout the treatment paradigm for RA if required. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the patient population with moderate to severe RA that has been failed by all funded treatments will continue to increase over time, and considered that these patients have an ongoing need for new and effective funded treatments. The Committee considered that patients with moderate to severe RA for whom tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors i.e. adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, are contraindicated due to heart failure would be eligible to receive rituximab or tocilizumab, which are administered by intravenous infusion and therefore imparts a greater cost on patients, family/wh\u0101nau and the health system compared with subcutaneous adalimumab or etanercept.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1, a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of enzymes, which is inhibited more potently by upadacitinib than JAK2 and JAK3; this action interrupts the IL-6 signalling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and the immune response. Members considered that this potent inhibition of JAK1 may be responsible for differences in safety and efficacy between inhibitors of JAK1 and of JAK2. The Committee noted upadacitinib is a targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that AbbVie\u2019s brand (Rinvoq) of upadacitinib, an oral tablet taken one daily at a dose of 15 mg, is Medsafe registered for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other csDMARDs. The Committee noted the application requested funding for the 15 mg daily dose in particular. The Committee noted that upadacitinib is proposed by the applicant to be funded as a first- or subsequent-biologic/targeted treatment instead of currently funded first-line biologics i.e. adalimumab and etanercept. The Committee noted PHARMAC had also requested consideration of upadacitinib as a second-line bDMARD/tsDMARD, following an inadequate response to treatment with a first-line bDMARD, typically adalimumab. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, targets JAK1 and JAK3 and that a funding application for tofacitinib for the treatment of active RA was considered by PTAC in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2019</a> and is currently ranked. At that time, PTAC recommended that tofacitinib be funded with a medium priority for patients with RA under the same Special Authority criteria in place for adalimumab and etanercept, and also that it be funded with a medium priority for patients with moderate to severe RA who were not adequately responding to TNF inhibitors, subject to Special Authority criteria recommended by the Rheumatology Subcommittee.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the key evidence for upadacitinib in adults with RA comes from five clinical trials:</p><p>1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>SELECT-EARLY (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41384\" target=\"_blank\">van Vollenhoven et al.

The Committee considered that the data suggested a likely class effect in terms of ACR70 and DAS28-CRP benefit from JAK inhibitors in moderate to severe RA, however, updated review of the evidence for tofacitinib in this population would be beneficial to inform assessment of a class effect. The Committee considered that advice from the Rheumatology Subcommittee should be sought regarding whether there is a class effect among JAK inhibitors in this setting. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence suggests upadacitinib may provide a greater benefit than adalimumab in this population, and was made aware of indirect evidence that suggests upadacitinib plus methotrexate appears more effective than adalimumab, however tofacitinib plus methotrexate appears not superior to adalimumab (<a href=\"https://icer.org/assessment/rheumatoid-arthritis-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al. Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. 2020</a>). The Committee considered that there is evidence of a greater benefit from upadacitinib compared with methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe RA, and that upadacitinib monotherapy is effective in this patient population. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that it was difficult to determine whether upadacitinib would provide the same or similar therapeutic outcome as oral tofacitinib for patients with moderate to severe RA. However, the Committee noted two indirect comparison network meta-analyses for ACR and DAS28-CRP outcomes after 12 and 24 weeks of combination treatments including JAK inhibitors compared to conventional synthetic and bDMARDs; these report a higher ordinal surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking for upadacitinib than for other treatments including tofacitinib, indicating a higher probability that upadacitinib is preferred, although this was not indicative of any difference in magnitude of treatment effect and some results were not statistically significant (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32297280/\" target=\"_blank\">Pope et al.

Members considered that if only one of these agents (tofacitinib or upadacitinib) were funded for moderate to severe RA in New Zealand, upadacitinib may be preferred as the indirect evidence shows a trend towards superiority over tofacitinib, although this was highly uncertain based on the evidence to date. The Committee considered the Rheumatology Subcommittee would be best placed to consider the evidence and the potential class effect of JAK inhibitors. Members considered that the funding of either upadacitinib or tofacitinib would help address an unmet need for patients who were unable to achieve optimal disease response on currently funded treatments.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that although the evidence suggests an initial period of durable response, loss of benefit may be seen with upadacitinib in RA and this loss of benefit would be likely to be due to the complex nature of RA rather than anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can be a limiting factor for treatment benefit with TNF inhibitors but would not be expected with upadacitinib.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there was limited evidence for switching and sequencing of upadacitinib and other treatments for RA, and considered that it was unclear whether upadacitinib would provide the greatest benefit when used in the first-line or second-line and what the optimal sequencing of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs would be for this patient population, although observational data suggests that upadacitinib is effective when used after adalimumab. The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded for use in any line, given the available evidence, it could be appropriate for a decision on its use to be at the clinician\u2019s and patient\u2019s discretion. The Committee considered that advice from the Rheumatology Subcommittee should be sought regarding appropriate sequencing of upadacitinib and other treatments for RA.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence suggests there is a class effect for adverse events from JAK inhibitors, and was made aware of evidence for both doses of upadacitinib from the five SELECT trials in which there was a statistically significant increased risk of herpes zoster (shingles) with upadacitinib compared with methotrexate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.997 and 3.023 for 15 mg and 30 mg, respectively) and adalimumab (HR 3.221 and 4.989, respectively) (<a href=\"https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/3/304\" target=\"_blank\">Cohen et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2020;annrheumdis-2020-218510; Supplementary Table S4</a>). The Committee noted that a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccination e.g. Zostervax is contraindicated in patients receiving biologic treatment, therefore a non-live vaccine e.g. Shingrix, would be required in the patient population receiving a biologic treatment for RA.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, like tocilizumab, upadacitinib is associated with elevated HDL and LDL cholesterol levels which can convey an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for some patients, although it was unclear whether this was a clinically significant risk in the context of RA. The Committee was made aware of a meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled trials that included almost 12,000 patients who received JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib, which reported that the increase in risk of CVD was not significant (<a href=\"https://ard.bmj.com/lookup/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=31088790\" target=\"_blank\">Xie et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2019;78:1048-54</a>). The Committee considered that although this may not be a significant risk, lipid monitoring may be appropriate during treatment with upadacitinib.\u00a0</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that the safety profile of upadacitinib was otherwise as expected for JAK inhibitors, without an increased risk of pulmonary embolism seen with use of higher doses of tofacitinib (as used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease).</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the oral formulation of upadacitinib would offer suitability benefits in terms of convenience and ease of administration compared with subcutaneous (which require syringe disposal) or intravenous administration. The Committee considered that, if funded, use of upadacitinib would reduce the infusion resource required for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe RA, noting that infusion services in New Zealand are used for treatment of many conditions and currently operate at or near capacity.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that some formulations e.g. oral, offer advantages over others e.g. injection, for paediatric patients, although no evidence for the use of upadacitinib in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was identified at this time. The Committee considered that advice from the Rheumatology Subcommittee should be sought regarding whether there is evidence for the use of upadacitinib and other JAK inhibitors e.g. tofacitinib, in children with JIA, and considered that a small group of children who have tried all other treatment options may seek funded access to upadacitinib.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that additional blood tests e.g. for lipid monitoring, and the cost of a non-live shingles vaccine should be included in the overall cost of upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded, there would likely be a reduction in both the number of patients on first-line TNF inhibitors (adalimumab and etanercept) and the number of patients requiring IV-administered treatments for RA. The Committee considered that, in a second-line setting, it was uncertain whether upadacitinib would primarily be used after failure of one or two TNF inhibitors, and that the Rheumatology Subcommittee could advise on upadacitinib\u2019s place in the treatment algorithm and appropriate Special Authority access criteria for upadacitinib for RA.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the patient numbers estimated by PHARMAC staff, which assumed an expansion in the population receiving biologic or tsDMARD treatment of 10%, and high early uptake reflective of a bolus of patients moving onto upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that the assumptions used by PHARMAC staff in the budget impact analysis were reasonable and consistent with prior clinical advice, and would likely be similar for tofacitinib. The Committee considered that there may be high uptake of oral tablets, and this would be driven by patient preference; the Committee also considered that, if funded with the same access criteria as adalimumab and etanercept, upadacitinib may be prescribed for greater than 40% of biologic-na\u00efve patients with RA.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded for use in any line of therapy for RA, a small number of patients currently on other therapies may elect to switch from their current therapy to upadacitinib; possibly due to poorly managed disease despite other treatment, or reliance on another person e.g. a nurse, for treatment administration.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that RA is diagnosed clinically and that if untreated or unresponsive to therapy, inflammation and joint destruction lead to loss of physical function, inability to carry out daily tasks, and employment difficulties. The Committee noted that patients with RA have an increased risk of earlier death from all causes and have higher mortality from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases compared to people without RA. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that New Zealand epidemiology data were limited, but noted that the overall prevalence of diagnosed RA is about 2.6%, equivalent to about 101,000 adults (over 15 years of age) with RA (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/surveys/new-zealand-health-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, New Zealand Heath Survey 2018-19</a>). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and Asian populations are also affected by RA, with 2016/2017 prevalence of 2.3% in M\u0101ori (2018/2019 prevalence of 1.9%), 1.4% in Pacific peoples and 1.3% in Asian populations. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that indicated the magnitude of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impact from RA is similar to that of other chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure and clinical depression (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2018.1\" target=\"_blank\">Smolen et al. Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2018;4:18001</a>). The Committee noted that a high Disease Activity Score (DAS) indicates active RA, whereas a low DAS indicates a state of almost complete remission, and members considered that the HRQOL of patients with RA and a low DAS is similar to individuals without RA. The Committee noted that the DAS28-CRP measure, which is used in many RA clinical trials, is a composite measure of C-reactive protein (CRP) and of inflammation in 28 joints, although it excludes the small joints of the feet which are commonly involved in RA. The Committee considered that the ACR70 is a useful measure of disease response to treatment in RA clinical trials and is more desirable than the ACR20 or ACR50. </p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the intention for early, intensive treatment of RA to prevent joint damage and maintain quality of life. The Committee noted the aim of treatment is disease remission or a state of low disease activity. The Committee noted that initial treatment of RA in New Zealand typically uses conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs); initially with methotrexate alone and increasing to triple therapy if needed (or as initial treatment for severe presenting disease) with the addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, then using leflunomide with or without methotrexate if disease remission is not achieved. The Committee considered that co-prescribed leflunomide and methotrexate is not commonly used in other markets i.e. US and Europe, likely due to the increased risk of toxicity. For patients with disease of a severity that meets the relevant funding restriction criteria, first-line biologic DMARDs (adalimumab or etanercept, usually with methotrexate) and second-line biologic DMARDs (infliximab, rituximab and tocilizumab) may be used, with some patients cycling between these treatments within each line to achieve and maintain disease control, even if this disease control is suboptimal. The Committee considered a severe disease state is required to access funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The Committee noted prednisone may be taken by patients throughout the treatment paradigm for RA if required. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the patient population with moderate to severe RA that has been failed by all funded treatments will continue to increase over time, and considered that these patients have an ongoing need for new and effective funded treatments. The Committee considered that patients with moderate to severe RA for whom tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors i.e. adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, are contraindicated due to heart failure would be eligible to receive rituximab or tocilizumab, which are administered by intravenous infusion and therefore imparts a greater cost on patients, family/wh\u0101nau and the health system compared with subcutaneous adalimumab or etanercept.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1, a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of enzymes, which is inhibited more potently by upadacitinib than JAK2 and JAK3; this action interrupts the IL-6 signalling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and the immune response. Members considered that this potent inhibition of JAK1 may be responsible for differences in safety and efficacy between inhibitors of JAK1 and of JAK2.

The Committee noted the application requested funding for the 15 mg daily dose in particular. The Committee noted that upadacitinib is proposed by the applicant to be funded as a first- or subsequent-biologic/targeted treatment instead of currently funded first-line biologics i.e. adalimumab and etanercept. The Committee noted PHARMAC had also requested consideration of upadacitinib as a second-line bDMARD/tsDMARD, following an inadequate response to treatment with a first-line bDMARD, typically adalimumab. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, targets JAK1 and JAK3 and that a funding application for tofacitinib for the treatment of active RA was considered by PTAC in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2019</a> and is currently ranked.

The Committee noted that a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccination e.g. Zostervax is contraindicated in patients receiving biologic treatment, therefore a non-live vaccine e.g. Shingrix, would be required in the patient population receiving a biologic treatment for RA.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, like tocilizumab, upadacitinib is associated with elevated HDL and LDL cholesterol levels which can convey an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for some patients, although it was unclear whether this was a clinically significant risk in the context of RA. The Committee was made aware of a meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled trials that included almost 12,000 patients who received JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib, which reported that the increase in risk of CVD was not significant (<a href=\"https://ard.bmj.com/lookup/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=31088790\" target=\"_blank\">Xie et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2019;78:1048-54</a>). The Committee considered that although this may not be a significant risk, lipid monitoring may be appropriate during treatment with upadacitinib.\u00a0</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that the safety profile of upadacitinib was otherwise as expected for JAK inhibitors, without an increased risk of pulmonary embolism seen with use of higher doses of tofacitinib (as used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease).</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the oral formulation of upadacitinib would offer suitability benefits in terms of convenience and ease of administration compared with subcutaneous (which require syringe disposal) or intravenous administration. The Committee considered that, if funded, use of upadacitinib would reduce the infusion resource required for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe RA, noting that infusion services in New Zealand are used for treatment of many conditions and currently operate at or near capacity.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that some formulations e.g. oral, offer advantages over others e.g. injection, for paediatric patients, although no evidence for the use of upadacitinib in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was identified at this time. The Committee considered that advice from the Rheumatology Subcommittee should be sought regarding whether there is evidence for the use of upadacitinib and other JAK inhibitors e.g. tofacitinib, in children with JIA, and considered that a small group of children who have tried all other treatment options may seek funded access to upadacitinib.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that additional blood tests e.g. for lipid monitoring, and the cost of a non-live shingles vaccine should be included in the overall cost of upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded, there would likely be a reduction in both the number of patients on first-line TNF inhibitors (adalimumab and etanercept) and the number of patients requiring IV-administered treatments for RA. The Committee considered that, in a second-line setting, it was uncertain whether upadacitinib would primarily be used after failure of one or two TNF inhibitors, and that the Rheumatology Subcommittee could advise on upadacitinib\u2019s place in the treatment algorithm and appropriate Special Authority access criteria for upadacitinib for RA.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the patient numbers estimated by PHARMAC staff, which assumed an expansion in the population receiving biologic or tsDMARD treatment of 10%, and high early uptake reflective of a bolus of patients moving onto upadacitinib treatment. The Committee considered that the assumptions used by PHARMAC staff in the budget impact analysis were reasonable and consistent with prior clinical advice, and would likely be similar for tofacitinib. The Committee considered that there may be high uptake of oral tablets, and this would be driven by patient preference; the Committee also considered that, if funded with the same access criteria as adalimumab and etanercept, upadacitinib may be prescribed for greater than 40% of biologic-na\u00efve patients with RA.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if upadacitinib were funded for use in any line of therapy for RA, a small number of patients currently on other therapies may elect to switch from their current therapy to upadacitinib; possibly due to poorly managed disease despite other treatment, or reliance on another person e.g. a nurse, for treatment administration.\u00a0</p>",
