The Subcommittee noted that denosumab has been used internationally in osteoporosis for more than a decade including use as a first-line agent in many countries, including Australia.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that denosumab was funded in New Zealand for the treatment of osteoporosis subject to Special Authority criteria in 2018. The Subcommittee noted that some patients with osteoporosis who would benefit from denosumab are unable to access it through the current Special Authority criteria and considered there was a lack of clarity among clinicians with regards to the current criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria result in a significant unmet health need for some patients who would receive health benefit from access to funded denosumab and do not have funded alternatives available to them.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered the current Special Authority criteria require prior treatment with bisphosphonates in patients where the use of bisphosphonates may be unsafe (ie in patients with renal impairment) and is inconsistent with clinical guidelines. However, the Subcommittee considered it possible that in some cases, some use of bisphosphonates may occur in practice with modified dosing schedules (eg once a month instead of once weekly treatment) for patients with few suitable options, such as those with significant renal impairment or those where benefits would outweigh risks, such as those with a high risk of fracture. Members considered that this would likely occur as a result of no effective funded alternatives.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that other funded treatments for osteoporosis include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, such as intravenous zoledronic acid.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Intolerance or contraindication to bisphosphonates</p><p>1.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that while some patients may experience minor adverse effects after infusion of bisphosphonates, there was an unmet need for patients who truly cannot tolerate first-line treatment with bisphosphonates eg patients very unwell and requiring hospitalisation, or those experiencing gastrointestinal issues with oral bisphosphonates (which the Subcommittee considered may occur in up to one in five people). The Subcommittee considered that there was a need for an effective alternative agent for reducing fracture risk, as an alternative to first-line bisphosphonates.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients may be considered to be intolerant to oral bisphosphonates due to malabsorption issues, oesophageal dysphagia or extensive gastrointestinal surgery, and that malabsorption may impair treatment efficacy.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients could be considered to be intolerant to bisphosphonates for other reasons, such as inflammatory eye disease (rare, but occurring in approximately 6 per 1,000 people) or acute phase reaction (occurring in up to 1 in 5 people, with very severe acute phase reactions in 1 in 200 people); these would preclude patients from safely receiving further treatment with bisphosphonates. Members considered that for the purposes of targeting funded treatment with denosumab, intolerance to bisphosphonates should be carefully defined.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people with renal failure (defined as having eGFR &lt;35 ml/min) comprise a significant proportion of patients within the group of patients for whom bisphosphonates are considered to be contraindicated, as bisphosphonates are renally excreted whereas denosumab is not renally excreted. The Subcommittee noted that clinical trials of bisphosphonates excluded people with eGFR of 35 or less, however, trials with denosumab did not exclude people with eGFR of 35 or less. The Subcommittee noted that, based on the evidence for denosumab in this patient subgroup, denosumab is considered to be safe in patients with renal failure. The Subcommittee considered that it was important to retain a criterion in the denosumab Special Authority for renal function and considered that eGFR was a more relevant measure than creatinine clearance.</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted in a US study that, among patients with osteoporosis, 23.8% had renal impairment of eGFR &lt;35 ml/min (Klawansky et al. Osteoporos Int 2003;14:570-6). The Subcommittee considered the likely prevalence in New Zealand to be lower than this.</p><p><br></p><p>Administration</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people who were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to, oral bisphosphonates (eg due to gastrointestinal malabsorption) could reasonably seek access to intravenous bisphosphonates, if available and accessible. However, the Subcommittee considered that there are access inequities resulting from lack of access to funded infusion services and inability to afford unfunded infusion services at a cost of up to $200 per patient per infusion.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that despite the cost of a pharmaceutical (such as zoledronic acid) being funded, administration costs may be incurred by patients as not all treatment centres fund intravenous infusions and access to unfunded infusion services is variable around the country. The Subcommittee considered that the intravenous administration fee paid by patients, required in some areas in order to receive funded intravenous treatment in the community presents a barrier to access for many patients. The Subcommittee considered that amending funding criteria would support equitable access to an effective treatment option for patients who cannot access infusion services to receive intravenous treatment.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that almost all people who would receive denosumab would self-administer as it is a subcutaneous injection, however, some patients may have this administered by a district nurse or receive injections in a rest home.

Therefore, the Subcommittee supported widening access to include these patients in the amended criteria for denosumab. The Subcommittee considered it was uncertain how many patients would experience bone loss on first-line bisphosphonate therapy and may therefore require a second-line therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>1.27.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for denosumab could be refined to better align with standard recommendations and detail clinical criteria reflecting an intolerance of bisphosphonates, or inability to access intravenous bisphosphonates. The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would accurately target those intended for funding and that removing the criteria describing adequate doses of antiresorptive agents would not be likely to increase the number of patients accessing denosumab.</p><p><br></p><p>1.28.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients with intolerance to bisphosphonates currently have no effective funded alternative treatment and therefore the Subcommittee supported widening access to denosumab to provide such an alternative. The Subcommittee noted that this group would include patients who were unable to access intravenous treatment due to cost, although the size of this patient subgroup was unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>1.29.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that while appropriate use of denosumab would be as a second-line agent in most cases, there would be clear delineation in clinical practice between first line use of bisphosphonates (if not contraindicated), and then denosumab if bisphosphonates were contraindicated or not tolerated.</p>', 'fs': '<p>1.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against a key signalling protein for osteoclast development. The Subcommittee noted that denosumab has been used internationally in osteoporosis for more than a decade including use as a first-line agent in many countries, including Australia.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that denosumab was funded in New Zealand for the treatment of osteoporosis subject to Special Authority criteria in 2018. The Subcommittee noted that some patients with osteoporosis who would benefit from denosumab are unable to access it through the current Special Authority criteria and considered there was a lack of clarity among clinicians with regards to the current criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria result in a significant unmet health need for some patients who would receive health benefit from access to funded denosumab and do not have funded alternatives available to them.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered the current Special Authority criteria require prior treatment with bisphosphonates in patients where the use of bisphosphonates may be unsafe (ie in patients with renal impairment) and is inconsistent with clinical guidelines. However, the Subcommittee considered it possible that in some cases, some use of bisphosphonates may occur in practice with modified dosing schedules (eg once a month instead of once weekly treatment) for patients with few suitable options, such as those with significant renal impairment or those where benefits would outweigh risks, such as those with a high risk of fracture. Members considered that this would likely occur as a result of no effective funded alternatives.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that other funded treatments for osteoporosis include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, such as intravenous zoledronic acid.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Intolerance or contraindication to bisphosphonates</p><p>1.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that while some patients may experience minor adverse effects after infusion of bisphosphonates, there was an unmet need for patients who truly cannot tolerate first-line treatment with bisphosphonates eg patients very unwell and requiring hospitalisation, or those experiencing gastrointestinal issues with oral bisphosphonates (which the Subcommittee considered may occur in up to one in five people). The Subcommittee considered that there was a need for an effective alternative agent for reducing fracture risk, as an alternative to first-line bisphosphonates.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients may be considered to be intolerant to oral bisphosphonates due to malabsorption issues, oesophageal dysphagia or extensive gastrointestinal surgery, and that malabsorption may impair treatment efficacy.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients could be considered to be intolerant to bisphosphonates for other reasons, such as inflammatory eye disease (rare, but occurring in approximately 6 per 1,000 people) or acute phase reaction (occurring in up to 1 in 5 people, with very severe acute phase reactions in 1 in 200 people); these would preclude patients from safely receiving further treatment with bisphosphonates. Members considered that for the purposes of targeting funded treatment with denosumab, intolerance to bisphosphonates should be carefully defined.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people with renal failure (defined as having eGFR &lt;35 ml/min) comprise a significant proportion of patients within the group of patients for whom bisphosphonates are considered to be contraindicated, as bisphosphonates are renally excreted whereas denosumab is not renally excreted. The Subcommittee noted that clinical trials of bisphosphonates excluded people with eGFR of 35 or less, however, trials with denosumab did not exclude people with eGFR of 35 or less. The Subcommittee noted that, based on the evidence for denosumab in this patient subgroup, denosumab is considered to be safe in patients with renal failure. The Subcommittee considered that it was important to retain a criterion in the denosumab Special Authority for renal function and considered that eGFR was a more relevant measure than creatinine clearance.</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted in a US study that, among patients with osteoporosis, 23.8% had renal impairment of eGFR &lt;35 ml/min (Klawansky et al.

The Subcommittee considered the likely prevalence in New Zealand to be lower than this.</p><p><br></p><p>Administration</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people who were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to, oral bisphosphonates (eg due to gastrointestinal malabsorption) could reasonably seek access to intravenous bisphosphonates, if available and accessible. However, the Subcommittee considered that there are access inequities resulting from lack of access to funded infusion services and inability to afford unfunded infusion services at a cost of up to $200 per patient per infusion.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that despite the cost of a pharmaceutical (such as zoledronic acid) being funded, administration costs may be incurred by patients as not all treatment centres fund intravenous infusions and access to unfunded infusion services is variable around the country. The Subcommittee considered that the intravenous administration fee paid by patients, required in some areas in order to receive funded intravenous treatment in the community presents a barrier to access for many patients. The Subcommittee considered that amending funding criteria would support equitable access to an effective treatment option for patients who cannot access infusion services to receive intravenous treatment.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that almost all people who would receive denosumab would self-administer as it is a subcutaneous injection, however, some patients may have this administered by a district nurse or receive injections in a rest home.

The Subcommittee noted that denosumab has been used internationally in osteoporosis for more than a decade including use as a first-line agent in many countries, including Australia.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that denosumab was funded in New Zealand for the treatment of osteoporosis subject to Special Authority criteria in 2018. The Subcommittee noted that some patients with osteoporosis who would benefit from denosumab are unable to access it through the current Special Authority criteria and considered there was a lack of clarity among clinicians with regards to the current criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria result in a significant unmet health need for some patients who would receive health benefit from access to funded denosumab and do not have funded alternatives available to them.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered the current Special Authority criteria require prior treatment with bisphosphonates in patients where the use of bisphosphonates may be unsafe (ie in patients with renal impairment) and is inconsistent with clinical guidelines. However, the Subcommittee considered it possible that in some cases, some use of bisphosphonates may occur in practice with modified dosing schedules (eg once a month instead of once weekly treatment) for patients with few suitable options, such as those with significant renal impairment or those where benefits would outweigh risks, such as those with a high risk of fracture. Members considered that this would likely occur as a result of no effective funded alternatives.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that other funded treatments for osteoporosis include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, such as intravenous zoledronic acid.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Intolerance or contraindication to bisphosphonates</p><p>1.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that while some patients may experience minor adverse effects after infusion of bisphosphonates, there was an unmet need for patients who truly cannot tolerate first-line treatment with bisphosphonates eg patients very unwell and requiring hospitalisation, or those experiencing gastrointestinal issues with oral bisphosphonates (which the Subcommittee considered may occur in up to one in five people). The Subcommittee considered that there was a need for an effective alternative agent for reducing fracture risk, as an alternative to first-line bisphosphonates.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients may be considered to be intolerant to oral bisphosphonates due to malabsorption issues, oesophageal dysphagia or extensive gastrointestinal surgery, and that malabsorption may impair treatment efficacy.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that patients could be considered to be intolerant to bisphosphonates for other reasons, such as inflammatory eye disease (rare, but occurring in approximately 6 per 1,000 people) or acute phase reaction (occurring in up to 1 in 5 people, with very severe acute phase reactions in 1 in 200 people); these would preclude patients from safely receiving further treatment with bisphosphonates. Members considered that for the purposes of targeting funded treatment with denosumab, intolerance to bisphosphonates should be carefully defined.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people with renal failure (defined as having eGFR &lt;35 ml/min) comprise a significant proportion of patients within the group of patients for whom bisphosphonates are considered to be contraindicated, as bisphosphonates are renally excreted whereas denosumab is not renally excreted. The Subcommittee noted that clinical trials of bisphosphonates excluded people with eGFR of 35 or less, however, trials with denosumab did not exclude people with eGFR of 35 or less. The Subcommittee noted that, based on the evidence for denosumab in this patient subgroup, denosumab is considered to be safe in patients with renal failure. The Subcommittee considered that it was important to retain a criterion in the denosumab Special Authority for renal function and considered that eGFR was a more relevant measure than creatinine clearance.</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted in a US study that, among patients with osteoporosis, 23.8% had renal impairment of eGFR &lt;35 ml/min (Klawansky et al.

The Subcommittee considered the likely prevalence in New Zealand to be lower than this.</p><p><br></p><p>Administration</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that people who were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to, oral bisphosphonates (eg due to gastrointestinal malabsorption) could reasonably seek access to intravenous bisphosphonates, if available and accessible. However, the Subcommittee considered that there are access inequities resulting from lack of access to funded infusion services and inability to afford unfunded infusion services at a cost of up to $200 per patient per infusion.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that despite the cost of a pharmaceutical (such as zoledronic acid) being funded, administration costs may be incurred by patients as not all treatment centres fund intravenous infusions and access to unfunded infusion services is variable around the country. The Subcommittee considered that the intravenous administration fee paid by patients, required in some areas in order to receive funded intravenous treatment in the community presents a barrier to access for many patients. The Subcommittee considered that amending funding criteria would support equitable access to an effective treatment option for patients who cannot access infusion services to receive intravenous treatment.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that almost all people who would receive denosumab would self-administer as it is a subcutaneous injection, however, some patients may have this administered by a district nurse or receive injections in a rest home. The Subcommittee considered that self-administered subcutaneous injections would be manageable for the majority of eligible patients (or, where applicable, their caregivers), however the six-monthly administration may be challenging and result in patients taking longer to learn to self-administer as the long interval between injections would reduce familiarity with the technique.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1.13.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered, on balance, that six-monthly subcutaneous administration of denosumab would be straightforward for most patients and would be more accessible and provide suitability benefits over intravenous treatments.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Evidence</p><p><br></p><p>1.14.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that the key phase III trials of denosumab in osteoporosis were published more than a decade ago and considered that there would be no further trials, and in particular, no head-to-head trials investigating denosumab compared with other bisphosphonates. The Subcommittee considered that there is no new data available that has not already been reviewed by the Subcommittee or PTAC and noted the denosumab clinical trial data described in the Medsafe data sheet (Prolia Data Sheet, November 2020). The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of denosumab in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures is similar to that of other funded bisphosphonates and that it was appropriate for use as a second-line agent in most cases.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1.15.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that the evidence of health benefit in men and postmenopausal women can be extrapolated to pre-menopausal women, as in all situations including baseline risk, denosumab produces the same relative risk reduction in fractures. The Subcommittee considered that very few pre-menopausal female patients would seek access to denosumab for osteoporosis, therefore amending the criteria to omit gender and postmenopausal criteria would be reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>1.16.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to assume denosumab has similar anti-fracture efficacy to bisphosphonates, as the available evidence indicates that the relative risk reduction and anti-fracture efficacy is similar. The Subcommittee considered that the duration of effect after treatment with bisphosphonates differs depending on the chemical, although the evidence for this is limited.</p><p><br></p><p>1.17.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that denosumab is effective in reducing fracture risk in patients who cannot receive first-line treatment with bisphosphonates, and was made aware of evidence that indicates denosumab could be safely used in people with renal impairment (Nitta et al. Intern Med 2017;56:3271-76; Khairallah et al. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2018;13:962-9).</p><p><br></p><p>1.18.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that denosumab could be suitable for young children with bone fragility or osteogenesis imperfecta in their first few weeks of life, and for older children with cerebral palsy or previous fractures currently receiving zoledronic acid, where there are logistical or technical barriers to intravenous infusion services. The Subcommittee considered the majority of children would not be eligible under the proposed Special Authority criteria (given different definitions, the diagnostic requirements and differences in disease scoring in the paediatric setting, particularly for neonates), and that this should be discussed at a future meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>DEXA and fractures</p><p><br></p><p>1.19.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of hip fractures increases with age. The Subcommittee considered that the FRAX algorithm (to estimate all hip fracture probabilities) and the Garvan algorithm (for estimating the probability of all osteoporotic fractures) are essentially the same at a population level.</p><p><br></p><p>1.20.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee noted access to DEXA scanning would vary around the country. The Subcommittee considered that patients younger than 75 years of age who cannot access DEXA may meet the denosumab funding criteria based on the threshold for fracture risk instead.</p><p><br></p><p>1.21.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to retain the Special Authority criterion regarding fractures occurring while on bisphosphonates, as bone loss occurring while on bisphosphonates would indicate that further treatment should be considered. The Subcommittee did not consider it appropriate to switch treatment based on one fracture.</p><p><br></p><p>1.22.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria should be amended for clarity, to present the criteria for the targeted population more simply. The Subcommittee considered that severe osteoporosis was not a clinically recognised term and should be removed from the criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the definition of an osteoporotic fracture would be variable in practice, although fractures in the smaller bones of the hands, feet and skull would not be considered fragility fractures.</p><p><br></p><p>Costs and savings</p><p><br></p><p>1.23.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that the costs of not effectively treating patients at risk of fractures was significant due to the high cost of hospital admission and extended stay in hospital to manage a hip fracture for example, in addition to transfer to a rest home which may be required for many older patients. Members considered that these costs were significant and far-reaching, with impacts on the health system. Despite the drug cost of denosumab being considerably higher than that of bisphosphonates, the Subcommittee considered that there would be a reduction in other costs due to prevention of fractures in patients who could not receive bisphosphonates as first-line treatment for osteoporosis.</p><p><br></p><p>Special Authority amendments</p><p><br></p><p>1.24.\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered the following amendments would need to be made to the current Special Authority criteria for denosumab to widen funded treatment to those for whom bisphosphonates are contraindicated:</p><p><br></p><p>DENOSUMAB</p><p><br></p><p>Initial application – from any relevant practitioner.
