The Subcommittee also noted the reasons PTAC had given for its recommendation were that although PTAC had considered the ENDEAVOR trial data provided good quality evidence and showed PFS and OS improvement in the carfilzomib group, PTAC had considered the potential benefit of carfilzomib to New Zealand patients unclear; and PTAC had considered that although any funded carfilzomib would add another option into the sequence of therapies for MM, given its current dosing schedule it would significantly impact DHB infusion services and could potentially increase inequities in access. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee also noted that in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">February 2019</a> PTAC has also commented with carfilzomib that there were a large number of currently unfunded new treatments for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma being researched that have uncertain effectiveness and very high cost, especially when used in combination; and that PTAC had supported CaTSoP’s view that wider consultation with relevant clinicians on a preferred national treatment algorithm should be undertaken to better understand the clinical priorities for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the NCCN (version 3.2018) and ESMO (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28453614"" target=""_blank"">Moreau et al.

Lancet Oncol. 2017;18:1327-37</a>) included 929 patients with 1-3 prior lines treatment, reporting a median overall survival (OS) of 47.6 months in the carfilzomib group compared with 40.0 months in the bortezomib group (HR 0.791; 95% CI 0.648 to 0.964) after a median follow-up of 37.5 months in the carfilzomib group and 36.9 months in the bortezomib group. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the comparator used in the ENDEAVOR study was twice weekly bortezomib, which is likely to cause more neuropathy and have no additional benefit than weekly bortezomib, which is the standard of care in New Zealand. It is therefore likely to overestimate the benefit of carfilzomib in reducing neuropathy in a New Zealand population. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee also considered treated patients in New Zealand would be older than the median age of 65 years in the study, and nearly all patients would be previously treated with bortezomib and some would have received thalidomide. The Subcommittee considered that the bortezomib comparator was likely superior to the thalidomide-based regimens currently used in New Zealand in second line, but if widened access to bortezomib retreatment was progressed, then this would be an appropriate comparator. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that limiting the eligible population to those patients currently eligible for lenalidomide in second line who have experienced severe (grade 3 or higher), dose limiting, peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib precluding further treatment would be an option to limit the budget and infusion impacts overall, although it is uncertain if it would be used in preference to oral lenalidomide. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the subgroup analysis of those in ENDEAVOR with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min appearing to show less PFS benefit. The Subcommittee considered that the confidence interval was very large, and that renal impairment can be disease related and improve on treatment. The Subcommittee noted another analysis of the data (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478094"" target=""_blank"">Dimopoulos et al. Blood. 2019;133:147-155</a>).

The Subcommittee considered the average duration on treatment if funded would likely be close to the 48 weeks of the trial. This difference between treatment duration and PFS was likely due to the high rates of discontinuation due to adverse events and patients choosing to stop, likely due to the high infusion burden, but ongoing disease response despite discontinuation. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee agreed with PTAC that carfilzomib would add another option into the sequence of therapies rather than displacing or replacing other agents. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, in the absence of bortezomib retreatment, most patients that received bortezomib in first line would go on to receive carfilzomib in the second line setting if funded, except those who had contraindications such as congestive heart failure. If bortezomib retreatment was a funded treatment option, the number of patients who would seek treatment with carfilzomib may be lower as some patients may instead receive bortezomib. The Subcommittee noted that although carfilzomib caused less neuropathy, cardiovascular toxicity remained a concern and additional clinical monitoring may be required with a possible requirement for cardiac echocardiograms in some patients. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in the ENDEAVOR trial that carfilzomib was given at a dose of 56 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice weekly x 3 each 28 day cycle, whereas in the ARROW trial (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29866475"" target=""_blank"">Moreau et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:953-964</a>) a dose of 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly x 3 each 28 day cycle was used.

The Subcommittee considered the ENDEAVOR trial more accurately represented the population proposed for funding in New Zealand. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the cross-study comparison provided by the supplier, with included an adjustment using propensity score matching. This statistical adjustment for co-variates transformed the median PFS in ARROW from appearing inferior compared with ENDEAVOR to appearing superior. The Subcommittee considered the difference in relative effects sizes to be large and implausible and reflecting likely the large differences between the respective study populations, and that propensity analysis in this setting was thus of poor validity and the adjustment to be inadequately justified to give confidence that the health benefits gained from carfilzomib 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly would be comparable to carfilzomib 56 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice weekly. The Subcommittee therefore considered that while funded 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly could be left as an option for clinicians, it could not be recommended as a mandated approach to limit the dose via Special Authority criteria if the expected benefits were derived from the outcomes in ENDEAVOR. The Subcommittee considered the uptake of any 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly dosing option would be low, given this uncertainty of benefit. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on its limited review of the evidence from ENDEAVOR, there was good quality evidence of improved PFS and OS in a large cohort over a comparator that is likely superior to current treatment in New Zealand. In the context of this and the limited alternative treatment options available in New Zealand, the Subcommittee supported a medium priority recommendation for funding carfilzomib as a second-line treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.</p>', 'fs': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that multiple myeloma is treated with sequential lines of therapy and may include autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), which can be incorporated into the initial therapeutic regimen or at relapse, depending on patient eligibility.

The Subcommittee considered the uptake of any 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once weekly dosing option would be low, given this uncertainty of benefit. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on its limited review of the evidence from ENDEAVOR, there was good quality evidence of improved PFS and OS in a large cohort over a comparator that is likely superior to current treatment in New Zealand.

<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
