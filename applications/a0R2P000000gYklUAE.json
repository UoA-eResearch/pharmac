          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that nPEP is recommended, based on risk of transmissible exposure, to be commenced within 72 hours and is typically a two or three drug regimen that is continued for 28 days. Members noted that two drug regimens include emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir disoproxil with lamivudine; three drug regimens include dolutegravir, raltegravir or rilpivirine in addition to the two drug regimen.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the current nPEP criteria is not in-line with the latest evidence of transmission of HIV noting that most transmission is driven by people that are unaware that they have HIV. (Saxton et al, 2015A. HIV prevention todayNZMJ; 128(1426): 8-15) The Subcommittee noted that when the criteria were developed they were based on limiting the patient group to a risk greater than 1 in 300 and this took into account a high drug cost and was based on the current percutaneous occupational risk. Members noted that PHARMAC has recently competed the antiretroviral market which included significant price reductions for emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current treatment paradigm now considers that HIV positive patients who are on treatment and have an undetectable viral load for six months cannot transmit the virus, so treating patients only with known HIV status is no longer relevant.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the it would be highly unlikely for there to be a definitive placebo-controlled trial conducted in the setting of nPEP and current treatment recommendations are based on risk of transmission calculated from known case reports, mother-to-child transmission studies and occupational exposure data. The Subcommittee noted that current international practice (such as the Australasian Society for HIV (ASHM)) is to calculate risk of the patient being infected by multiplying the exposure type by the likelihood that the source has transmissible HIV. Members noted ASHM had performed a significant review of the literature in 2016 which was published on its website: https://www.ashm.org.au/HIV/PEP/PEP_Literature_Review_2016.PDF</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that treatment recommendations for jurisdictions outside of New Zealand varies and many use a risk greater than 1 in 1000 as a basis of recommending\u00a0treatment. Members noted that, in Australia for example, the funding of nPEP is not via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as the cost of the medicine is funded by State and territory Departments of Health. The treating clinician will consider the ASHM guidelines and consider the benefits of treatment compared with the risk of harm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the landscape has changed: that HIV medication is much more well-tolerated and affordable and that it is reasonable to consider a risk of 1:1000, rather than 1:300, In line with international literature reviews and guidelines. Members considered that an acceptable risk to treat in New Zealand was 1 in 1000 which included in HIV positive or unknown viral load partners who had receptive and insertive anal sex or receptive vaginal sex, but this did not include insertive vaginal sex. For a partner with unknown HIV status, this included receptive anal sex only.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the current prescriber restrictions for nPEP and considered that access to treatment can be inequitable when there is poor access to a named antiretroviral specialists. Members considered that in Queenstown, for example, the nearest hospital is 4 hour drive away and there are no named antiretroviral specialists. Members also noted that the current criteria has components open to interpretation and\u00a0considered it is timely for this Subcommittee to review the criteria given that PrEP has been funded since January 2018.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that since funding PrEP it has become quite evident that the nPEP and PrEP prescriber access to antiretrovirals should be widened. There needs to be better access for prescribers who treat vulnerable patients in the community and the same barriers to access (for HIV chronic treatment for example) need not be in place. The Subcommittee also considered that similar prescribers should be able to provide both nPEP and PrEP and that it is important (for PrEP) that prescribers acknowledge that they have sought training to be competent in the risks and benefits of these treatments in these patients groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee recommended changes to the nPEP Special Authority criteria to widen the prescriber access and allow treatment for patients where there is a risk of 1 in 1000 or greater (additions in bold, deletions in strikethrough):</p><p>Initial application \u2014 (post-exposure prophylaxis following non-occupational exposure to HIV) only from a named specialist sexual health specialist, infectious disease specialist, vocationally registered general practitioner or nurse practitioner.

The Subcommittee considered that some hospitals already provide emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil as a starter pack dispensed by their hospital pharmacy. Members noted that for emergency use, in a community setting, a practitioners supply order, would normally be used as a mechanism however this is not possible with a pharmaceutical that has a restriction.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee recommended changes to the PrEP Special Authority criteria to widen the prescriber access to initiations and also cover the testing and considerations required for community initiations of this treatment (additions in bold, deletions in strikethrough):</p><p>Initial application only from a named specialist or medical practitioner on the recommendation of a named specialist sexual health specialist, infectious disease specialist, vocationally registered general practitioner or nurse practitioner.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that nPEP is recommended, based on risk of transmissible exposure, to be commenced within 72 hours and is typically a two or three drug regimen that is continued for 28 days. Members noted that two drug regimens include emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir disoproxil with lamivudine; three drug regimens include dolutegravir, raltegravir or rilpivirine in addition to the two drug regimen.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the current nPEP criteria is not in-line with the latest evidence of transmission of HIV noting that most transmission is driven by people that are unaware that they have HIV. (Saxton et al, 2015A. HIV prevention todayNZMJ; 128(1426): 8-15) The Subcommittee noted that when the criteria were developed they were based on limiting the patient group to a risk greater than 1 in 300 and this took into account a high drug cost and was based on the current percutaneous occupational risk. Members noted that PHARMAC has recently competed the antiretroviral market which included significant price reductions for emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current treatment paradigm now considers that HIV positive patients who are on treatment and have an undetectable viral load for six months cannot transmit the virus, so treating patients only with known HIV status is no longer relevant.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered the it would be highly unlikely for there to be a definitive placebo-controlled trial conducted in the setting of nPEP and current treatment recommendations are based on risk of transmission calculated from known case reports, mother-to-child transmission studies and occupational exposure data. The Subcommittee noted that current international practice (such as the Australasian Society for HIV (ASHM)) is to calculate risk of the patient being infected by multiplying the exposure type by the likelihood that the source has transmissible HIV. Members noted ASHM had performed a significant review of the literature in 2016 which was published on its website: https://www.ashm.org.au/HIV/PEP/PEP_Literature_Review_2016.PDF</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that treatment recommendations for jurisdictions outside of New Zealand varies and many use a risk greater than 1 in 1000 as a basis of recommending\u00a0treatment. Members noted that, in Australia for example, the funding of nPEP is not via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as the cost of the medicine is funded by State and territory Departments of Health. The treating clinician will consider the ASHM guidelines and consider the benefits of treatment compared with the risk of harm.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the landscape has changed: that HIV medication is much more well-tolerated and affordable and that it is reasonable to consider a risk of 1:1000, rather than 1:300, In line with international literature reviews and guidelines. Members considered that an acceptable risk to treat in New Zealand was 1 in 1000 which included in HIV positive or unknown viral load partners who had receptive and insertive anal sex or receptive vaginal sex, but this did not include insertive vaginal sex. For a partner with unknown HIV status, this included receptive anal sex only.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the current prescriber restrictions for nPEP and considered that access to treatment can be inequitable when there is poor access to a named antiretroviral specialists. Members considered that in Queenstown, for example, the nearest hospital is 4 hour drive away and there are no named antiretroviral specialists. Members also noted that the current criteria has components open to interpretation and\u00a0considered it is timely for this Subcommittee to review the criteria given that PrEP has been funded since January 2018.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that since funding PrEP it has become quite evident that the nPEP and PrEP prescriber access to antiretrovirals should be widened. There needs to be better access for prescribers who treat vulnerable patients in the community and the same barriers to access (for HIV chronic treatment for example) need not be in place. The Subcommittee also considered that similar prescribers should be able to provide both nPEP and PrEP and that it is important (for PrEP) that prescribers acknowledge that they have sought training to be competent in the risks and benefits of these treatments in these patients groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee recommended changes to the nPEP Special Authority criteria to widen the prescriber access and allow treatment for patients where there is a risk of 1 in 1000 or greater (additions in bold, deletions in strikethrough):</p><p>Initial application \u2014 (post-exposure prophylaxis following non-occupational exposure to HIV) only from a named specialist sexual health specialist, infectious disease specialist, vocationally registered general practitioner or nurse practitioner.
