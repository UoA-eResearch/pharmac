Members noted that certolizumab pegol was used right through to 38 weeks as the only risk related to maternal infection at birth and considered that perhaps eight or nine 200 mg doses would be used over the course of pregnancy if certolizumab pegol were to be used from 20 weeks in place of one of the three funded TNFi.

Members also considered that it was common to extend the dosing interval of anti-TNFs during pregnancy and discontinue treatment after approximately 24 weeks. Members considered that in pregnancy, the management of an individual’s RA would be guided by their rheumatologist, while those who are pregnant and living with highly complex RA (eg those with limited hip movement or other complexities) would also be cared for by an obstetrician. Members considered that the key risk of RA treatment with certolizumab pegol during pregnancy was a six-month risk of infection for the baby, which would impact the infant’s ability to receive any live vaccines until at least five months after last dose during pregnancy. Members further considered that funding certolizumab pegol as an additional treatment option for RA in pregnancy could add unnecessary complexity during pregnancy from treatment switching. </p><h2><strong>General</strong></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that it was unclear whether there was a need for certolizumab for the treatment of RA and where this might fit into the treatment paradigm.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
</ul>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
