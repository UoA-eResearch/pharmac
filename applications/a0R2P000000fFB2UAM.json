The Subcommittees noted that SMA is categorised into \u2018types\u2019 based on age of onset and maximal motor function achieved.</p><p>The Subcommittees noted that this funding application was in relation to types 1, 2 and 3 only, which includes patients with symptomatic disease diagnosed from birth to the age of 18 years.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the severity of disease varies depending on Type of SMA, with symptoms varying from inability to sit or roll (Type 1) to the potential loss of ability to walk over time (Type 3). The Subcommittees noted that the average life expectancy of those with Type 1 SMA is less than two years, while individuals with Type 3 are expected to have an unaffected lifespan.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that PHARMAC has not previously received a funding application for people with SMA Types 3b and 3c. The Subcommittees noted that people with SMA Type 3b are diagnosed age &gt;3 years, while those with Type 3c are diagnosed between &gt;12 to \u226418 years. The Subcommittee also noted that PHARMAC had not previously received a funding application for treatment for patients with SMA over the age of 18 years.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the high health need of family, wh\u0101nau and caregivers of people with SMA. The Subcommittees noted that a small number of families have left New Zealand to seek funded SMA treatment for their children; the Subcommittees acknowledged the significance of this and the enormous impact that this disease has on both the patient and their wh\u0101nau.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there are currently no funded disease modifying treatments for SMA. The Subcommittees noted that supportive care for individuals with SMA includes non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physiotherapy and nutritional support to assist with respiratory, mobility or feeding difficulties. The Subcommittees noted that PHARMAC has previously received and assessed a funding application for nusinersen for pre-symptomatic, Type 1, 2 and 3a SMA. The Subcommittees noted that nusinersen remains an option for investment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC has not received any other funding applications for the treatment of SMA, however that other agents such as gene replacement therapy are on the horizon.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted<i> </i>that SMA (Types 1, 2 and 3a) had previously been considered to meet<i> </i>PHARMAC\u2019s <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\">Rare Disorder Principles</a>. The Subcommittees considered that the application for risdiplam for SMA, Types 1-3 does meet these principles; however, members noted that there are variable reports of SMA incidence and as such it was not unanimously agreed that this application met Principle Two.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam modulates SMN2 gene splicing, binding two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA, allowing full length SMN mRNA and protein to be synthesised; with systemic distribution demonstrated in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs in vivo. The Subcommittees queried the half-life of risdiplam, noting that such pharmacokinetic aspects could have appreciable effects on dosing frequency, and noted that they would like to review the relevant data.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of FIREFISH (part II), a phase II, open label study of 41 SMA Type 1 patients treated with risdiplam once daily (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/d325540c-a8a6-4c65-bc7d-05eb76d87eba\" target=\"_blank\">Servais et al. 73rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. Canada. 2020</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients were aged one to seven months old (inclusive) at enrolment and had confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA, with two SMN2 gene copies.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted at 12 months that 29% of patients had met the primary outcome, sitting without support for at least five seconds. The Subcommittee also noted at 12 months, 93% of infants were alive, 85% of infants were event free, and 95% of infants alive maintained the ability to swallow.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that, while relatively short, a 12-month follow up for the SMA Type 1 population was a highly relevant timeframe, noting that Type 1 patients are severely impacted by SMA and sadly often die within this timeframe. The Subcommittee noted that historical controls (also with two SMN2 copies) have a reported median age of event-free survival of 10.5 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155049/\" target=\"_blank\">Finkel et al. Neurol. 2014;83:810-7</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the survival benefit of risdiplam demonstrated at 12 months in the FIREFISH study was highly clinically meaningful.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that 49% of all infants in the FIREFISH study did not require hospitalisation in the 12-month study period. The Subcommittees considered that while this appeared to be a positive finding, it was unclear at this stage whether treatment with risdiplam would have a sustained response in reducing the need for hospitalisation, or whether it would only delay this need.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam was reasonably well tolerated, with the most common adverse event of pneumonia. The Subcommittees noted that there were three reported fatal events in the trial (7%) secondary to SMA-related respiratory complications.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that risdiplam has a similar mechanism of action to nusinersen, which has demonstrated<span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"> </span>sustained effect in people with Type 1 SMA over longer follow up. The Subcommittee therefore considered that overall, despite the short-term follow-up, the evidence for risdiplam in Type 1 SMA was of moderate strength with a large, clinically meaningful effect. The Subcommittee noted that due to the small number of patients and availability of other SMA treatments, it was unlikely that better quality evidence (ie. a sufficiently-powered placebo-controlled randomised control trial) would become available.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was currently no available direct comparison of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. SMA Europe. France. 2020</a> (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02908685\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02908685</a>)). Participants had a mean age of onset of 15.5 months, were aged two to 25 years at time of treatment, were able to sit independently and had some upper limb mobility and strength.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH trial included a broad population, noting that there were no exclusion criteria related to the degree of scoliosis, contractures, feeding support or non-invasive ventilation.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a least squares mean change from baseline to 12 months of 1.5 in Motor Function Measure, MFM32, in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo (95% confidence interval: 0.3-2.81, P=0.0156). The Subcommittees also noted a greater proportion treated with risdiplam had an improvement of at least three points in MFM32 total score compared with placebo (38% vs 24% respectively; odds ratio=2.35).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there was a small improvement in the mean change in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo, shown by a least squares mean change from baseline of 1.61 vs 0.02 (odds ratio=1.59; P=0.0028).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there were no statistically significant least square mean changes from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) or SMA independence measures observed between risdiplam and placebo (adjusted, P=0.3902 and P=0.3902 respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the minimal clinically important difference values for functional motor scores commonly used in adults with SMA are approximately two for both the RULM and the HFMSE (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14472\" target=\"_blank\">Stolte et al.

The Subcommittee noted that historical controls (also with two SMN2 copies) have a reported median age of event-free survival of 10.5 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155049/\" target=\"_blank\">Finkel et al.

The Subcommittee therefore considered that overall, despite the short-term follow-up, the evidence for risdiplam in Type 1 SMA was of moderate strength with a large, clinically meaningful effect.

The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al.

The Subcommittees noted that SMA is categorised into \u2018types\u2019 based on age of onset and maximal motor function achieved.</p><p>The Subcommittees noted that this funding application was in relation to types 1, 2 and 3 only, which includes patients with symptomatic disease diagnosed from birth to the age of 18 years.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the severity of disease varies depending on Type of SMA, with symptoms varying from inability to sit or roll (Type 1) to the potential loss of ability to walk over time (Type 3). The Subcommittees noted that the average life expectancy of those with Type 1 SMA is less than two years, while individuals with Type 3 are expected to have an unaffected lifespan.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that PHARMAC has not previously received a funding application for people with SMA Types 3b and 3c. The Subcommittees noted that people with SMA Type 3b are diagnosed age &gt;3 years, while those with Type 3c are diagnosed between &gt;12 to \u226418 years. The Subcommittee also noted that PHARMAC had not previously received a funding application for treatment for patients with SMA over the age of 18 years.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the high health need of family, wh\u0101nau and caregivers of people with SMA. The Subcommittees noted that a small number of families have left New Zealand to seek funded SMA treatment for their children; the Subcommittees acknowledged the significance of this and the enormous impact that this disease has on both the patient and their wh\u0101nau.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there are currently no funded disease modifying treatments for SMA. The Subcommittees noted that supportive care for individuals with SMA includes non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physiotherapy and nutritional support to assist with respiratory, mobility or feeding difficulties. The Subcommittees noted that PHARMAC has previously received and assessed a funding application for nusinersen for pre-symptomatic, Type 1, 2 and 3a SMA. The Subcommittees noted that nusinersen remains an option for investment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC has not received any other funding applications for the treatment of SMA, however that other agents such as gene replacement therapy are on the horizon.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted<i> </i>that SMA (Types 1, 2 and 3a) had previously been considered to meet<i> </i>PHARMAC\u2019s <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\">Rare Disorder Principles</a>. The Subcommittees considered that the application for risdiplam for SMA, Types 1-3 does meet these principles; however, members noted that there are variable reports of SMA incidence and as such it was not unanimously agreed that this application met Principle Two.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam modulates SMN2 gene splicing, binding two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA, allowing full length SMN mRNA and protein to be synthesised; with systemic distribution demonstrated in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs in vivo. The Subcommittees queried the half-life of risdiplam, noting that such pharmacokinetic aspects could have appreciable effects on dosing frequency, and noted that they would like to review the relevant data.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of FIREFISH (part II), a phase II, open label study of 41 SMA Type 1 patients treated with risdiplam once daily (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/d325540c-a8a6-4c65-bc7d-05eb76d87eba\" target=\"_blank\">Servais et al. 73rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. Canada. 2020</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients were aged one to seven months old (inclusive) at enrolment and had confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA, with two SMN2 gene copies.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted at 12 months that 29% of patients had met the primary outcome, sitting without support for at least five seconds. The Subcommittee also noted at 12 months, 93% of infants were alive, 85% of infants were event free, and 95% of infants alive maintained the ability to swallow.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that, while relatively short, a 12-month follow up for the SMA Type 1 population was a highly relevant timeframe, noting that Type 1 patients are severely impacted by SMA and sadly often die within this timeframe. The Subcommittee noted that historical controls (also with two SMN2 copies) have a reported median age of event-free survival of 10.5 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155049/\" target=\"_blank\">Finkel et al. Neurol. 2014;83:810-7</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the survival benefit of risdiplam demonstrated at 12 months in the FIREFISH study was highly clinically meaningful.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that 49% of all infants in the FIREFISH study did not require hospitalisation in the 12-month study period. The Subcommittees considered that while this appeared to be a positive finding, it was unclear at this stage whether treatment with risdiplam would have a sustained response in reducing the need for hospitalisation, or whether it would only delay this need.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam was reasonably well tolerated, with the most common adverse event of pneumonia. The Subcommittees noted that there were three reported fatal events in the trial (7%) secondary to SMA-related respiratory complications.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that risdiplam has a similar mechanism of action to nusinersen, which has demonstrated<span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"> </span>sustained effect in people with Type 1 SMA over longer follow up. The Subcommittee therefore considered that overall, despite the short-term follow-up, the evidence for risdiplam in Type 1 SMA was of moderate strength with a large, clinically meaningful effect. The Subcommittee noted that due to the small number of patients and availability of other SMA treatments, it was unlikely that better quality evidence (ie. a sufficiently-powered placebo-controlled randomised control trial) would become available.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was currently no available direct comparison of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. SMA Europe. France. 2020</a> (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02908685\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02908685</a>)). Participants had a mean age of onset of 15.5 months, were aged two to 25 years at time of treatment, were able to sit independently and had some upper limb mobility and strength.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH trial included a broad population, noting that there were no exclusion criteria related to the degree of scoliosis, contractures, feeding support or non-invasive ventilation.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a least squares mean change from baseline to 12 months of 1.5 in Motor Function Measure, MFM32, in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo (95% confidence interval: 0.3-2.81, P=0.0156). The Subcommittees also noted a greater proportion treated with risdiplam had an improvement of at least three points in MFM32 total score compared with placebo (38% vs 24% respectively; odds ratio=2.35).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there was a small improvement in the mean change in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo, shown by a least squares mean change from baseline of 1.61 vs 0.02 (odds ratio=1.59; P=0.0028).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there were no statistically significant least square mean changes from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) or SMA independence measures observed between risdiplam and placebo (adjusted, P=0.3902 and P=0.3902 respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the minimal clinically important difference values for functional motor scores commonly used in adults with SMA are approximately two for both the RULM and the HFMSE (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14472\" target=\"_blank\">Stolte et al. Euro J Neurol. 2020;27:2586\u201394</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the qualitative results McGraw et al. 2017, which reported that patients and caregivers highly value even small improvements and that meaningful change is relative to the functional ability already achieved (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381033/\" target=\"_blank\">McGraw et al. BMC Neurol. 2017;17:68</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that pneumonia was the most common significant adverse event (7.5% risdiplam compared with 1.7% placebo), while no fatal events were reported.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH trial was of moderate strength of small effect and considered that longer-term follow up data would need to be evaluated.</p><p>1.23.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees considered there was some uncertainty of the long-term, ongoing benefit of risdiplam, particularly in the treatment of Type 2 and 3 SMA, due to limited follow up, noting that SMA is a lifelong condition and to date only one year of follow-up data is available, but also observing that 12 months was a substantial time in the context of low survival as seen in SMA overall.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that as the two primary studies, FIREFISH and SUNFISH, were in two different SMA populations, it considered it appropriate to consider the health benefits of risdiplam in these two different groups separately.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that using 12-month data of patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA treated with nusinersen had an approximate 3.5 point increase RULM compared with 1.5 points with risdiplam (noting that the risdiplam trial had wider group of Type 3 subtypes). The Subcommittees considered that this may, in part, be explained by the differences in patient cohorts, ie. In SUNFISH the average age was nine years at study entry vs in the CHERISH study (for nusinersen) with an average age of four and exclusion of patients with scoliosis (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710504\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:625- 35</a>); noting the marked difference in response according to age at starting treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that neither the FIREFISH nor SUNFISH results had been published formally and fully at the time of assessment, and as such had not yet undergone rigorous peer-review (especially of methods and statistical methods).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that those who would benefit most from treatment with risdiplam were individuals who would be treated early and/or with more severe disease. The Subcommittees considered that there was a high health need among patients with SMA Type 0 with the potential for these patients to benefit from SMA treatment the most, however noted that this indication was not included in this funding application. The Subcommittees noted that there was an ongoing study of risdiplam for pre-symptomatic SMA, and that they would welcome a funding application for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam is administered orally. The Subcommittees considered this to be a very suitable formulation and that it would empower family/ wh\u0101nau to deliver the medicine at home. Members noted that in comparison to other formulations for other SMA treatments (eg. intrathecal injection), an oral formulation may be more suitable. Members were made aware of anecdotal clinical experience of a possible lack of cultural acceptance of lumbar puncture in Tongan people. The Subcommittees also noted that the oral formulation would be equitably favourable for patients and family/ wh\u0101nau living in deprived or rural areas.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that there may be a risk of wastage of risdiplam, for example when bottles were taken home. Members considered that this may need to be factored into the cost of this proposal.<i> </i></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam has not yet been recommended for funding in Australia, Canada, Scotland, or England/Wales.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the appropriate comparator for patients with Type 1, 2 and 3 SMA is best supportive care. The Subcommittees considered that motor function, bulbar function, hospitalisation, respiratory function, complications of SMA, ventilation, stamina and fatigue, mortality, and adverse effects of treatment were appropriate outcomes. The Subcommittees considered that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was not an appropriate outcome yet, as there was currently no available data in relation to risdiplam and because HRQoL is difficult to estimate in infants; the Subcommittees noted it would welcome any such data in further assessment of this application.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the supplier patient number estimates seemed reasonable. However, the Subcommittee considered that there may be some uncertainty regarding how accurately patients over the age of 18 could be identified. The Subcommittee noted the patient numbers for Type 1, 2 and 3a provided to PHARMAC by Starship Hospital staff in 2020 and considered that these figures were accurate. Members noted that recent reviews have reported an incidence of SMA up to 1 in 11,000 (<a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. Orphan J Rare Disord. 2017;12</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that new-born screening for SMA is currently under consideration among some health care providers; the Subcommittee considered that the impact of screening on patient numbers is uncertain.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the Supplier has assumed in its modelling that Type 2 and 3 patients convert to full health following risdiplam treatment. Members considered that a conversion to full health was not supported by currently available data.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that, compared with regular intrathecal injection treatment for SMA, oral risdiplam has the potential to reduce health system costs to a greater extent, if the same or similar efficacy was achieved relative to other treatment.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that historical controls (also with two SMN2 copies) have a reported median age of event-free survival of 10.5 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155049/\" target=\"_blank\">Finkel et al.

The Subcommittees considered that while this appeared to be a positive finding, it was unclear at this stage whether treatment with risdiplam would have a sustained response in reducing the need for hospitalisation, or whether it would only delay this need.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam was reasonably well tolerated, with the most common adverse event of pneumonia.

The Subcommittee therefore considered that overall, despite the short-term follow-up, the evidence for risdiplam in Type 1 SMA was of moderate strength with a large, clinically meaningful effect. The Subcommittee noted that due to the small number of patients and availability of other SMA treatments, it was unlikely that better quality evidence (ie. a sufficiently-powered placebo-controlled randomised control trial) would become available.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was currently no available direct comparison of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al.

Euro J Neurol. 2020;27:2586\u201394</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the qualitative results McGraw et al. 2017, which reported that patients and caregivers highly value even small improvements and that meaningful change is relative to the functional ability already achieved (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381033/\" target=\"_blank\">McGraw et al.

The Subcommittees considered that this may, in part, be explained by the differences in patient cohorts, ie. In SUNFISH the average age was nine years at study entry vs in the CHERISH study (for nusinersen) with an average age of four and exclusion of patients with scoliosis (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710504\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al.

The Subcommittees considered that there was a high health need among patients with SMA Type 0 with the potential for these patients to benefit from SMA treatment the most, however noted that this indication was not included in this funding application. The Subcommittees noted that there was an ongoing study of risdiplam for pre-symptomatic SMA, and that they would welcome a funding application for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam is administered orally. The Subcommittees considered this to be a very suitable formulation and that it would empower family/ wh\u0101nau to deliver the medicine at home. Members noted that in comparison to other formulations for other SMA treatments (eg. intrathecal injection), an oral formulation may be more suitable. Members were made aware of anecdotal clinical experience of a possible lack of cultural acceptance of lumbar puncture in Tongan people. The Subcommittees also noted that the oral formulation would be equitably favourable for patients and family/ wh\u0101nau living in deprived or rural areas.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that there may be a risk of wastage of risdiplam, for example when bottles were taken home.

The Subcommittees considered that motor function, bulbar function, hospitalisation, respiratory function, complications of SMA, ventilation, stamina and fatigue, mortality, and adverse effects of treatment were appropriate outcomes. The Subcommittees considered that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was not an appropriate outcome yet, as there was currently no available data in relation to risdiplam and because HRQoL is difficult to estimate in infants; the Subcommittees noted it would welcome any such data in further assessment of this application.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the supplier patient number estimates seemed reasonable. However, the Subcommittee considered that there may be some uncertainty regarding how accurately patients over the age of 18 could be identified. The Subcommittee noted the patient numbers for Type 1, 2 and 3a provided to PHARMAC by Starship Hospital staff in 2020 and considered that these figures were accurate. Members noted that recent reviews have reported an incidence of SMA up to 1 in 11,000 (<a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al.

The Subcommittee therefore considered that overall, despite the short-term follow-up, the evidence for risdiplam in Type 1 SMA was of moderate strength with a large, clinically meaningful effect. The Subcommittee noted that due to the small number of patients and availability of other SMA treatments, it was unlikely that better quality evidence (ie. a sufficiently-powered placebo-controlled randomised control trial) would become available.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was currently no available direct comparison of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al.

The Subcommittees also noted a greater proportion treated with risdiplam had an improvement of at least three points in MFM32 total score compared with placebo (38% vs 24% respectively; odds ratio=2.35).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there was a small improvement in the mean change in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo, shown by a least squares mean change from baseline of 1.61 vs 0.02 (odds ratio=1.59; P=0.0028).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there were no statistically significant least square mean changes from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) or SMA independence measures observed between risdiplam and placebo (adjusted, P=0.3902 and P=0.3902 respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the minimal clinically important difference values for functional motor scores commonly used in adults with SMA are approximately two for both the RULM and the HFMSE (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14472\" target=\"_blank\">Stolte et al. Euro J Neurol. 2020;27:2586\u201394</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the qualitative results McGraw et al. 2017, which reported that patients and caregivers highly value even small improvements and that meaningful change is relative to the functional ability already achieved (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381033/\" target=\"_blank\">McGraw et al.

The Subcommittees considered that this may, in part, be explained by the differences in patient cohorts, ie. In SUNFISH the average age was nine years at study entry vs in the CHERISH study (for nusinersen) with an average age of four and exclusion of patients with scoliosis (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710504\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al.

The Subcommittees considered that there was a high health need among patients with SMA Type 0 with the potential for these patients to benefit from SMA treatment the most, however noted that this indication was not included in this funding application. The Subcommittees noted that there was an ongoing study of risdiplam for pre-symptomatic SMA, and that they would welcome a funding application for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam is administered orally. The Subcommittees considered this to be a very suitable formulation and that it would empower family/ wh\u0101nau to deliver the medicine at home. Members noted that in comparison to other formulations for other SMA treatments (eg. intrathecal injection), an oral formulation may be more suitable. Members were made aware of anecdotal clinical experience of a possible lack of cultural acceptance of lumbar puncture in Tongan people. The Subcommittees also noted that the oral formulation would be equitably favourable for patients and family/ wh\u0101nau living in deprived or rural areas.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that there may be a risk of wastage of risdiplam, for example when bottles were taken home. Members considered that this may need to be factored into the cost of this proposal.<i> </i></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam has not yet been recommended for funding in Australia, Canada, Scotland, or England/Wales.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the appropriate comparator for patients with Type 1, 2 and 3 SMA is best supportive care. The Subcommittees considered that motor function, bulbar function, hospitalisation, respiratory function, complications of SMA, ventilation, stamina and fatigue, mortality, and adverse effects of treatment were appropriate outcomes. The Subcommittees considered that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was not an appropriate outcome yet, as there was currently no available data in relation to risdiplam and because HRQoL is difficult to estimate in infants; the Subcommittees noted it would welcome any such data in further assessment of this application.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the supplier patient number estimates seemed reasonable. However, the Subcommittee considered that there may be some uncertainty regarding how accurately patients over the age of 18 could be identified. The Subcommittee noted the patient numbers for Type 1, 2 and 3a provided to PHARMAC by Starship Hospital staff in 2020 and considered that these figures were accurate. Members noted that recent reviews have reported an incidence of SMA up to 1 in 11,000 (<a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al.

The Subcommittee noted that due to the small number of patients and availability of other SMA treatments, it was unlikely that better quality evidence (ie. a sufficiently-powered placebo-controlled randomised control trial) would become available.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was currently no available direct comparison of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittee noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, it considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar effect of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with Type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the results of the SUNFISH trial (part II), a phase II randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180 individuals with SMA Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 (<a href=\"https://ir.ptcbio.com/static-files/4425c89f-1648-4346-9769-2a29ad30b179\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. SMA Europe. France. 2020</a> (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02908685\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02908685</a>)). Participants had a mean age of onset of 15.5 months, were aged two to 25 years at time of treatment, were able to sit independently and had some upper limb mobility and strength.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH trial included a broad population, noting that there were no exclusion criteria related to the degree of scoliosis, contractures, feeding support or non-invasive ventilation.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a least squares mean change from baseline to 12 months of 1.5 in Motor Function Measure, MFM32, in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo (95% confidence interval: 0.3-2.81, P=0.0156). The Subcommittees also noted a greater proportion treated with risdiplam had an improvement of at least three points in MFM32 total score compared with placebo (38% vs 24% respectively; odds ratio=2.35).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there was a small improvement in the mean change in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scores in patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo, shown by a least squares mean change from baseline of 1.61 vs 0.02 (odds ratio=1.59; P=0.0028).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that there were no statistically significant least square mean changes from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) or SMA independence measures observed between risdiplam and placebo (adjusted, P=0.3902 and P=0.3902 respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the minimal clinically important difference values for functional motor scores commonly used in adults with SMA are approximately two for both the RULM and the HFMSE (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14472\" target=\"_blank\">Stolte et al. Euro J Neurol. 2020;27:2586\u201394</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the qualitative results McGraw et al. 2017, which reported that patients and caregivers highly value even small improvements and that meaningful change is relative to the functional ability already achieved (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381033/\" target=\"_blank\">McGraw et al. BMC Neurol. 2017;17:68</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that pneumonia was the most common significant adverse event (7.5% risdiplam compared with 1.7% placebo), while no fatal events were reported.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH trial was of moderate strength of small effect and considered that longer-term follow up data would need to be evaluated.</p><p>1.23.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees considered there was some uncertainty of the long-term, ongoing benefit of risdiplam, particularly in the treatment of Type 2 and 3 SMA, due to limited follow up, noting that SMA is a lifelong condition and to date only one year of follow-up data is available, but also observing that 12 months was a substantial time in the context of low survival as seen in SMA overall.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that as the two primary studies, FIREFISH and SUNFISH, were in two different SMA populations, it considered it appropriate to consider the health benefits of risdiplam in these two different groups separately.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that using 12-month data of patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA treated with nusinersen had an approximate 3.5 point increase RULM compared with 1.5 points with risdiplam (noting that the risdiplam trial had wider group of Type 3 subtypes). The Subcommittees considered that this may, in part, be explained by the differences in patient cohorts, ie. In SUNFISH the average age was nine years at study entry vs in the CHERISH study (for nusinersen) with an average age of four and exclusion of patients with scoliosis (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1710504\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:625- 35</a>); noting the marked difference in response according to age at starting treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that neither the FIREFISH nor SUNFISH results had been published formally and fully at the time of assessment, and as such had not yet undergone rigorous peer-review (especially of methods and statistical methods).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that those who would benefit most from treatment with risdiplam were individuals who would be treated early and/or with more severe disease. The Subcommittees considered that there was a high health need among patients with SMA Type 0 with the potential for these patients to benefit from SMA treatment the most, however noted that this indication was not included in this funding application. The Subcommittees noted that there was an ongoing study of risdiplam for pre-symptomatic SMA, and that they would welcome a funding application for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam is administered orally. The Subcommittees considered this to be a very suitable formulation and that it would empower family/ wh\u0101nau to deliver the medicine at home. Members noted that in comparison to other formulations for other SMA treatments (eg. intrathecal injection), an oral formulation may be more suitable. Members were made aware of anecdotal clinical experience of a possible lack of cultural acceptance of lumbar puncture in Tongan people. The Subcommittees also noted that the oral formulation would be equitably favourable for patients and family/ wh\u0101nau living in deprived or rural areas.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that there may be a risk of wastage of risdiplam, for example when bottles were taken home. Members considered that this may need to be factored into the cost of this proposal.<i> </i></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that risdiplam has not yet been recommended for funding in Australia, Canada, Scotland, or England/Wales.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the appropriate comparator for patients with Type 1, 2 and 3 SMA is best supportive care. The Subcommittees considered that motor function, bulbar function, hospitalisation, respiratory function, complications of SMA, ventilation, stamina and fatigue, mortality, and adverse effects of treatment were appropriate outcomes. The Subcommittees considered that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was not an appropriate outcome yet, as there was currently no available data in relation to risdiplam and because HRQoL is difficult to estimate in infants; the Subcommittees noted it would welcome any such data in further assessment of this application.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the supplier patient number estimates seemed reasonable. However, the Subcommittee considered that there may be some uncertainty regarding how accurately patients over the age of 18 could be identified. The Subcommittee noted the patient numbers for Type 1, 2 and 3a provided to PHARMAC by Starship Hospital staff in 2020 and considered that these figures were accurate. Members noted that recent reviews have reported an incidence of SMA up to 1 in 11,000 (<a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al.

Members considered that a conversion to full health was not supported by currently available data.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that, compared with regular intrathecal injection treatment for SMA, oral risdiplam has the potential to reduce health system costs to a greater extent, if the same or similar efficacy was achieved relative to other treatment.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittees considered that the updated FIREFISH evidence indicated a sustained meaningful benefit of risdiplam in this patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the probability of event-free survival was well maintained in the 12-24 month data (83% at 24 months). The Subcommittee noted this appeared clinically significant relative to the natural history of the disease, where a rapid decline in event free survival is observed. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the 12 and 24 month FIREFISH data is not currently published or peer reviewed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of New Zealand patients with SMA Type 1 were currently receiving compassionate access to nusinersen from the pharmaceutical company, Biogen. The Subcommittee considered that if risdiplam were funded it may be likely that the majority of these patients would switch from nusinersen to risdiplam. This was because the treatments appeared, based on current evidence, to have comparable efficacy and not to obviously differ in terms of safety. It was also anticipated that orally administered treatment would be preferred over an intrathecally administered treatment. The Subcommittees noted that there was currently no published evidence to support switching between SMA treatments, however a study (JEWELFISH) was underway to investigate this. The Subcommittees considered that advice regarding switching could be sought from relevant paediatric neurologists. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted their previously recommended provisional Special Authority criteria for risdiplam for SMA Type 1. </p><p>1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that the requirement of specific, specialist motor milestone function tests may present practical issues and would likely require input from a neurologist and specialist physiotherapist. Members considered instead that by restricting the applicants to only neurologists or paediatric neurologists, this would ensure that treatment is appropriately directed. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the renewal criteria should require demonstrated maintenance of motor milestone function (as assessed using an age-appropriate measurement), in line with the current criteria published by CADTH. </p><p>1.7.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that in New Zealand, invasive permanent ventilation is generally avoided in this patient population unless there is an overriding reason, for example, from a temporary, reversible cause unrelated to underlying SMA disease progression. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this widespread avoidance, with renewal only considered if a patient is not receiving invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent ventilation. The Subcommittees considered that, unfortunately, patients would not be expected to benefit from risdiplam once they required invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent (\u226516 hours per day) assisted ventilation. The Subcommittees noted that patients who were receiving invasive ventilation, awake non-invasive ventilation or had undergone a tracheostomy were excluded from the FIREFISH study. The Subcommittees considered that SMA patients requiring respiratory support, for intercurrent illnesses, in New Zealand are often treated with non-invasive assisted ventilation support. The Subcommittees therefore considered that this should not restrict patients from accessing risdiplam and that this should be reflected in the access criteria. </p><p><i>SMA Types 2 and 3</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the updated 24 month data of the SUNFISH trial, which investigated the use of risdiplam in patients with SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3, aged 2-25 years (unpublished). The Subcommittees noted that at 12 months, placebo patients were switched to risdiplam. The Subcommittees considered that this updated data indicated a sustained benefit with risdiplam. </p><p>1.8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the relative increase in demonstrated upper limb function (RULM, mean change 3 points) was likely to be important for the non-ambulant individuals who received this benefit.</p><p>1.8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a sustained mean change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) scores at 24 months; Members considered that while that change was not a clinically significant improvement, the maintenance of motor function was nonetheless clinically important, noting the decline otherwise observed in the natural history of SMA.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the placebo group which switched to risdiplam at month 12 demonstrated a possible small benefit or maintenance at the 24 month mark in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores, however that the delay in treatment initiation appeared to decrease the ability to benefit from risdiplam. The Subcommittee also noted that in those treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the MFM32 total score change from baseline was considerably more favourable in those aged 2-5 years (mean change 6.55, standard deviation (SD) 5.56), with the benefit reducing markedly the older a patient was when initiated on treatment (18-25 years: mean change -0.19, SD 3.12). The Subcommittees considered these points highlighted the benefit of treating SMA early. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees reiterated that the evidence for risdiplam in SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 was of moderate strength of small effect over a short timeframe. The Subcommittees also noted that neither the 12 or 24 month data for the SUNFISH trial were published or peer reviewed. However, the Subcommittees considered that risdiplam had a high biological plausibility of benefit when compared against the natural history of SMA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At this point in time, the Subcommittees did not recommend Special Authority criteria for the SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant 3 (aged under 25 years) group. The Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority should be developed to align with the patient population in the SUNFISH trial, as this is where strong benefit has been signalled. The Subcommittees also considered that the criteria should be further developed through consultation with relevant clinical experts in this field. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the current funding recommendation for nusinersen included patients with type 3a SMA aged 18 years or under, while it was recommended that risdiplam be funded for non-ambulant individuals with type 3 SMA under the age of 25 years. The Subcommittees noted that each of these recommendations reflected the groups included in the relevant clinical trials for each medicine. Members considered whether nusinersen and risdiplam should be recommended for the same patient groups, but made no recommendation on this at this time. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that a requirement for individuals with type 3 SMA to be non-ambulant may be inappropriate. Members considered that at the time of symptom onset/ diagnosis, it may be unclear whether a patient with type 3 SMA would become non-ambulant. Members considered that there was adequate evidence suggesting that the earlier a person with SMA is treated, the better the potential outcomes and waiting for a person to potentially progress to the point of non-ambulation to access funded treatment may be unreasonable. Members considered that further research into more clinically appropriate ways to target treatment, while ensuring those in the intended population are those in fact eligible for treatment, would be beneficial. </p><p><i>Cost utility (information for economic modelling purposes)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that while the 24 month data for risdiplam in Types 2 and 3 signalled continued improvement in contrast to the natural history of SMA, it was unlikely that use of risdiplam would result in a conversion to full health. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that SMA Type 3 does not affect life expectancy, while people with Type 2 have a reduced average life expectancy, although life expectancy is likely wide-ranging within the Type 2 phenotype. The Subcommittees noted uncertainty in the long-term impact of Type 2 on respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis, which may underlie the group\u2019s compromised life expectancy. The Subcommittees considered that it was unclear whether patients with SMA Type 2 who receive risdiplam would experience an increased life expectancy relative to the natural history of the condition. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that it would be reasonable, for the purposes of economic analysis, to assume that there were no health sector costs incurred for individuals with SMA Type 4 for much of their life course. However, the Subcommittees noted that patients with SMA Type 4 can experience substantial morbidity after disease onset, including being wheelchair-bound. The Subcommittees noted that there was limited literature regarding the health sector costs for SMA Type 4. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that individuals with SMA Type 3b and 4 likely do not have comparable health related quality of life, noting that both patient groups have general population life expectancy and that the types differ only in age of onset. Hence, assuming the same degree of morbidity, lifetime health-related quality of life would be on average lower for people with SMA Type 3b, given its earlier onset. Members noted it was difficult to make assumptions regarding the different \u2018types\u2019 of SMA as they are predominantly categorised by age of symptom onset and there is often clinical overlap between subtypes. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the health utility weights for SMA Types reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818531/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/95/1/e1\" target=\"_blank\">Chambers et al. 2020</a>. The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3. </p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications. </p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>). The Subcommittees considered that the international reported incidence was very similar to that in New Zealand. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a letter from a clinician regarding the funding application for risdiplam. The Subcommittees noted that while SMA is divided into subtypes, it has a spectrum of clinical severity and all affected individuals have the same underlying pathological process. The Subcommittees considered the potential impact of \u2018splitting\u2019 access to treatment by SMA subtype. Members considered this was an important issue when considering funding applications for SMA, and recommended that relevant clinical experts be consulted and involved. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that preliminary, unpublished data of the RAINBOWFISH trial was available. The Subcommittees noted that the RAINBOWFISH trial was an open-label, single arm study investigating the use of risdiplam in infants with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA. </p><p>1.22.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees noted that of the five patients treated with risdiplam for at least 12 months, all five met \u2018near maximum\u2019 CHOP-INTEND scores by 4-5 months of age, while 80% (N=4) infants achieved HINE-2 motor milestones. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the pre-symptomatic SMA group had the greatest potential to benefit from treatment, and would welcome further data and any funding applications for this patient population.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3. </p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications. </p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>). The Subcommittees considered that the international reported incidence was very similar to that in New Zealand. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a letter from a clinician regarding the funding application for risdiplam. The Subcommittees noted that while SMA is divided into subtypes, it has a spectrum of clinical severity and all affected individuals have the same underlying pathological process. The Subcommittees considered the potential impact of \u2018splitting\u2019 access to treatment by SMA subtype. Members considered this was an important issue when considering funding applications for SMA, and recommended that relevant clinical experts be consulted and involved. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that preliminary, unpublished data of the RAINBOWFISH trial was available. The Subcommittees noted that the RAINBOWFISH trial was an open-label, single arm study investigating the use of risdiplam in infants with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA. </p><p>1.22.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees noted that of the five patients treated with risdiplam for at least 12 months, all five met \u2018near maximum\u2019 CHOP-INTEND scores by 4-5 months of age, while 80% (N=4) infants achieved HINE-2 motor milestones. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the pre-symptomatic SMA group had the greatest potential to benefit from treatment, and would welcome further data and any funding applications for this patient population.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittees considered that the updated FIREFISH evidence indicated a sustained meaningful benefit of risdiplam in this patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the probability of event-free survival was well maintained in the 12-24 month data (83% at 24 months). The Subcommittee noted this appeared clinically significant relative to the natural history of the disease, where a rapid decline in event free survival is observed. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the 12 and 24 month FIREFISH data is not currently published or peer reviewed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of New Zealand patients with SMA Type 1 were currently receiving compassionate access to nusinersen from the pharmaceutical company, Biogen. The Subcommittee considered that if risdiplam were funded it may be likely that the majority of these patients would switch from nusinersen to risdiplam. This was because the treatments appeared, based on current evidence, to have comparable efficacy and not to obviously differ in terms of safety. It was also anticipated that orally administered treatment would be preferred over an intrathecally administered treatment. The Subcommittees noted that there was currently no published evidence to support switching between SMA treatments, however a study (JEWELFISH) was underway to investigate this. The Subcommittees considered that advice regarding switching could be sought from relevant paediatric neurologists. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted their previously recommended provisional Special Authority criteria for risdiplam for SMA Type 1. </p><p>1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that the requirement of specific, specialist motor milestone function tests may present practical issues and would likely require input from a neurologist and specialist physiotherapist. Members considered instead that by restricting the applicants to only neurologists or paediatric neurologists, this would ensure that treatment is appropriately directed. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the renewal criteria should require demonstrated maintenance of motor milestone function (as assessed using an age-appropriate measurement), in line with the current criteria published by CADTH. </p><p>1.7.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that in New Zealand, invasive permanent ventilation is generally avoided in this patient population unless there is an overriding reason, for example, from a temporary, reversible cause unrelated to underlying SMA disease progression. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this widespread avoidance, with renewal only considered if a patient is not receiving invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent ventilation. The Subcommittees considered that, unfortunately, patients would not be expected to benefit from risdiplam once they required invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent (\u226516 hours per day) assisted ventilation. The Subcommittees noted that patients who were receiving invasive ventilation, awake non-invasive ventilation or had undergone a tracheostomy were excluded from the FIREFISH study. The Subcommittees considered that SMA patients requiring respiratory support, for intercurrent illnesses, in New Zealand are often treated with non-invasive assisted ventilation support. The Subcommittees therefore considered that this should not restrict patients from accessing risdiplam and that this should be reflected in the access criteria. </p><p><i>SMA Types 2 and 3</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the updated 24 month data of the SUNFISH trial, which investigated the use of risdiplam in patients with SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3, aged 2-25 years (unpublished). The Subcommittees noted that at 12 months, placebo patients were switched to risdiplam. The Subcommittees considered that this updated data indicated a sustained benefit with risdiplam. </p><p>1.8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the relative increase in demonstrated upper limb function (RULM, mean change 3 points) was likely to be important for the non-ambulant individuals who received this benefit.</p><p>1.8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a sustained mean change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) scores at 24 months; Members considered that while that change was not a clinically significant improvement, the maintenance of motor function was nonetheless clinically important, noting the decline otherwise observed in the natural history of SMA.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the placebo group which switched to risdiplam at month 12 demonstrated a possible small benefit or maintenance at the 24 month mark in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores, however that the delay in treatment initiation appeared to decrease the ability to benefit from risdiplam. The Subcommittee also noted that in those treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the MFM32 total score change from baseline was considerably more favourable in those aged 2-5 years (mean change 6.55, standard deviation (SD) 5.56), with the benefit reducing markedly the older a patient was when initiated on treatment (18-25 years: mean change -0.19, SD 3.12). The Subcommittees considered these points highlighted the benefit of treating SMA early. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees reiterated that the evidence for risdiplam in SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 was of moderate strength of small effect over a short timeframe. The Subcommittees also noted that neither the 12 or 24 month data for the SUNFISH trial were published or peer reviewed. However, the Subcommittees considered that risdiplam had a high biological plausibility of benefit when compared against the natural history of SMA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At this point in time, the Subcommittees did not recommend Special Authority criteria for the SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant 3 (aged under 25 years) group. The Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority should be developed to align with the patient population in the SUNFISH trial, as this is where strong benefit has been signalled. The Subcommittees also considered that the criteria should be further developed through consultation with relevant clinical experts in this field. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the current funding recommendation for nusinersen included patients with type 3a SMA aged 18 years or under, while it was recommended that risdiplam be funded for non-ambulant individuals with type 3 SMA under the age of 25 years. The Subcommittees noted that each of these recommendations reflected the groups included in the relevant clinical trials for each medicine. Members considered whether nusinersen and risdiplam should be recommended for the same patient groups, but made no recommendation on this at this time. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that a requirement for individuals with type 3 SMA to be non-ambulant may be inappropriate. Members considered that at the time of symptom onset/ diagnosis, it may be unclear whether a patient with type 3 SMA would become non-ambulant. Members considered that there was adequate evidence suggesting that the earlier a person with SMA is treated, the better the potential outcomes and waiting for a person to potentially progress to the point of non-ambulation to access funded treatment may be unreasonable. Members considered that further research into more clinically appropriate ways to target treatment, while ensuring those in the intended population are those in fact eligible for treatment, would be beneficial. </p><p><i>Cost utility (information for economic modelling purposes)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that while the 24 month data for risdiplam in Types 2 and 3 signalled continued improvement in contrast to the natural history of SMA, it was unlikely that use of risdiplam would result in a conversion to full health. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that SMA Type 3 does not affect life expectancy, while people with Type 2 have a reduced average life expectancy, although life expectancy is likely wide-ranging within the Type 2 phenotype. The Subcommittees noted uncertainty in the long-term impact of Type 2 on respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis, which may underlie the group\u2019s compromised life expectancy. The Subcommittees considered that it was unclear whether patients with SMA Type 2 who receive risdiplam would experience an increased life expectancy relative to the natural history of the condition. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that it would be reasonable, for the purposes of economic analysis, to assume that there were no health sector costs incurred for individuals with SMA Type 4 for much of their life course. However, the Subcommittees noted that patients with SMA Type 4 can experience substantial morbidity after disease onset, including being wheelchair-bound. The Subcommittees noted that there was limited literature regarding the health sector costs for SMA Type 4. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that individuals with SMA Type 3b and 4 likely do not have comparable health related quality of life, noting that both patient groups have general population life expectancy and that the types differ only in age of onset. Hence, assuming the same degree of morbidity, lifetime health-related quality of life would be on average lower for people with SMA Type 3b, given its earlier onset. Members noted it was difficult to make assumptions regarding the different \u2018types\u2019 of SMA as they are predominantly categorised by age of symptom onset and there is often clinical overlap between subtypes. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the health utility weights for SMA Types reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818531/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/95/1/e1\" target=\"_blank\">Chambers et al. 2020</a>. The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3. </p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications. </p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>). The Subcommittees considered that the international reported incidence was very similar to that in New Zealand. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a letter from a clinician regarding the funding application for risdiplam.

The Subcommittees considered that the updated FIREFISH evidence indicated a sustained meaningful benefit of risdiplam in this patient population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the probability of event-free survival was well maintained in the 12-24 month data (83% at 24 months). The Subcommittee noted this appeared clinically significant relative to the natural history of the disease, where a rapid decline in event free survival is observed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the 12 and 24 month FIREFISH data is not currently published or peer reviewed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of New Zealand patients with SMA Type 1 were currently receiving compassionate access to nusinersen from the pharmaceutical company, Biogen. The Subcommittee considered that if risdiplam were funded it may be likely that the majority of these patients would switch from nusinersen to risdiplam. This was because the treatments appeared, based on current evidence, to have comparable efficacy and not to obviously differ in terms of safety. It was also anticipated that orally administered treatment would be preferred over an intrathecally administered treatment. The Subcommittees noted that there was currently no published evidence to support switching between SMA treatments, however a study (JEWELFISH) was underway to investigate this. The Subcommittees considered that advice regarding switching could be sought from relevant paediatric neurologists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted their previously recommended provisional Special Authority criteria for risdiplam for SMA Type 1.</p><p>1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that the requirement of specific, specialist motor milestone function tests may present practical issues and would likely require input from a neurologist and specialist physiotherapist. Members considered instead that by restricting the applicants to only neurologists or paediatric neurologists, this would ensure that treatment is appropriately directed. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the renewal criteria should require demonstrated maintenance of motor milestone function (as assessed using an age-appropriate measurement), in line with the current criteria published by CADTH.</p><p>1.7.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that in New Zealand, invasive permanent ventilation is generally avoided in this patient population unless there is an overriding reason, for example, from a temporary, reversible cause unrelated to underlying SMA disease progression. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this widespread avoidance, with renewal only considered if a patient is not receiving invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent ventilation. The Subcommittees considered that, unfortunately, patients would not be expected to benefit from risdiplam once they required invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent (\u226516 hours per day) assisted ventilation. The Subcommittees noted that patients who were receiving invasive ventilation, awake non-invasive ventilation or had undergone a tracheostomy were excluded from the FIREFISH study. The Subcommittees considered that SMA patients requiring respiratory support, for intercurrent illnesses, in New Zealand are often treated with non-invasive assisted ventilation support. The Subcommittees therefore considered that this should not restrict patients from accessing risdiplam and that this should be reflected in the access criteria.</p><p><i>SMA Types 2 and 3</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the updated 24 month data of the SUNFISH trial, which investigated the use of risdiplam in patients with SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3, aged 2-25 years (unpublished). The Subcommittees noted that at 12 months, placebo patients were switched to risdiplam. The Subcommittees considered that this updated data indicated a sustained benefit with risdiplam.</p><p>1.8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the relative increase in demonstrated upper limb function (RULM, mean change 3 points) was likely to be important for the non-ambulant individuals who received this benefit.</p><p>1.8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a sustained mean change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) scores at 24 months; Members considered that while that change was not a clinically significant improvement, the maintenance of motor function was nonetheless clinically important, noting the decline otherwise observed in the natural history of SMA.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the placebo group which switched to risdiplam at month 12 demonstrated a possible small benefit or maintenance at the 24 month mark in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores, however that the delay in treatment initiation appeared to decrease the ability to benefit from risdiplam. The Subcommittee also noted that in those treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the MFM32 total score change from baseline was considerably more favourable in those aged 2-5 years (mean change 6.55, standard deviation (SD) 5.56), with the benefit reducing markedly the older a patient was when initiated on treatment (18-25 years: mean change -0.19, SD 3.12). The Subcommittees considered these points highlighted the benefit of treating SMA early.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees reiterated that the evidence for risdiplam in SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 was of moderate strength of small effect over a short timeframe. The Subcommittees also noted that neither the 12 or 24 month data for the SUNFISH trial were published or peer reviewed. However, the Subcommittees considered that risdiplam had a high biological plausibility of benefit when compared against the natural history of SMA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At this point in time, the Subcommittees did not recommend Special Authority criteria for the SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant 3 (aged under 25 years) group. The Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority should be developed to align with the patient population in the SUNFISH trial, as this is where strong benefit has been signalled. The Subcommittees also considered that the criteria should be further developed through consultation with relevant clinical experts in this field.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the current funding recommendation for nusinersen included patients with type 3a SMA aged 18 years or under, while it was recommended that risdiplam be funded for non-ambulant individuals with type 3 SMA under the age of 25 years. The Subcommittees noted that each of these recommendations reflected the groups included in the relevant clinical trials for each medicine. Members considered whether nusinersen and risdiplam should be recommended for the same patient groups, but made no recommendation on this at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that a requirement for individuals with type 3 SMA to be non-ambulant may be inappropriate. Members considered that at the time of symptom onset/ diagnosis, it may be unclear whether a patient with type 3 SMA would become non-ambulant. Members considered that there was adequate evidence suggesting that the earlier a person with SMA is treated, the better the potential outcomes and waiting for a person to potentially progress to the point of non-ambulation to access funded treatment may be unreasonable. Members considered that further research into more clinically appropriate ways to target treatment, while ensuring those in the intended population are those in fact eligible for treatment, would be beneficial.</p><p><i>Cost utility (information for economic modelling purposes)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that while the 24 month data for risdiplam in Types 2 and 3 signalled continued improvement in contrast to the natural history of SMA, it was unlikely that use of risdiplam would result in a conversion to full health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that SMA Type 3 does not affect life expectancy, while people with Type 2 have a reduced average life expectancy, although life expectancy is likely wide-ranging within the Type 2 phenotype. The Subcommittees noted uncertainty in the long-term impact of Type 2 on respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis, which may underlie the group\u2019s compromised life expectancy. The Subcommittees considered that it was unclear whether patients with SMA Type 2 who receive risdiplam would experience an increased life expectancy relative to the natural history of the condition.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that it would be reasonable, for the purposes of economic analysis, to assume that there were no health sector costs incurred for individuals with SMA Type 4 for much of their life course. However, the Subcommittees noted that patients with SMA Type 4 can experience substantial morbidity after disease onset, including being wheelchair-bound. The Subcommittees noted that there was limited literature regarding the health sector costs for SMA Type 4.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that individuals with SMA Type 3b and 4 likely do not have comparable health related quality of life, noting that both patient groups have general population life expectancy and that the types differ only in age of onset. Hence, assuming the same degree of morbidity, lifetime health-related quality of life would be on average lower for people with SMA Type 3b, given its earlier onset. Members noted it was difficult to make assumptions regarding the different \u2018types\u2019 of SMA as they are predominantly categorised by age of symptom onset and there is often clinical overlap between subtypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the health utility weights for SMA Types reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818531/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/95/1/e1\" target=\"_blank\">Chambers et al. 2020</a>. The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3.</p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications.</p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>).

The Subcommittees noted that while SMA is divided into subtypes, it has a spectrum of clinical severity and all affected individuals have the same underlying pathological process. The Subcommittees considered the potential impact of \u2018splitting\u2019 access to treatment by SMA subtype.

The Subcommittees considered that this updated data indicated a sustained benefit with risdiplam.</p><p>1.8.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the relative increase in demonstrated upper limb function (RULM, mean change 3 points) was likely to be important for the non-ambulant individuals who received this benefit.</p><p>1.8.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a sustained mean change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) scores at 24 months; Members considered that while that change was not a clinically significant improvement, the maintenance of motor function was nonetheless clinically important, noting the decline otherwise observed in the natural history of SMA.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the placebo group which switched to risdiplam at month 12 demonstrated a possible small benefit or maintenance at the 24 month mark in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) scores, however that the delay in treatment initiation appeared to decrease the ability to benefit from risdiplam. The Subcommittee also noted that in those treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the MFM32 total score change from baseline was considerably more favourable in those aged 2-5 years (mean change 6.55, standard deviation (SD) 5.56), with the benefit reducing markedly the older a patient was when initiated on treatment (18-25 years: mean change -0.19, SD 3.12). The Subcommittees considered these points highlighted the benefit of treating SMA early.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees reiterated that the evidence for risdiplam in SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 was of moderate strength of small effect over a short timeframe. The Subcommittees also noted that neither the 12 or 24 month data for the SUNFISH trial were published or peer reviewed. However, the Subcommittees considered that risdiplam had a high biological plausibility of benefit when compared against the natural history of SMA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At this point in time, the Subcommittees did not recommend Special Authority criteria for the SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant 3 (aged under 25 years) group. The Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority should be developed to align with the patient population in the SUNFISH trial, as this is where strong benefit has been signalled. The Subcommittees also considered that the criteria should be further developed through consultation with relevant clinical experts in this field.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the current funding recommendation for nusinersen included patients with type 3a SMA aged 18 years or under, while it was recommended that risdiplam be funded for non-ambulant individuals with type 3 SMA under the age of 25 years. The Subcommittees noted that each of these recommendations reflected the groups included in the relevant clinical trials for each medicine. Members considered whether nusinersen and risdiplam should be recommended for the same patient groups, but made no recommendation on this at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that a requirement for individuals with type 3 SMA to be non-ambulant may be inappropriate. Members considered that at the time of symptom onset/ diagnosis, it may be unclear whether a patient with type 3 SMA would become non-ambulant. Members considered that there was adequate evidence suggesting that the earlier a person with SMA is treated, the better the potential outcomes and waiting for a person to potentially progress to the point of non-ambulation to access funded treatment may be unreasonable. Members considered that further research into more clinically appropriate ways to target treatment, while ensuring those in the intended population are those in fact eligible for treatment, would be beneficial.</p><p><i>Cost utility (information for economic modelling purposes)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that while the 24 month data for risdiplam in Types 2 and 3 signalled continued improvement in contrast to the natural history of SMA, it was unlikely that use of risdiplam would result in a conversion to full health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that SMA Type 3 does not affect life expectancy, while people with Type 2 have a reduced average life expectancy, although life expectancy is likely wide-ranging within the Type 2 phenotype. The Subcommittees noted uncertainty in the long-term impact of Type 2 on respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis, which may underlie the group\u2019s compromised life expectancy. The Subcommittees considered that it was unclear whether patients with SMA Type 2 who receive risdiplam would experience an increased life expectancy relative to the natural history of the condition.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that it would be reasonable, for the purposes of economic analysis, to assume that there were no health sector costs incurred for individuals with SMA Type 4 for much of their life course. However, the Subcommittees noted that patients with SMA Type 4 can experience substantial morbidity after disease onset, including being wheelchair-bound. The Subcommittees noted that there was limited literature regarding the health sector costs for SMA Type 4.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that individuals with SMA Type 3b and 4 likely do not have comparable health related quality of life, noting that both patient groups have general population life expectancy and that the types differ only in age of onset. Hence, assuming the same degree of morbidity, lifetime health-related quality of life would be on average lower for people with SMA Type 3b, given its earlier onset. Members noted it was difficult to make assumptions regarding the different \u2018types\u2019 of SMA as they are predominantly categorised by age of symptom onset and there is often clinical overlap between subtypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the health utility weights for SMA Types reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818531/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/95/1/e1\" target=\"_blank\">Chambers et al. 2020</a>. The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3.</p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications.</p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>). The Subcommittees considered that the international reported incidence was very similar to that in New Zealand.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a letter from a clinician regarding the funding application for risdiplam. The Subcommittees noted that while SMA is divided into subtypes, it has a spectrum of clinical severity and all affected individuals have the same underlying pathological process. The Subcommittees considered the potential impact of \u2018splitting\u2019 access to treatment by SMA subtype. Members considered this was an important issue when considering funding applications for SMA, and recommended that relevant clinical experts be consulted and involved.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that preliminary, unpublished data of the RAINBOWFISH trial was available. The Subcommittees noted that the RAINBOWFISH trial was an open-label, single arm study investigating the use of risdiplam in infants with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA.</p><p>1.22.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees noted that of the five patients treated with risdiplam for at least 12 months, all five met \u2018near maximum\u2019 CHOP-INTEND scores by 4-5 months of age, while 80% (N=4) infants achieved HINE-2 motor milestones.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the pre-symptomatic SMA group had the greatest potential to benefit from treatment, and would welcome further data and any funding applications for this patient population.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittees considered that the updated FIREFISH evidence indicated a sustained meaningful benefit of risdiplam in this patient population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the probability of event-free survival was well maintained in the 12-24 month data (83% at 24 months). The Subcommittee noted this appeared clinically significant relative to the natural history of the disease, where a rapid decline in event free survival is observed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the 12 and 24 month FIREFISH data is not currently published or peer reviewed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of New Zealand patients with SMA Type 1 were currently receiving compassionate access to nusinersen from the pharmaceutical company, Biogen. The Subcommittee considered that if risdiplam were funded it may be likely that the majority of these patients would switch from nusinersen to risdiplam. This was because the treatments appeared, based on current evidence, to have comparable efficacy and not to obviously differ in terms of safety. It was also anticipated that orally administered treatment would be preferred over an intrathecally administered treatment. The Subcommittees noted that there was currently no published evidence to support switching between SMA treatments, however a study (JEWELFISH) was underway to investigate this. The Subcommittees considered that advice regarding switching could be sought from relevant paediatric neurologists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted their previously recommended provisional Special Authority criteria for risdiplam for SMA Type 1.</p><p>1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that the requirement of specific, specialist motor milestone function tests may present practical issues and would likely require input from a neurologist and specialist physiotherapist. Members considered instead that by restricting the applicants to only neurologists or paediatric neurologists, this would ensure that treatment is appropriately directed. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the renewal criteria should require demonstrated maintenance of motor milestone function (as assessed using an age-appropriate measurement), in line with the current criteria published by CADTH.</p><p>1.7.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that in New Zealand, invasive permanent ventilation is generally avoided in this patient population unless there is an overriding reason, for example, from a temporary, reversible cause unrelated to underlying SMA disease progression. As such, the Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this widespread avoidance, with renewal only considered if a patient is not receiving invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent ventilation. The Subcommittees considered that, unfortunately, patients would not be expected to benefit from risdiplam once they required invasive ventilation or non-invasive permanent (\u226516 hours per day) assisted ventilation. The Subcommittees noted that patients who were receiving invasive ventilation, awake non-invasive ventilation or had undergone a tracheostomy were excluded from the FIREFISH study. The Subcommittees considered that SMA patients requiring respiratory support, for intercurrent illnesses, in New Zealand are often treated with non-invasive assisted ventilation support. The Subcommittees therefore considered that this should not restrict patients from accessing risdiplam and that this should be reflected in the access criteria.</p><p><i>SMA Types 2 and 3</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the updated 24 month data of the SUNFISH trial, which investigated the use of risdiplam in patients with SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3, aged 2-25 years (unpublished). The Subcommittees noted that at 12 months, placebo patients were switched to risdiplam.

The Subcommittee also noted that in those treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the MFM32 total score change from baseline was considerably more favourable in those aged 2-5 years (mean change 6.55, standard deviation (SD) 5.56), with the benefit reducing markedly the older a patient was when initiated on treatment (18-25 years: mean change -0.19, SD 3.12). The Subcommittees considered these points highlighted the benefit of treating SMA early.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees reiterated that the evidence for risdiplam in SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 was of moderate strength of small effect over a short timeframe. The Subcommittees also noted that neither the 12 or 24 month data for the SUNFISH trial were published or peer reviewed. However, the Subcommittees considered that risdiplam had a high biological plausibility of benefit when compared against the natural history of SMA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At this point in time, the Subcommittees did not recommend Special Authority criteria for the SMA Type 2 and non-ambulant 3 (aged under 25 years) group. The Subcommittees considered that the Special Authority should be developed to align with the patient population in the SUNFISH trial, as this is where strong benefit has been signalled. The Subcommittees also considered that the criteria should be further developed through consultation with relevant clinical experts in this field.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that the current funding recommendation for nusinersen included patients with type 3a SMA aged 18 years or under, while it was recommended that risdiplam be funded for non-ambulant individuals with type 3 SMA under the age of 25 years. The Subcommittees noted that each of these recommendations reflected the groups included in the relevant clinical trials for each medicine. Members considered whether nusinersen and risdiplam should be recommended for the same patient groups, but made no recommendation on this at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members considered that a requirement for individuals with type 3 SMA to be non-ambulant may be inappropriate. Members considered that at the time of symptom onset/ diagnosis, it may be unclear whether a patient with type 3 SMA would become non-ambulant. Members considered that there was adequate evidence suggesting that the earlier a person with SMA is treated, the better the potential outcomes and waiting for a person to potentially progress to the point of non-ambulation to access funded treatment may be unreasonable. Members considered that further research into more clinically appropriate ways to target treatment, while ensuring those in the intended population are those in fact eligible for treatment, would be beneficial.</p><p><i>Cost utility (information for economic modelling purposes)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that while the 24 month data for risdiplam in Types 2 and 3 signalled continued improvement in contrast to the natural history of SMA, it was unlikely that use of risdiplam would result in a conversion to full health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that SMA Type 3 does not affect life expectancy, while people with Type 2 have a reduced average life expectancy, although life expectancy is likely wide-ranging within the Type 2 phenotype. The Subcommittees noted uncertainty in the long-term impact of Type 2 on respiratory muscle weakness and scoliosis, which may underlie the group\u2019s compromised life expectancy. The Subcommittees considered that it was unclear whether patients with SMA Type 2 who receive risdiplam would experience an increased life expectancy relative to the natural history of the condition.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that it would be reasonable, for the purposes of economic analysis, to assume that there were no health sector costs incurred for individuals with SMA Type 4 for much of their life course. However, the Subcommittees noted that patients with SMA Type 4 can experience substantial morbidity after disease onset, including being wheelchair-bound. The Subcommittees noted that there was limited literature regarding the health sector costs for SMA Type 4.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that individuals with SMA Type 3b and 4 likely do not have comparable health related quality of life, noting that both patient groups have general population life expectancy and that the types differ only in age of onset. Hence, assuming the same degree of morbidity, lifetime health-related quality of life would be on average lower for people with SMA Type 3b, given its earlier onset. Members noted it was difficult to make assumptions regarding the different \u2018types\u2019 of SMA as they are predominantly categorised by age of symptom onset and there is often clinical overlap between subtypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted the health utility weights for SMA Types reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6818531/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://n.neurology.org/content/95/1/e1\" target=\"_blank\">Chambers et al. 2020</a>. The Subcommittees noted the difference in methodologies and the resulting differences in weights, particularly for Type 3.</p><p>1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Members noted that the study by Lloyd et al. 2019 applied a very large weight to ambulation, in distinguishing between utility weights with different sets of symptoms of SMA Type 3. The Subcommittee considered that the Lloyd et al. 2019 utility weight was an estimate of health-related quality of life for people with SMA Type 1 who had converted to a SMA Type 3 phenotype after responding to treatment. The Lloyd et al. 2019 SMA Type 3 utility was considered a more appropriate estimate in this group, while the Committee noted that Chambers et al. 2020 had estimated a utility weight in patients with a diagnosis of SMA Type 3, which may be more appropriate for people with this diagnosis at onset.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted that the SUNFISH trial included SMA Type 2 (N=84) and non-ambulant individuals with SMA Type 3 (N=36). The Subcommittees noted that the benefit received from risdiplam was similar between the two subpopulations for some outcomes (eg. MFM32 score). Members noted that ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with SMA have different baseline motor function (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26776503/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercuri et al. 2016)</a> and as such it could be assumed that the ability to benefit from risdiplam would differ between ambulant and non-ambulant people with SMA. From this, the Subcommittees considered that the SUNFISH data was not generalisable to ambulant Type 3 individuals. This was reflected in the Subcommittees\u2019 recommendation for the particular Type 3 indications.</p><p><i>General </i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the recent, international incidence data of SMA of 0.78 per 10,000 was consistent with previous estimates from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19154529/\" target=\"_blank\">Arkblad et al. 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Verhaart et al. 2017</a> (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangouloff et al. 2021</a>). The Subcommittees considered that the international reported incidence was very similar to that in New Zealand.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted a letter from a clinician regarding the funding application for risdiplam. The Subcommittees noted that while SMA is divided into subtypes, it has a spectrum of clinical severity and all affected individuals have the same underlying pathological process. The Subcommittees considered the potential impact of \u2018splitting\u2019 access to treatment by SMA subtype. Members considered this was an important issue when considering funding applications for SMA, and recommended that relevant clinical experts be consulted and involved.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees noted that preliminary, unpublished data of the RAINBOWFISH trial was available. The Subcommittees noted that the RAINBOWFISH trial was an open-label, single arm study investigating the use of risdiplam in infants with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA.</p><p>1.22.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittees noted that of the five patients treated with risdiplam for at least 12 months, all five met \u2018near maximum\u2019 CHOP-INTEND scores by 4-5 months of age, while 80% (N=4) infants achieved HINE-2 motor milestones.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittees considered that the pre-symptomatic SMA group had the greatest potential to benefit from treatment, and would welcome further data and any funding applications for this patient population.\u00a0</p>",

        "Published_Discussion": {
          "s": "<p><b>Health need</b></p><p>1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the most common form of SMA is caused by a defect in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5, and that 94% of SMA patients have a deletion in exon 7. The Committee noted that the defect is an autosomal recessive deletion which causes an SMN protein deficiency leading to motor neuron degeneration and subsequent disease progression. The Committee also noted that the SMN2 gene adjacent to SMN1 also produces SMN protein, of which 10-15% is functional as most is truncated and rapidly degraded following translation. The Committee noted that individuals vary in the number of copies of SMN2, which can range from 0 to 8.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that classification of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is based on age of onset and maximal motor function achieved: pre-natal type 0 SMA patients achieve no motor function, are unable to sit or roll, and die within weeks of birth; infantile onset type I SMA patients present with symptoms at less than 6 months of age, are unable to sit or roll, and typically die within 2 years; childhood onset type II SMA patients present with symptoms at 6 to 18 months of age, can sit but are unable to walk independently, and survive to adulthood in 70% of cases; childhood onset type III SMA patients present with symptoms before age 3 (type IIIa), older then age 3 (type IIIb) or between 12 and 18 years of age (IIIc), can independently stand or walk but may lose the ability to walk over time, and have a normal lifespan; and adult onset type IV SMA patients present after age 18, have normal or mildly impaired motor function, and a normal lifespan.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients typically experience an acute phase of new onset of weakness, followed by a chronic phase of functional decline, and that the evolution from the acute to chronic phase depends on the SMA type. The Committee noted that SMA is the most common monogenic cause of infant mortality worldwide. The Committee noted that there is no funded treatment for SMA in New Zealand, and that best supportive care for SMA patients includes physiotherapy, nutritional support, respiratory support, orthopaedic support, and palliative care, all of which come as a significant cost to the health system and patients\u2019 families.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the health need for SMA type I patients is severe, as most do not live past the age of two years. The Committee also noted that SMA types II and III have a poor outlook in terms of mobility, independence, and quality of life; the majority of patients never walk or lose the ability to walk before reaching adolescence or adulthood. The Committee also noted that the lifetime probability of scoliosis surgery in type II SMA patients is approximately 80%, while SMA type IIIa has a risk of approximately 40%, which is strongly associated with the age of onset of loss of ambulation. The Committee noted than for SMA type IIIa, scoliosis surgery is needed in 71% of patients who lose the ability to walk before the age of 10, versus 22% in patients who lose the ability to talk after the age of 10 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164393/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Wijngaarde et al. Neurology. 2019;93:e149-e158</a>). The Committee noted that the major cause of morbidity and mortality in SMA patients is respiratory failure.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is also a high health need for family, wh\u0101nau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families and support systems. The Committee considered that only patients belonging to households with the financial means to relocate are able to make the choice to move overseas, and that those with more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. The Committee also noted that specialist clinicians have indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific SMA patients present later due to inequities in access to primary care, which must be considered in the context of access criteria relating to age of diagnosis. The Committee noted that there is a wider societal impact relating to SMA patients who move to adulthood due to different healthcare, educational and transport needs for these individuals.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were 74 SMA patients in New Zealand as at March 2019, 36 of whom were under the age of 18. The Committee noted that the point prevalence of SMA in New Zealand is 1.4 per 100,000, and therefore meets <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Pharmac\u2019s working definition for funding a \u2018rare disorder</a>\u2019 (1 per 50,000), and that the incidence is 0.8 per 10,000. The Committee noted that results from new-born screening programmes across nine international programmes reported an incidence of 0.78 per 10,000 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Dangouloff et al. Neuromuscular Discord. 2021;31:574-82</a>). The Committee noted that there is currently no screening programme for SMA in New Zealand and considered that if any SMA treatment were to be funded here, a screening programme would likely be rapidly implemented alongside this. The Committee noted that the carrier mutation frequency for SMA ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 90 people globally (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21811307/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Sugarman et al.

J Med Genet. 1978;15:409-13</a>).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a funding application for nusinersen, which is not currently funded in New Zealand, for the treatment of SMA was reviewed by the Rare Disorders Subcommittee (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorders-subcommittee-minutes-2018-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">November 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorder-subcommittee-record-nusinersen-for-spinal-muscular-atrophy-SMA-2019-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">September 2019</a>) where the application received a high priority recommendation for pre-symptomatic individuals with spinal muscular atrophy and two or three SMN2 copies, and a medium priority recommendation for symptomatic patients with type I, II, and IIIa spinal muscular atrophy. The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2020</a> and recommended nusinersen be funded with a high priority for both patient groups. The Committee noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally, thus only has an effect on the central nervous system.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that risdiplam is a small molecule that modulates SMN2 gene splicing, binding two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA, allowing full length SMN mRNA and protein to be synthesised and that systemic distribution has been demonstrated in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs in vivo. The Committee considered that this was significant as SMA is a multiorgan disease with cardiac, muscular, respiratory, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic effects. The Committee noted that risdiplam is not yet Medsafe approved for use in New Zealand, and that there is no FDA approval for use in children under two months of age as there is no safety data for this patient group.</p><p>Evidence</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of SMA depends on the number of SMN2 copies an individual patient has. The Committee noted that because risdiplam acts on the SMN2 protein, patients must have 2 or more copies of SMN2 to derive benefit from risdiplam. The Committee noted that risdiplam is a powder that must be mixed into a solution and administered orally once daily, while nusinersen is administered intrathecally 4-monthly (following loading doses). The Committee considered that oral administration may be more appropriate for patients who have undergone scoliosis surgery, as intrathecal administration may be difficult for these patients. The Committee considered however that adherence with very young children may be an issue, as babies often have reflux or vomit after feeding, but noted that this was not described in the clinical study data for risdiplam.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are four ongoing phase II clinical studies assessing the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in different SMA types: FIREFISH (SMA type I), SUNFISH (SMA types II and non-ambulant type III), JEWELFISH (SMA patients previously treated with other SMA agents), and RAINBOWFISH (genetically diagnosed, pre-symptomatic SMA patients). The Committee noted that only FIREFISH and SUNFISH are relevant to the current consideration for risdiplam. The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference variables for outcomes in these trials are mostly uncertain and unvalidated, with the exception of the Hammersmith Infant Neuromuscular Examination (HINE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be a one-point increase, and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be more than two points, however the Committee considered that patients and caregivers would likely still consider a one-point increase to be meaningful.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that FIREFISH is a level 2B phase II open-label, two-part study for those with SMA type I and a confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA with 2 or more SMN2 gene copies (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34320287/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Darras et al. N Engl J Med. 2021;385:427-35</a>). The Committee noted that there were 41 patients enrolled in the study, and that the median age of enrolment was 5.3 months. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the proportion of infants sitting unsupported for 5 seconds or more, and secondary endpoints of event-free survival (alive without permanent ventilation), motor milestone achievement, and CHOP-INTEND scale of motor function results.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.11.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at baseline, 95% of patients were able to swallow, 29% were receiving pulmonary care, and that no infants were sitting without support. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was met after 12 months with 29% of infants in the clinical study being able to sit without support for 5 seconds or longer (90% CI 18% to 43%). The Committee also noted that at 12 months 93% of study participants were alive, which the study compared to a historical cohort with a median time to death of 6 months in SMA type I at less and 3 months age at onset and 11.5 months for greater than 3 months at onset (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25080519/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Finkel et al.

The Committee noted that there were 180 participants enrolled in the trial, and that the median age at enrolment was nine years of age (range from 2 to 25 years). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was a change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) total score at 12 months in relation to maximum score of 96, and that secondary endpoints were motor function, respiratory function, clinical global impression (which assesses the clinician\u2019s impression of a patients\u2019 mental health state) and patient/caregiver reported outcomes.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients enrolled represented a broad clinical range of SMA, with 71% of participants with SMA type II, and 29% with SMA type III who were non-ambulant; all had 2 to 4 copies of the <i>SMN2 </i>gene. The Committee also noted that the mean MFM32 total score at baseline was 46.11 with a range of 16.7 to 71.9.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.2 The Committee noted that 32% of participants had severe scoliosis at the time of enrolment, and 26% had scoliosis surgery prior to screening. The Committee noted that patients with severe scoliosis and prior scoliosis surgery were excluded from the CHERISH nusinersen study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019106/\" target=\"_blank\">Darras et al.

The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference for MFM32 in SMA patients is unclear, but noted that in a congenital muscular dystrophy observational study the minimally clinically important difference in MFM32 score was 2.5 to 3.9 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166523/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Goff et al.

The Committee also noted that respiratory function (as measured by a least squares mean change in baseline in the best percentage-predicted forced expiratory volume) was -5.16 in the risdiplam treatment group versus -3.11 in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of -2.05 (95% CI -6.67 to 2.56).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.5\u00a0The Committee noted that the proportion of individuals rated as \u2018improved\u2019 on the clinical global impression scale was 47.5% in the risdiplam group and 40% in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 1.38 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.47).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.6\u00a0The Committee noted that 20% of patients treated with risdiplam experienced at least one serious adverse event, versus 18.3% in the placebo group, and that there were no deaths. The Committee also noted that pneumonia was more common in the risdiplam group versus the placebo group (7.5% versus 1.7%, respectively). The Committee noted that there were no adverse events leading to dose modifications.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.7 The Committee noted that in subgroup analysis that there was a treatment difference for all subgroups except for those in the 18-35 years age group which did not show any difference in MFM32 scores relative to placebo.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.8\u00a0The Committee noted unpublished updated 24-month results which indicated that motor function was stable or showed continued improvement during the second year of treatment with risdiplam, but the Committee considered that the treatment effect compared to placebo was not very large (results presented at the Muscular Dystrophy Association conference on March 15-18 2021. Oskoui et al. 2021). The Committee also noted that improvements in motor function were stable over 12 months in those who switched from placebo to risdiplam at 12 months. The Committee also noted that a decrease in adverse events was seen in the second year in both risdiplam, and those in the placebo group who switched to risdiplam.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">The Committee noted that 15% of randomised patients in SUNFISH did not contribute to the 24-month updated data, due to restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment effect of risdiplam in the SUNFISH group was smaller than that of the FIREFISH group. The Committee also noted that the effect of risdiplam does not seem to extend to those over the age of 18 years and considered that for this reason, if risdiplam were to be funded that initiation of treatment should be limited to those aged 18 years and under but advice should be sought from specialist clinicians regarding this criterion.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the use of risdiplam in types I, II and III (non-ambulant) SMA patients was of good-moderate quality, with good strength of evidence that risdiplam is superior to best supportive care, and non-inferior to nusinersen. The Committee considered that current evidence cannot be used to extrapolate long-term health gain from risdiplam for SMA patients as the data is not mature enough, but that duration of treatment effect is anticipated to be similar to nusinersen, based on current evidence. The Committee also considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted than types I, II, and III only are considered in this application, but that SUNFISH only included people with SMA type III if they were non-ambulant, and recent clinical advice has indicated that both those with SMA type III &lt;18 years of age and those who are pre-symptomatic will derive the greatest benefit from treatment. The Committee noted that less health benefit was observed in the 18\u201325-year-old subgroup in subgroup analyses provided for the SUNFISH trial.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing nusinersen with risdiplam, and considered this likely not ever changing in future. Informally, the Committee compared the nusinersen and risdiplam trials indirectly and considered that apparent effect appeared better with risdiplam than nusinersen, but noted that there were differences in the trials which meant that this indirect comparison would be confounded.\u00a0</p><p><b>General</b></p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that risdiplam and nusinersen are likely have a similar clinical effect, noting their similar mechanisms of actions, although that risdiplam may provide the benefit of treating systemic effects outside of the central nervous system. The Committee also considered that there are various benefits with oral treatment over intrathecal treatment, such as reduction in the risks associated with intrathecal administration, reduced hospital visits for patients, cultural preferences, and difficulty administering intrathecal injection in those with severe scoliosis or following scoliosis surgery.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Rare Disorders and Neurological Subcommittees discussed in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-03-05-Record-of-the-Rare-Disorders-and-Neurological-Subcommittee-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">March 2021</a> how there were currently no available direct comparisons of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittees noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, they considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar magnitude of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a study of the economic burden of SMA reported that the direct costs of SMA are greater than 50-fold higher compared with matched controls (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33224449/\" target=\"_blank\">Belter et al. J Mark Access Health Policy. 2020;8:1843277</a>). The Committee considered that while the economic burden of SMA is likely very high in New Zealand, it is unlikely that these results translate directly to a New Zealand context. The Committee noted a systematic review of the cost of illness of SMA that reported that the cost of SMA is high, but variable across countries (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576939/\" target=\"_blank\">Landfeldt et al. Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2021;19:501-20</a>). The Committee considered that while SMA treatment costs in Australia may be comparable in some ways to the New Zealand context, SMA patients in New Zealand are not placed on permanent ventilation and are more likely to only receive palliative care. The Committee noted that there is no evidence currently to indicate if the use of risdiplam (or nusinersen) will impact on or reduce the need for best supportive care for patients with SMA over the course of their life. The Committee noted that Pharmac economic modelling around the use of best supportive care was based on assumptions about patients\u2019 levels of need diminishing as morbidity decreased with treatment.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if risdiplam were funded in the New Zealand there may be a reduction in health sector costs associated with hospitalisations, need for ventilatory support, and gastrostomy placement, but that the cost of these would not be fully offset due to the current price of risdiplam.\u00a0</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in Australia the PBAC recommended risdiplam be funded for SMA types I, II and IIIa for those who are under 18 years of age at treatment initiation, if cost-minimised with nusinersen; and that the CADTH in Canada recommended funding of risdiplam, with various conditions.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application for consideration included SMA types I to III. While the evidence for type III was confined to the SUNFISH trial, which only included people who were non-ambulant with SMA type III, the Committee considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation. The Committee considered that Pharmac staff should seek advice from specialist clinicians on appropriate Special Authority access criteria, including which types of SMA should be included.</p>",
          "fs": "<p><b>Health need</b></p><p>1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the most common form of SMA is caused by a defect in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5, and that 94% of SMA patients have a deletion in exon 7. The Committee noted that the defect is an autosomal recessive deletion which causes an SMN protein deficiency leading to motor neuron degeneration and subsequent disease progression. The Committee also noted that the SMN2 gene adjacent to SMN1 also produces SMN protein, of which 10-15% is functional as most is truncated and rapidly degraded following translation. The Committee noted that individuals vary in the number of copies of SMN2, which can range from 0 to 8.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that classification of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is based on age of onset and maximal motor function achieved: pre-natal type 0 SMA patients achieve no motor function, are unable to sit or roll, and die within weeks of birth; infantile onset type I SMA patients present with symptoms at less than 6 months of age, are unable to sit or roll, and typically die within 2 years; childhood onset type II SMA patients present with symptoms at 6 to 18 months of age, can sit but are unable to walk independently, and survive to adulthood in 70% of cases; childhood onset type III SMA patients present with symptoms before age 3 (type IIIa), older then age 3 (type IIIb) or between 12 and 18 years of age (IIIc), can independently stand or walk but may lose the ability to walk over time, and have a normal lifespan; and adult onset type IV SMA patients present after age 18, have normal or mildly impaired motor function, and a normal lifespan.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients typically experience an acute phase of new onset of weakness, followed by a chronic phase of functional decline, and that the evolution from the acute to chronic phase depends on the SMA type. The Committee noted that SMA is the most common monogenic cause of infant mortality worldwide. The Committee noted that there is no funded treatment for SMA in New Zealand, and that best supportive care for SMA patients includes physiotherapy, nutritional support, respiratory support, orthopaedic support, and palliative care, all of which come as a significant cost to the health system and patients\u2019 families.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the health need for SMA type I patients is severe, as most do not live past the age of two years. The Committee also noted that SMA types II and III have a poor outlook in terms of mobility, independence, and quality of life; the majority of patients never walk or lose the ability to walk before reaching adolescence or adulthood. The Committee also noted that the lifetime probability of scoliosis surgery in type II SMA patients is approximately 80%, while SMA type IIIa has a risk of approximately 40%, which is strongly associated with the age of onset of loss of ambulation. The Committee noted than for SMA type IIIa, scoliosis surgery is needed in 71% of patients who lose the ability to walk before the age of 10, versus 22% in patients who lose the ability to talk after the age of 10 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164393/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Wijngaarde et al. Neurology. 2019;93:e149-e158</a>). The Committee noted that the major cause of morbidity and mortality in SMA patients is respiratory failure.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is also a high health need for family, wh\u0101nau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families and support systems. The Committee considered that only patients belonging to households with the financial means to relocate are able to make the choice to move overseas, and that those with more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. The Committee also noted that specialist clinicians have indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific SMA patients present later due to inequities in access to primary care, which must be considered in the context of access criteria relating to age of diagnosis. The Committee noted that there is a wider societal impact relating to SMA patients who move to adulthood due to different healthcare, educational and transport needs for these individuals.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were 74 SMA patients in New Zealand as at March 2019, 36 of whom were under the age of 18. The Committee noted that the point prevalence of SMA in New Zealand is 1.4 per 100,000, and therefore meets <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Pharmac\u2019s working definition for funding a \u2018rare disorder</a>\u2019 (1 per 50,000), and that the incidence is 0.8 per 10,000. The Committee noted that results from new-born screening programmes across nine international programmes reported an incidence of 0.78 per 10,000 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Dangouloff et al. Neuromuscular Discord. 2021;31:574-82</a>). The Committee noted that there is currently no screening programme for SMA in New Zealand and considered that if any SMA treatment were to be funded here, a screening programme would likely be rapidly implemented alongside this. The Committee noted that the carrier mutation frequency for SMA ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 90 people globally (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21811307/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Sugarman et al.

The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2020</a> and recommended nusinersen be funded with a high priority for both patient groups. The Committee noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally, thus only has an effect on the central nervous system.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that risdiplam is a small molecule that modulates SMN2 gene splicing, binding two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA, allowing full length SMN mRNA and protein to be synthesised and that systemic distribution has been demonstrated in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs in vivo. The Committee considered that this was significant as SMA is a multiorgan disease with cardiac, muscular, respiratory, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic effects. The Committee noted that risdiplam is not yet Medsafe approved for use in New Zealand, and that there is no FDA approval for use in children under two months of age as there is no safety data for this patient group.</p><p>Evidence</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of SMA depends on the number of SMN2 copies an individual patient has. The Committee noted that because risdiplam acts on the SMN2 protein, patients must have 2 or more copies of SMN2 to derive benefit from risdiplam. The Committee noted that risdiplam is a powder that must be mixed into a solution and administered orally once daily, while nusinersen is administered intrathecally 4-monthly (following loading doses). The Committee considered that oral administration may be more appropriate for patients who have undergone scoliosis surgery, as intrathecal administration may be difficult for these patients. The Committee considered however that adherence with very young children may be an issue, as babies often have reflux or vomit after feeding, but noted that this was not described in the clinical study data for risdiplam.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are four ongoing phase II clinical studies assessing the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in different SMA types: FIREFISH (SMA type I), SUNFISH (SMA types II and non-ambulant type III), JEWELFISH (SMA patients previously treated with other SMA agents), and RAINBOWFISH (genetically diagnosed, pre-symptomatic SMA patients). The Committee noted that only FIREFISH and SUNFISH are relevant to the current consideration for risdiplam. The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference variables for outcomes in these trials are mostly uncertain and unvalidated, with the exception of the Hammersmith Infant Neuromuscular Examination (HINE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be a one-point increase, and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be more than two points, however the Committee considered that patients and caregivers would likely still consider a one-point increase to be meaningful.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that FIREFISH is a level 2B phase II open-label, two-part study for those with SMA type I and a confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA with 2 or more SMN2 gene copies (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34320287/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Darras et al.

The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was a change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) total score at 12 months in relation to maximum score of 96, and that secondary endpoints were motor function, respiratory function, clinical global impression (which assesses the clinician\u2019s impression of a patients\u2019 mental health state) and patient/caregiver reported outcomes.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients enrolled represented a broad clinical range of SMA, with 71% of participants with SMA type II, and 29% with SMA type III who were non-ambulant; all had 2 to 4 copies of the <i>SMN2 </i>gene. The Committee also noted that the mean MFM32 total score at baseline was 46.11 with a range of 16.7 to 71.9.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.2 The Committee noted that 32% of participants had severe scoliosis at the time of enrolment, and 26% had scoliosis surgery prior to screening. The Committee noted that patients with severe scoliosis and prior scoliosis surgery were excluded from the CHERISH nusinersen study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019106/\" target=\"_blank\">Darras et al. Neurology. 2019;92:e2492-e2506</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.3 The Committee noted that the least squares mean change from baseline in MFM32 total score was 1.36 in the risdiplam group versus -0.19 in the placebo group, thus a treatment difference of 1.55 (95% CI 0.3 to 2.81; P=0.0156). The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference for MFM32 in SMA patients is unclear, but noted that in a congenital muscular dystrophy observational study the minimally clinically important difference in MFM32 score was 2.5 to 3.9 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166523/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Goff et al. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2021;102:604-10</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.4 The Committee noted that the proportion of individuals with a change of 3 or more points in MFM32 score was 38.3% in the risdiplam group and 23.7% in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 2.35 points (95% CI 1.01 to 5.44). The Committee also noted that respiratory function (as measured by a least squares mean change in baseline in the best percentage-predicted forced expiratory volume) was -5.16 in the risdiplam treatment group versus -3.11 in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of -2.05 (95% CI -6.67 to 2.56).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.5\u00a0The Committee noted that the proportion of individuals rated as \u2018improved\u2019 on the clinical global impression scale was 47.5% in the risdiplam group and 40% in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 1.38 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.47).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.6\u00a0The Committee noted that 20% of patients treated with risdiplam experienced at least one serious adverse event, versus 18.3% in the placebo group, and that there were no deaths. The Committee also noted that pneumonia was more common in the risdiplam group versus the placebo group (7.5% versus 1.7%, respectively). The Committee noted that there were no adverse events leading to dose modifications.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.7 The Committee noted that in subgroup analysis that there was a treatment difference for all subgroups except for those in the 18-35 years age group which did not show any difference in MFM32 scores relative to placebo.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.8\u00a0The Committee noted unpublished updated 24-month results which indicated that motor function was stable or showed continued improvement during the second year of treatment with risdiplam, but the Committee considered that the treatment effect compared to placebo was not very large (results presented at the Muscular Dystrophy Association conference on March 15-18 2021. Oskoui et al. 2021). The Committee also noted that improvements in motor function were stable over 12 months in those who switched from placebo to risdiplam at 12 months. The Committee also noted that a decrease in adverse events was seen in the second year in both risdiplam, and those in the placebo group who switched to risdiplam.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">The Committee noted that 15% of randomised patients in SUNFISH did not contribute to the 24-month updated data, due to restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment effect of risdiplam in the SUNFISH group was smaller than that of the FIREFISH group. The Committee also noted that the effect of risdiplam does not seem to extend to those over the age of 18 years and considered that for this reason, if risdiplam were to be funded that initiation of treatment should be limited to those aged 18 years and under but advice should be sought from specialist clinicians regarding this criterion.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the use of risdiplam in types I, II and III (non-ambulant) SMA patients was of good-moderate quality, with good strength of evidence that risdiplam is superior to best supportive care, and non-inferior to nusinersen. The Committee considered that current evidence cannot be used to extrapolate long-term health gain from risdiplam for SMA patients as the data is not mature enough, but that duration of treatment effect is anticipated to be similar to nusinersen, based on current evidence. The Committee also considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted than types I, II, and III only are considered in this application, but that SUNFISH only included people with SMA type III if they were non-ambulant, and recent clinical advice has indicated that both those with SMA type III &lt;18 years of age and those who are pre-symptomatic will derive the greatest benefit from treatment. The Committee noted that less health benefit was observed in the 18\u201325-year-old subgroup in subgroup analyses provided for the SUNFISH trial.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing nusinersen with risdiplam, and considered this likely not ever changing in future. Informally, the Committee compared the nusinersen and risdiplam trials indirectly and considered that apparent effect appeared better with risdiplam than nusinersen, but noted that there were differences in the trials which meant that this indirect comparison would be confounded.\u00a0</p><p><b>General</b></p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that risdiplam and nusinersen are likely have a similar clinical effect, noting their similar mechanisms of actions, although that risdiplam may provide the benefit of treating systemic effects outside of the central nervous system. The Committee also considered that there are various benefits with oral treatment over intrathecal treatment, such as reduction in the risks associated with intrathecal administration, reduced hospital visits for patients, cultural preferences, and difficulty administering intrathecal injection in those with severe scoliosis or following scoliosis surgery.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Rare Disorders and Neurological Subcommittees discussed in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-03-05-Record-of-the-Rare-Disorders-and-Neurological-Subcommittee-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">March 2021</a> how there were currently no available direct comparisons of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittees noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, they considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar magnitude of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a study of the economic burden of SMA reported that the direct costs of SMA are greater than 50-fold higher compared with matched controls (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33224449/\" target=\"_blank\">Belter et al. J Mark Access Health Policy. 2020;8:1843277</a>). The Committee considered that while the economic burden of SMA is likely very high in New Zealand, it is unlikely that these results translate directly to a New Zealand context. The Committee noted a systematic review of the cost of illness of SMA that reported that the cost of SMA is high, but variable across countries (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576939/\" target=\"_blank\">Landfeldt et al. Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2021;19:501-20</a>). The Committee considered that while SMA treatment costs in Australia may be comparable in some ways to the New Zealand context, SMA patients in New Zealand are not placed on permanent ventilation and are more likely to only receive palliative care. The Committee noted that there is no evidence currently to indicate if the use of risdiplam (or nusinersen) will impact on or reduce the need for best supportive care for patients with SMA over the course of their life. The Committee noted that Pharmac economic modelling around the use of best supportive care was based on assumptions about patients\u2019 levels of need diminishing as morbidity decreased with treatment.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if risdiplam were funded in the New Zealand there may be a reduction in health sector costs associated with hospitalisations, need for ventilatory support, and gastrostomy placement, but that the cost of these would not be fully offset due to the current price of risdiplam.\u00a0</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in Australia the PBAC recommended risdiplam be funded for SMA types I, II and IIIa for those who are under 18 years of age at treatment initiation, if cost-minimised with nusinersen; and that the CADTH in Canada recommended funding of risdiplam, with various conditions.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application for consideration included SMA types I to III. While the evidence for type III was confined to the SUNFISH trial, which only included people who were non-ambulant with SMA type III, the Committee considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation. The Committee considered that Pharmac staff should seek advice from specialist clinicians on appropriate Special Authority access criteria, including which types of SMA should be included.</p>",

The Committee also noted that there is stronger evidence for benefit in type I SMA than types II and III.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the SUNFISH trial investigated the use of risdiplam in non-ambulant type III SMA up to the age of 25 years, regardless of age of symptom onset.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p><b>Health need</b></p><p>1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the most common form of SMA is caused by a defect in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5, and that 94% of SMA patients have a deletion in exon 7. The Committee noted that the defect is an autosomal recessive deletion which causes an SMN protein deficiency leading to motor neuron degeneration and subsequent disease progression. The Committee also noted that the SMN2 gene adjacent to SMN1 also produces SMN protein, of which 10-15% is functional as most is truncated and rapidly degraded following translation. The Committee noted that individuals vary in the number of copies of SMN2, which can range from 0 to 8.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that classification of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is based on age of onset and maximal motor function achieved: pre-natal type 0 SMA patients achieve no motor function, are unable to sit or roll, and die within weeks of birth; infantile onset type I SMA patients present with symptoms at less than 6 months of age, are unable to sit or roll, and typically die within 2 years; childhood onset type II SMA patients present with symptoms at 6 to 18 months of age, can sit but are unable to walk independently, and survive to adulthood in 70% of cases; childhood onset type III SMA patients present with symptoms before age 3 (type IIIa), older then age 3 (type IIIb) or between 12 and 18 years of age (IIIc), can independently stand or walk but may lose the ability to walk over time, and have a normal lifespan; and adult onset type IV SMA patients present after age 18, have normal or mildly impaired motor function, and a normal lifespan.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients typically experience an acute phase of new onset of weakness, followed by a chronic phase of functional decline, and that the evolution from the acute to chronic phase depends on the SMA type. The Committee noted that SMA is the most common monogenic cause of infant mortality worldwide. The Committee noted that there is no funded treatment for SMA in New Zealand, and that best supportive care for SMA patients includes physiotherapy, nutritional support, respiratory support, orthopaedic support, and palliative care, all of which come as a significant cost to the health system and patients\u2019 families.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the health need for SMA type I patients is severe, as most do not live past the age of two years. The Committee also noted that SMA types II and III have a poor outlook in terms of mobility, independence, and quality of life; the majority of patients never walk or lose the ability to walk before reaching adolescence or adulthood. The Committee also noted that the lifetime probability of scoliosis surgery in type II SMA patients is approximately 80%, while SMA type IIIa has a risk of approximately 40%, which is strongly associated with the age of onset of loss of ambulation. The Committee noted than for SMA type IIIa, scoliosis surgery is needed in 71% of patients who lose the ability to walk before the age of 10, versus 22% in patients who lose the ability to talk after the age of 10 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164393/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Wijngaarde et al. Neurology. 2019;93:e149-e158</a>). The Committee noted that the major cause of morbidity and mortality in SMA patients is respiratory failure.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is also a high health need for family, wh\u0101nau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families and support systems. The Committee considered that only patients belonging to households with the financial means to relocate are able to make the choice to move overseas, and that those with more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. The Committee also noted that specialist clinicians have indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific SMA patients present later due to inequities in access to primary care, which must be considered in the context of access criteria relating to age of diagnosis. The Committee noted that there is a wider societal impact relating to SMA patients who move to adulthood due to different healthcare, educational and transport needs for these individuals.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were 74 SMA patients in New Zealand as at March 2019, 36 of whom were under the age of 18. The Committee noted that the point prevalence of SMA in New Zealand is 1.4 per 100,000, and therefore meets <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Pharmac\u2019s working definition for funding a \u2018rare disorder</a>\u2019 (1 per 50,000), and that the incidence is 0.8 per 10,000. The Committee noted that results from new-born screening programmes across nine international programmes reported an incidence of 0.78 per 10,000 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985857/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Dangouloff et al. Neuromuscular Discord. 2021;31:574-82</a>). The Committee noted that there is currently no screening programme for SMA in New Zealand and considered that if any SMA treatment were to be funded here, a screening programme would likely be rapidly implemented alongside this. The Committee noted that the carrier mutation frequency for SMA ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 90 people globally (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21811307/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Sugarman et al. Eur J Hum Genet. 2012;20:27-32</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/745211/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Pearn j. J Med Genet. 1978;15:409-13</a>).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a funding application for nusinersen, which is not currently funded in New Zealand, for the treatment of SMA was reviewed by the Rare Disorders Subcommittee (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorders-subcommittee-minutes-2018-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">November 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorder-subcommittee-record-nusinersen-for-spinal-muscular-atrophy-SMA-2019-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">September 2019</a>) where the application received a high priority recommendation for pre-symptomatic individuals with spinal muscular atrophy and two or three SMN2 copies, and a medium priority recommendation for symptomatic patients with type I, II, and IIIa spinal muscular atrophy. The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2020</a> and recommended nusinersen be funded with a high priority for both patient groups. The Committee noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally, thus only has an effect on the central nervous system.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that risdiplam is a small molecule that modulates SMN2 gene splicing, binding two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA, allowing full length SMN mRNA and protein to be synthesised and that systemic distribution has been demonstrated in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs in vivo. The Committee considered that this was significant as SMA is a multiorgan disease with cardiac, muscular, respiratory, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic effects. The Committee noted that risdiplam is not yet Medsafe approved for use in New Zealand, and that there is no FDA approval for use in children under two months of age as there is no safety data for this patient group.</p><p>Evidence</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of SMA depends on the number of SMN2 copies an individual patient has. The Committee noted that because risdiplam acts on the SMN2 protein, patients must have 2 or more copies of SMN2 to derive benefit from risdiplam. The Committee noted that risdiplam is a powder that must be mixed into a solution and administered orally once daily, while nusinersen is administered intrathecally 4-monthly (following loading doses). The Committee considered that oral administration may be more appropriate for patients who have undergone scoliosis surgery, as intrathecal administration may be difficult for these patients. The Committee considered however that adherence with very young children may be an issue, as babies often have reflux or vomit after feeding, but noted that this was not described in the clinical study data for risdiplam.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are four ongoing phase II clinical studies assessing the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in different SMA types: FIREFISH (SMA type I), SUNFISH (SMA types II and non-ambulant type III), JEWELFISH (SMA patients previously treated with other SMA agents), and RAINBOWFISH (genetically diagnosed, pre-symptomatic SMA patients). The Committee noted that only FIREFISH and SUNFISH are relevant to the current consideration for risdiplam. The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference variables for outcomes in these trials are mostly uncertain and unvalidated, with the exception of the Hammersmith Infant Neuromuscular Examination (HINE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be a one-point increase, and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE), for which a clinically important difference is considered to be more than two points, however the Committee considered that patients and caregivers would likely still consider a one-point increase to be meaningful.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that FIREFISH is a level 2B phase II open-label, two-part study for those with SMA type I and a confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA with 2 or more SMN2 gene copies (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34320287/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Darras et al.

The Committee noted that there were 180 participants enrolled in the trial, and that the median age at enrolment was nine years of age (range from 2 to 25 years). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was a change in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) total score at 12 months in relation to maximum score of 96, and that secondary endpoints were motor function, respiratory function, clinical global impression (which assesses the clinician\u2019s impression of a patients\u2019 mental health state) and patient/caregiver reported outcomes.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients enrolled represented a broad clinical range of SMA, with 71% of participants with SMA type II, and 29% with SMA type III who were non-ambulant; all had 2 to 4 copies of the <i>SMN2 </i>gene. The Committee also noted that the mean MFM32 total score at baseline was 46.11 with a range of 16.7 to 71.9.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.2 The Committee noted that 32% of participants had severe scoliosis at the time of enrolment, and 26% had scoliosis surgery prior to screening. The Committee noted that patients with severe scoliosis and prior scoliosis surgery were excluded from the CHERISH nusinersen study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019106/\" target=\"_blank\">Darras et al. Neurology. 2019;92:e2492-e2506</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.3 The Committee noted that the least squares mean change from baseline in MFM32 total score was 1.36 in the risdiplam group versus -0.19 in the placebo group, thus a treatment difference of 1.55 (95% CI 0.3 to 2.81; P=0.0156). The Committee considered that the minimal clinically important difference for MFM32 in SMA patients is unclear, but noted that in a congenital muscular dystrophy observational study the minimally clinically important difference in MFM32 score was 2.5 to 3.9 (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166523/\" target=\"_blank\">Le Goff et al. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2021;102:604-10</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.4 The Committee noted that the proportion of individuals with a change of 3 or more points in MFM32 score was 38.3% in the risdiplam group and 23.7% in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 2.35 points (95% CI 1.01 to 5.44). The Committee also noted that respiratory function (as measured by a least squares mean change in baseline in the best percentage-predicted forced expiratory volume) was -5.16 in the risdiplam treatment group versus -3.11 in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of -2.05 (95% CI -6.67 to 2.56).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.5\u00a0The Committee noted that the proportion of individuals rated as \u2018improved\u2019 on the clinical global impression scale was 47.5% in the risdiplam group and 40% in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 1.38 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.47).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.6\u00a0The Committee noted that 20% of patients treated with risdiplam experienced at least one serious adverse event, versus 18.3% in the placebo group, and that there were no deaths. The Committee also noted that pneumonia was more common in the risdiplam group versus the placebo group (7.5% versus 1.7%, respectively). The Committee noted that there were no adverse events leading to dose modifications.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.7 The Committee noted that in subgroup analysis that there was a treatment difference for all subgroups except for those in the 18-35 years age group which did not show any difference in MFM32 scores relative to placebo.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.12.8\u00a0The Committee noted unpublished updated 24-month results which indicated that motor function was stable or showed continued improvement during the second year of treatment with risdiplam, but the Committee considered that the treatment effect compared to placebo was not very large (results presented at the Muscular Dystrophy Association conference on March 15-18 2021. Oskoui et al. 2021). The Committee also noted that improvements in motor function were stable over 12 months in those who switched from placebo to risdiplam at 12 months. The Committee also noted that a decrease in adverse events was seen in the second year in both risdiplam, and those in the placebo group who switched to risdiplam.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">The Committee noted that 15% of randomised patients in SUNFISH did not contribute to the 24-month updated data, due to restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment effect of risdiplam in the SUNFISH group was smaller than that of the FIREFISH group. The Committee also noted that the effect of risdiplam does not seem to extend to those over the age of 18 years and considered that for this reason, if risdiplam were to be funded that initiation of treatment should be limited to those aged 18 years and under but advice should be sought from specialist clinicians regarding this criterion.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the use of risdiplam in types I, II and III (non-ambulant) SMA patients was of good-moderate quality, with good strength of evidence that risdiplam is superior to best supportive care, and non-inferior to nusinersen. The Committee considered that current evidence cannot be used to extrapolate long-term health gain from risdiplam for SMA patients as the data is not mature enough, but that duration of treatment effect is anticipated to be similar to nusinersen, based on current evidence. The Committee also considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted than types I, II, and III only are considered in this application, but that SUNFISH only included people with SMA type III if they were non-ambulant, and recent clinical advice has indicated that both those with SMA type III &lt;18 years of age and those who are pre-symptomatic will derive the greatest benefit from treatment. The Committee noted that less health benefit was observed in the 18\u201325-year-old subgroup in subgroup analyses provided for the SUNFISH trial.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing nusinersen with risdiplam, and considered this likely not ever changing in future. Informally, the Committee compared the nusinersen and risdiplam trials indirectly and considered that apparent effect appeared better with risdiplam than nusinersen, but noted that there were differences in the trials which meant that this indirect comparison would be confounded.\u00a0</p><p><b>General</b></p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that risdiplam and nusinersen are likely have a similar clinical effect, noting their similar mechanisms of actions, although that risdiplam may provide the benefit of treating systemic effects outside of the central nervous system. The Committee also considered that there are various benefits with oral treatment over intrathecal treatment, such as reduction in the risks associated with intrathecal administration, reduced hospital visits for patients, cultural preferences, and difficulty administering intrathecal injection in those with severe scoliosis or following scoliosis surgery.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Rare Disorders and Neurological Subcommittees discussed in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-03-05-Record-of-the-Rare-Disorders-and-Neurological-Subcommittee-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">March 2021</a> how there were currently no available direct comparisons of nusinersen and risdiplam for the treatment of Type 1 SMA. The Subcommittees noted that while small patient numbers make it difficult to accurately compare the two treatments, they considered that with currently available data, it would be reasonable to conclude that risdiplam demonstrates at least the same or similar magnitude of benefit compared with nusinersen in individuals with type 1 SMA, with no informal signals of inferiority (although formal testing for non-inferiority has not apparently been undertaken).</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a study of the economic burden of SMA reported that the direct costs of SMA are greater than 50-fold higher compared with matched controls (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33224449/\" target=\"_blank\">Belter et al. J Mark Access Health Policy. 2020;8:1843277</a>). The Committee considered that while the economic burden of SMA is likely very high in New Zealand, it is unlikely that these results translate directly to a New Zealand context. The Committee noted a systematic review of the cost of illness of SMA that reported that the cost of SMA is high, but variable across countries (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576939/\" target=\"_blank\">Landfeldt et al. Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2021;19:501-20</a>). The Committee considered that while SMA treatment costs in Australia may be comparable in some ways to the New Zealand context, SMA patients in New Zealand are not placed on permanent ventilation and are more likely to only receive palliative care. The Committee noted that there is no evidence currently to indicate if the use of risdiplam (or nusinersen) will impact on or reduce the need for best supportive care for patients with SMA over the course of their life. The Committee noted that Pharmac economic modelling around the use of best supportive care was based on assumptions about patients\u2019 levels of need diminishing as morbidity decreased with treatment.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if risdiplam were funded in the New Zealand there may be a reduction in health sector costs associated with hospitalisations, need for ventilatory support, and gastrostomy placement, but that the cost of these would not be fully offset due to the current price of risdiplam.\u00a0</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in Australia the PBAC recommended risdiplam be funded for SMA types I, II and IIIa for those who are under 18 years of age at treatment initiation, if cost-minimised with nusinersen; and that the CADTH in Canada recommended funding of risdiplam, with various conditions.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application for consideration included SMA types I to III. While the evidence for type III was confined to the SUNFISH trial, which only included people who were non-ambulant with SMA type III, the Committee considered that the results from SUNFISH are likely generalisable to ambulant type SMA patients, though there is limited evidence to support this. The Committee considered that treatment should be started as early as possible to prevent or reduce the loss of ambulation. The Committee considered that Pharmac staff should seek advice from specialist clinicians on appropriate Special Authority access criteria, including which types of SMA should be included.</p>",

The Committee noted that this a complex area with limited evidence to inform economic modelling.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that its views on the degree of treatment benefit associated with medicines in this area have been chronicled in previous meeting records, and informed by published evidence and New Zealand clinical expert advice. Consequently, the scope of this discussion was limited to the duration of that treatment benefit.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>To determine the appropriate duration of treatment effect, the Committee considered evidence relating to:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.3.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the mechanism of action of medicines in this disease area,</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.3.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the duration of clinical evidence for the two medicines, and</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.3.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the strength of clinical evidence, including relationships between surrogate and final endpoints in this disease area and degree of evidenced treatment effect.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are two medicines currently under consideration for the treatment of SMA in New Zealand, nusinersen and risdiplam. The Committee noted that nusinersen and risdiplam have very similar mechanisms of action, and that there is high biological plausibility of an enduring treatment effect based on these mechanisms of action.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that currently nusinersen has longer-term follow up than risdiplam: the maximum length of results reported from phase three clinical trials are approximately 39 months for nusinersen and 24 months for risdiplam. The Committee considered that this length of evidence is relatively short for a life-long condition, and that the survival data in the clinical trials is extremely immature.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>However, the Committee also noted that the survival and progression free survival outcomes, in SMA type 1 especially, show substantial improvements relative to the natural history of disease.
