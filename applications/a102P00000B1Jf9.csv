Typical histological features include acanthosis, parakeratosis, dilated blood vessels and a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate.\xa0Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 80-90%).

The Subcommittee noted that there are currently 4 biologic treatments funded for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in New Zealand: the 3 TNF-α inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab. The Subcommittee noted that there are no funded IL-22 or IL-23 inhibitors available for the treatment of psoriasis. The Subcommittee considered that, although funded for this indication, infliximab is not the drug of choice for most clinicians as it requires a day stay infusion centre and incurs a significant cost in time and money to both patients and the health sector. The Subcommittee also considered that etanercept is less commonly used than adalimumab, as it is less efficacious than the other funded biologic agents and it requires weekly administration. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence for a decrease in the efficacy of biologics over time; a 2018 study by Egeberg et al reported that 30-60% of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients using biologics had discontinued treatment at 75 months due to loss of efficacy, with secukinumab having the lowest drug-survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094341/"" target=""_blank"">Egeberg et al.

The Subcommittee noted that there are currently 4 biologic treatments funded for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in New Zealand: the 3 TNF-α inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab. The Subcommittee noted that there are no funded IL-22 or IL-23 inhibitors available for the treatment of psoriasis. The Subcommittee considered that, although funded for this indication, infliximab is not the drug of choice for most clinicians as it requires a day stay infusion centre and incurs a significant cost in time and money to both patients and the health sector.

The Committee noted that by body surface area score, moderate to very severe psoriasis was associated with poorer outcomes for the ‘impairment while working’ and ‘daily activities impaired’ WPAI domains (all p&lt;0.05 vs mild psoriasis), and very severe psoriasis was associated with increased ‘work hours missed’ and ‘work hours affected’ (both p&lt;0.05 vs mild psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a study of how family and whānau caring for patients with psoriasis are affected (Martínez-García.

The Committee noted that the presence of psoriasis impaired the quality of life of 87.8% of cohabitants; Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) scores were significantly associated with DLQI scores of patients (correlation coefficient = 0.554; P&lt;001). The Committee also noted that anxiety and depression levels did not differ between patients and family but were significantly higher than control patients and their families (P&lt;001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that currently patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis are treated with phototherapy, acitretin, methotrexate and/or ciclosporin and that under current Special Authority access criteria, patients must have tried, but had an inadequate response to, be contraindicated to, or experienced intolerable side effects from, at least three of these treatments, prior to biologic treatment. The Committee also noted that both methotrexate and ciclosporin are currently funded without restriction, while acitretin has Special Authority restrictions in place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and secukinumab are the currently funded biologics for severe chronic plaque psoriasis, subject to restrictions. The Committee noted that adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are anti TNF-α therapies, while secukinumab is an anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17) therapy. The Committee noted that anti-IL12/23 therapies can also be used as biologic treatment for psoriasis, but that there are currently no funded options in New Zealand. The Committee considered there would be benefit in funding another anti-IL biologic and considered the potential for a competitive process to fund another biologic treatment line for psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a clinical review of the evidence for adalimumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis conducted by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH; Peprah &amp; Aragez. Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020). The Committee noted that the CADTH considered that there was consistent evidence that adalimumab was less effective than infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, and secukinumab in achieving skin clearance and improvements in health-related quality of life in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the treatment landscape for psoriasis has changed markedly in recent years and considered that this was likely influenced by marketing strategies for new biologics by pharmaceutical companies.

The Committee noted that IL-17 inhibitors achieved 41.4% to 67.5% PASI 100 response at 1 year, and IL-12/23 treatment achieved PASI 100 in 41.8%/56.3% at 1 year (Romero et al. J Dermatolog Treat. 2021;1-9), although this comparison was indirect.\xa0</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a supplier-funded systematic review and meta-analysis assessing whether greater improvement in PASI scores from PASI 75-89 to PASI 90 is associated with greater quality of life improvements, specifically DLQI scores (Puig et al. J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2017;31:213-20). The Committee noted that the change from baseline in DLQI was 78% in PASI 75–89 responders (95%CI 75% to 82%) and was 90% for PASI 90 responders (95% CI 88% to 93%), implying perhaps a 12% greater improvement in DLQI score for PASI 90 compared with PASI 75–89. The Committee noted that the same meta-analysis also reported a clinically significant difference in DLQI score of 0/1 between PASI 75-89 and PASI 90 responders (45%, 95% CI 41.05 to 50.0% vs 73%, 95% CI 70.0% to 76.0%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted the meta-analysis used different trials, settings and treatments across the PASI metrics, but considered PASI 90 to be clinically meaningfully better than PASI 75.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex, which inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are over 25 indirect comparison network meta-analyses for treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, including a Cochrane living systematic review (Sbidian et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021;4:CD011535) which reported risankizumab as the third best treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, behind infliximab (funded in New Zealand) and ixekizumab (an IL-17 inhibitor not funded in New Zealand).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there have been several head-to-head direct comparator studies comparing risankizumab with adalimumab, ustekinumb, secukinumab, or placebo:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Reich et al.

PASI90 at week 16 in the UltIMMa-1 trial reported an adjusted difference of 33.5% between risankizumab and ustekinumb (95% CI 22.7 to 44.3, p&lt;0.0001), and a 70.3% adjusted difference between risankizumab and placebo (95% CI 64.0 to 76.7, p&lt;0.0001) PASI90 at week 16 for UltIMMa-2 reported an adjusted difference between risankizumab and ustekinumab of 27.6% (95% CI16.7 to 38.5, p&lt;0.0001), and an adjusted difference of 72.5% (95% CI 66.8 to 78.2) for risankizumab compared to placebo.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Blauvelt et al.

The Committee noted that IL-17 inhibitors (brodalumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab and risankizumab), and infliximab were reported as being the most efficacious biologic treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an indirect comparison network meta-analysis for the comparison of efficacy and safety of IL-23 targeted drugs (ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (Shi et al. Dermatol Ther. 2020;33:e13802). The Committee noted that 90 and 180 mg risankizumab were reported to be more effective than tildrakizumab (5, 25, 100, and 200 mg), ustekinumab (45 mg, 90 mg, body weight-based administration), guselkumab 100 mg and risankizumab at doses of 75 and 150 mg. The Committee noted that 90 mg risankizumab has the best efficacy index for PASI75, while 180 mg risankizumab ranked first in PASI90. The Committee also noted that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events between drugs targeting IL-23 and placebo. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an additional indirect comparison network meta-analysis of 71 randomised controlled trials of the short-term and long-term comparative efficacy of biologic and oral treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Armstrong et al. Dermatol Ther (Heidelb); 2021; online ahead of print). The Committee noted that the PASI 90 response rates were highest for ixekizumab, risankizumab, and brodalumab, which were significantly higher than those for guselkumab, secukinumab, infliximab, certolizumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, tildrakizumab, etanercept, apremilast, and dimethyl fumarate. The Committee also noted that The PASI 100 response rates were highest for ixekizumab (41.4%), risankizumab (40.8%), and brodalumab (40.3%). </p><p><br></p><p>In considering the above network meta-analyses of efficacy, the Committee both reiterated and emphasised what it considered to be the inherent limitations and lesser quality of such indirect comparison methods generically, when compared with direct comparisons. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis to be of high strength and quality. The Committee also considered that the evidence suggests that risankizumab has similar or higher efficacy to other biologic treatments, is substantially better at achieving a PASI90 score than adalimumab and is incrementally superior to secukinumab in achieving a PASI90, especially when compared directly in the several head-to-head RCTs noted earlier. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee note that risankizumab is formulated in a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection and could therefore be dispensed in the community for selfadministration at home. The Committee noted that risankizumab is administered at week 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter for maintenance, which the Committee considered to be a more suitable dosing schedule than other biologic treatments: 52 injections a year with etanercept, 26 per year with adalimumab, 12 per year with secukinumab, and 7 infusions per year for infliximab. The Committee also noted that there are significant access issues with infliximab given it is administered as an infusion. The Committee highlighted this is exacerbated in dermatological indications as many patients receive care from private specialists who do not have the infusion facilities to administer infliximab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited data on the long-term effectiveness of risankizumab, and that it is unclear if prior treatment with risankizumab would influence the efficacy of biologics in a later line of treatment if should risankizumab fail. The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded, it may be more beneficial as a secondline treatment as there is proven efficacy of risankizumab following other biologics, but limited evidence for the inverse scenario. The Committee considered that it would be clinically useful to have a biologic with a different mechanism of action to the currently funded treatment options, so that clinicians have a broader range of treatment options. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in an assessment from Japan, risankizumab was expected to provide 0.30–0.89 additional QALYs versus comparator biologics, and based on typical willingness-to-pay benchmarks for Japan was considered cost-effective versus other biologics (Saeki et al. J Dermatolog Treat. 2020;1-11). The Committee considered that market dynamics and potential uptake of risankizumab are difficult to predict without more information regarding long-term drug efficacy and if the efficacy of other biologics changes if given after treatment with risankizumab. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that the efficacy of adalimumab after risankizumab failure is likely to be lower than the efficacy of adalimumab in a first-line setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that risankizumab may not be the first-choice agent in psoriasis patients who have significant psoriatic arthritis (approximately 15%), as there is limited evidence demonstrating the benefit of risankizumab in arthritis. The Committee considered this may change as evidence for risankizumab in this setting evolves. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded as only a second-line option, that between 35 and 50% of biologic eligible patients over 4-5 years would switch to risankizumab following failure of first-line biologic treatment, usually with adalimumab or secukinumab. The Committee also considered that, if risankizumab were to be funded for any line of treatment, 25-40% of new biologic eligible patients would use risankizumab as 1st line biologic, and a total of 50% of biologic eligible patients would be using risankizumab, regardless of treatment line, after four or five years. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that a small number of patients who experience primary treatment failure require hospitalisation, which may be as long as three weeks. The Committee considered infliximab is also used in some cases of treatment failure, and that risankizumab could reduce hospitalisation and infliximab use, which would be of benefit to the health system. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that adalimumab and secukinumab are the most commonly administered first-line biologics in psoriasis. The Committee considered that UV light therapy would not be an appropriate comparator, due to lower PASI 75 responses, as well as the potential damage to the skin and it being a very time intensive treatment which would not be suitable for many patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for risankizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for chronic and severe plaque psoriasis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000005oh2h&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001VAPM"" alt=""image.png""></img></p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p>\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee noted that this application had previously been reviewed by the Dermatology Subcommittee in November 2020, where risankizumab received a high recommendation for both first- and second-line treatment chronic plaque psoriasis.

The Committee noted that by body surface area score, moderate to very severe psoriasis was associated with poorer outcomes for the ‘impairment while working’ and ‘daily activities impaired’ WPAI domains (all p&lt;0.05 vs mild psoriasis), and very severe psoriasis was associated with increased ‘work hours missed’ and ‘work hours affected’ (both p&lt;0.05 vs mild psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a study of how family and whānau caring for patients with psoriasis are affected (Martínez-García. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2014;71:302-7). The Committee noted that the presence of psoriasis impaired the quality of life of 87.8% of cohabitants; Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) scores were significantly associated with DLQI scores of patients (correlation coefficient = 0.554; P&lt;001). The Committee also noted that anxiety and depression levels did not differ between patients and family but were significantly higher than control patients and their families (P&lt;001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that currently patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis are treated with phototherapy, acitretin, methotrexate and/or ciclosporin and that under current Special Authority access criteria, patients must have tried, but had an inadequate response to, be contraindicated to, or experienced intolerable side effects from, at least three of these treatments, prior to biologic treatment. The Committee also noted that both methotrexate and ciclosporin are currently funded without restriction, while acitretin has Special Authority restrictions in place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and secukinumab are the currently funded biologics for severe chronic plaque psoriasis, subject to restrictions. The Committee noted that adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are anti TNF-α therapies, while secukinumab is an anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17) therapy. The Committee noted that anti-IL12/23 therapies can also be used as biologic treatment for psoriasis, but that there are currently no funded options in New Zealand. The Committee considered there would be benefit in funding another anti-IL biologic and considered the potential for a competitive process to fund another biologic treatment line for psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a clinical review of the evidence for adalimumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis conducted by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH; Peprah &amp; Aragez. Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020). The Committee noted that the CADTH considered that there was consistent evidence that adalimumab was less effective than infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, and secukinumab in achieving skin clearance and improvements in health-related quality of life in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the treatment landscape for psoriasis has changed markedly in recent years and considered that this was likely influenced by marketing strategies for new biologics by pharmaceutical companies. The Committee considered that one such change is the treatment target of PASI 75 to PASI 90 and considered that this will eventually move to PASI 100.</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Committee was made aware of the PSO-BIO-REAL study, a non-interventional observational study that reported, in a real-world setting of 836 patients treated with biologic therapy, that there were marked differences in patient reported outcomes for stinging, flaking, pain, itching, burning, redness, and cracking skin when psoriasis response improved from PASI 75 to PASI 90 and then PASI 100 (Lacour et al. Dermatol Ther (Heidelb). 2020;10:1099-109).</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Committee also was made aware of a systematic review of 66 studies investigating PASI 100 response and noted that PASI 100 was more likely to be achieved with biologic treatments compared to methotrexate. The Committee noted that IL-17 inhibitors achieved 41.4% to 67.5% PASI 100 response at 1 year, and IL-12/23 treatment achieved PASI 100 in 41.8%/56.3% at 1 year (Romero et al. J Dermatolog Treat. 2021;1-9), although this comparison was indirect.\xa0</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a supplier-funded systematic review and meta-analysis assessing whether greater improvement in PASI scores from PASI 75-89 to PASI 90 is associated with greater quality of life improvements, specifically DLQI scores (Puig et al. J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2017;31:213-20). The Committee noted that the change from baseline in DLQI was 78% in PASI 75–89 responders (95%CI 75% to 82%) and was 90% for PASI 90 responders (95% CI 88% to 93%), implying perhaps a 12% greater improvement in DLQI score for PASI 90 compared with PASI 75–89. The Committee noted that the same meta-analysis also reported a clinically significant difference in DLQI score of 0/1 between PASI 75-89 and PASI 90 responders (45%, 95% CI 41.05 to 50.0% vs 73%, 95% CI 70.0% to 76.0%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted the meta-analysis used different trials, settings and treatments across the PASI metrics, but considered PASI 90 to be clinically meaningfully better than PASI 75.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex, which inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are over 25 indirect comparison network meta-analyses for treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, including a Cochrane living systematic review (Sbidian et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021;4:CD011535) which reported risankizumab as the third best treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, behind infliximab (funded in New Zealand) and ixekizumab (an IL-17 inhibitor not funded in New Zealand).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there have been several head-to-head direct comparator studies comparing risankizumab with adalimumab, ustekinumb, secukinumab, or placebo:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Reich et al.

PASI90 at week 16 in the UltIMMa-1 trial reported an adjusted difference of 33.5% between risankizumab and ustekinumb (95% CI 22.7 to 44.3, p&lt;0.0001), and a 70.3% adjusted difference between risankizumab and placebo (95% CI 64.0 to 76.7, p&lt;0.0001) PASI90 at week 16 for UltIMMa-2 reported an adjusted difference between risankizumab and ustekinumab of 27.6% (95% CI16.7 to 38.5, p&lt;0.0001), and an adjusted difference of 72.5% (95% CI 66.8 to 78.2) for risankizumab compared to placebo.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Blauvelt et al.

Risankizumab was noninferior to secukinumab in the proportion of patients achieving PASI90 at week 16 (73·8% vs. 65·6%; difference of 8·2%, 96·25% CI -2·2 to 18·6) and superior to secukinumab at week 52 (86·6% vs. 57·1%; difference of 29·8%, 95% CI 20·8 to 38·8; P &lt; 0·001.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a systematic review of 25 indirect comparison network meta-analyses of at least two biologics for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Wright et al. 2021). The Committee noted that IL-17 inhibitors (brodalumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab and risankizumab), and infliximab were reported as being the most efficacious biologic treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an indirect comparison network meta-analysis for the comparison of efficacy and safety of IL-23 targeted drugs (ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (Shi et al. Dermatol Ther. 2020;33:e13802). The Committee noted that 90 and 180 mg risankizumab were reported to be more effective than tildrakizumab (5, 25, 100, and 200 mg), ustekinumab (45 mg, 90 mg, body weight-based administration), guselkumab 100 mg and risankizumab at doses of 75 and 150 mg. The Committee noted that 90 mg risankizumab has the best efficacy index for PASI75, while 180 mg risankizumab ranked first in PASI90. The Committee also noted that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events between drugs targeting IL-23 and placebo. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an additional indirect comparison network meta-analysis of 71 randomised controlled trials of the short-term and long-term comparative efficacy of biologic and oral treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Armstrong et al. Dermatol Ther (Heidelb); 2021; online ahead of print). The Committee noted that the PASI 90 response rates were highest for ixekizumab, risankizumab, and brodalumab, which were significantly higher than those for guselkumab, secukinumab, infliximab, certolizumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, tildrakizumab, etanercept, apremilast, and dimethyl fumarate. The Committee also noted that The PASI 100 response rates were highest for ixekizumab (41.4%), risankizumab (40.8%), and brodalumab (40.3%). </p><p><br></p><p>In considering the above network meta-analyses of efficacy, the Committee both reiterated and emphasised what it considered to be the inherent limitations and lesser quality of such indirect comparison methods generically, when compared with direct comparisons. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis to be of high strength and quality. The Committee also considered that the evidence suggests that risankizumab has similar or higher efficacy to other biologic treatments, is substantially better at achieving a PASI90 score than adalimumab and is incrementally superior to secukinumab in achieving a PASI90, especially when compared directly in the several head-to-head RCTs noted earlier. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee note that risankizumab is formulated in a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection and could therefore be dispensed in the community for selfadministration at home. The Committee noted that risankizumab is administered at week 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter for maintenance, which the Committee considered to be a more suitable dosing schedule than other biologic treatments: 52 injections a year with etanercept, 26 per year with adalimumab, 12 per year with secukinumab, and 7 infusions per year for infliximab. The Committee also noted that there are significant access issues with infliximab given it is administered as an infusion. The Committee highlighted this is exacerbated in dermatological indications as many patients receive care from private specialists who do not have the infusion facilities to administer infliximab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited data on the long-term effectiveness of risankizumab, and that it is unclear if prior treatment with risankizumab would influence the efficacy of biologics in a later line of treatment if should risankizumab fail. The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded, it may be more beneficial as a secondline treatment as there is proven efficacy of risankizumab following other biologics, but limited evidence for the inverse scenario. The Committee considered that it would be clinically useful to have a biologic with a different mechanism of action to the currently funded treatment options, so that clinicians have a broader range of treatment options. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in an assessment from Japan, risankizumab was expected to provide 0.30–0.89 additional QALYs versus comparator biologics, and based on typical willingness-to-pay benchmarks for Japan was considered cost-effective versus other biologics (Saeki et al. J Dermatolog Treat. 2020;1-11). The Committee considered that market dynamics and potential uptake of risankizumab are difficult to predict without more information regarding long-term drug efficacy and if the efficacy of other biologics changes if given after treatment with risankizumab. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that the efficacy of adalimumab after risankizumab failure is likely to be lower than the efficacy of adalimumab in a first-line setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that risankizumab may not be the first-choice agent in psoriasis patients who have significant psoriatic arthritis (approximately 15%), as there is limited evidence demonstrating the benefit of risankizumab in arthritis. The Committee considered this may change as evidence for risankizumab in this setting evolves. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded as only a second-line option, that between 35 and 50% of biologic eligible patients over 4-5 years would switch to risankizumab following failure of first-line biologic treatment, usually with adalimumab or secukinumab. The Committee also considered that, if risankizumab were to be funded for any line of treatment, 25-40% of new biologic eligible patients would use risankizumab as 1st line biologic, and a total of 50% of biologic eligible patients would be using risankizumab, regardless of treatment line, after four or five years. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that a small number of patients who experience primary treatment failure require hospitalisation, which may be as long as three weeks. The Committee considered infliximab is also used in some cases of treatment failure, and that risankizumab could reduce hospitalisation and infliximab use, which would be of benefit to the health system. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that adalimumab and secukinumab are the most commonly administered first-line biologics in psoriasis. The Committee considered that UV light therapy would not be an appropriate comparator, due to lower PASI 75 responses, as well as the potential damage to the skin and it being a very time intensive treatment which would not be suitable for many patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for risankizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for chronic and severe plaque psoriasis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000005oh2h&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001VAPM"" alt=""image.png""></img></p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p>\xa0</p>', 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': '<p>The Committee reviewed the application for risankizumab in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis (1st and 2nd line biologic treatment).\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee reviewed the application for risankizumab in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis (1st and 2nd line biologic treatment).\xa0</p>', 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': 'High', 'fs': 'High', 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC minutes</a></p>', 'fs': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC minutes</a></p>', 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Aug 2021', 'fs': 'Aug 2021', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Clinical advice received from Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC) at meeting Friday 21 May 2021.', 'fs': 'Clinical advice received from Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC) at meeting Friday 21 May 2021.', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0P2P000005oh2hUAA'}, 'Id': 'a0P2P000005oh2hUAA', 'Event_Date__c': '2021-08-06', 'Event_Description__c': 'Clinical advice received from Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC) at meeting Friday 21 May 2021.', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Links__c': '<p><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC minutes</a></p>', 'Outcome__c': 'High', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Aug 2021', 'Published_Recommendation__c': '<p>The Committee recommended that risankizumab for the second line treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis be listed with a high priority subject to the following Special Authority criteria:</p><p><br></p><p>Initial application – (severe chronic plaque psoriasis, second line biologic) only from a dermatologist.

The Committee also noted that psoriasis has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a chronic, painful, disfiguring, and disabling disease for which there is no cure and with significant impairment in quality of life, and that the WHO has recognised psoriasis as a serious noncommunicable disease, highlighting that many people in the world suffer needlessly from psoriasis due to delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment options, insufficient access to care, and because of social stigmatisation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that severe chronic plaque psoriasis is defined as having a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score of &gt;10 and/or a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of &gt;10.

Patient Relat Outcome Meas. 2015;6:167-77). The Committee was made aware of a systematic review and meta-analysis of health state utility value calculated from EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L for psoriasis as a general condition, for plaque psoriasis, and for psoriatic arthritis (the values being 0.748 (0.718, 0.777; 98.8%), 0.755 (0.727, 0.783; 98.6%), and 0.585 (0.538, 0.632; 98.2%), respectively; Yang Z, et al.

The Committee noted that the change from baseline in DLQI was 78% in PASI 75–89 responders (95%CI 75% to 82%) and was 90% for PASI 90 responders (95% CI 88% to 93%), implying perhaps a 12% greater improvement in DLQI score for PASI 90 compared with PASI 75–89. The Committee noted that the same meta-analysis also reported a clinically significant difference in DLQI score of 0/1 between PASI 75-89 and PASI 90 responders (45%, 95% CI 41.05 to 50.0% vs 73%, 95% CI 70.0% to 76.0%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted the meta-analysis used different trials, settings and treatments across the PASI metrics, but considered PASI 90 to be clinically meaningfully better than PASI 75.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex, which inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are over 25 indirect comparison network meta-analyses for treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, including a Cochrane living systematic review (Sbidian et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021;4:CD011535) which reported risankizumab as the third best treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, behind infliximab (funded in New Zealand) and ixekizumab (an IL-17 inhibitor not funded in New Zealand).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there have been several head-to-head direct comparator studies comparing risankizumab with adalimumab, ustekinumb, secukinumab, or placebo:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Reich et al.

PASI90 at week 16 in the UltIMMa-1 trial reported an adjusted difference of 33.5% between risankizumab and ustekinumb (95% CI 22.7 to 44.3, p&lt;0.0001), and a 70.3% adjusted difference between risankizumab and placebo (95% CI 64.0 to 76.7, p&lt;0.0001) PASI90 at week 16 for UltIMMa-2 reported an adjusted difference between risankizumab and ustekinumab of 27.6% (95% CI16.7 to 38.5, p&lt;0.0001), and an adjusted difference of 72.5% (95% CI 66.8 to 78.2) for risankizumab compared to placebo.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Blauvelt et al.

Risankizumab was noninferior to secukinumab in the proportion of patients achieving PASI90 at week 16 (73·8% vs. 65·6%; difference of 8·2%, 96·25% CI -2·2 to 18·6) and superior to secukinumab at week 52 (86·6% vs. 57·1%; difference of 29·8%, 95% CI 20·8 to 38·8; P &lt; 0·001.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of a systematic review of 25 indirect comparison network meta-analyses of at least two biologics for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Wright et al. 2021). The Committee noted that IL-17 inhibitors (brodalumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab and risankizumab), and infliximab were reported as being the most efficacious biologic treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an indirect comparison network meta-analysis for the comparison of efficacy and safety of IL-23 targeted drugs (ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (Shi et al. Dermatol Ther. 2020;33:e13802). The Committee noted that 90 and 180 mg risankizumab were reported to be more effective than tildrakizumab (5, 25, 100, and 200 mg), ustekinumab (45 mg, 90 mg, body weight-based administration), guselkumab 100 mg and risankizumab at doses of 75 and 150 mg. The Committee noted that 90 mg risankizumab has the best efficacy index for PASI75, while 180 mg risankizumab ranked first in PASI90. The Committee also noted that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events between drugs targeting IL-23 and placebo. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee was made aware of an additional indirect comparison network meta-analysis of 71 randomised controlled trials of the short-term and long-term comparative efficacy of biologic and oral treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Armstrong et al. Dermatol Ther (Heidelb); 2021; online ahead of print). The Committee noted that the PASI 90 response rates were highest for ixekizumab, risankizumab, and brodalumab, which were significantly higher than those for guselkumab, secukinumab, infliximab, certolizumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, tildrakizumab, etanercept, apremilast, and dimethyl fumarate. The Committee also noted that The PASI 100 response rates were highest for ixekizumab (41.4%), risankizumab (40.8%), and brodalumab (40.3%). </p><p><br></p><p>In considering the above network meta-analyses of efficacy, the Committee both reiterated and emphasised what it considered to be the inherent limitations and lesser quality of such indirect comparison methods generically, when compared with direct comparisons. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis to be of high strength and quality. The Committee also considered that the evidence suggests that risankizumab has similar or higher efficacy to other biologic treatments, is substantially better at achieving a PASI90 score than adalimumab and is incrementally superior to secukinumab in achieving a PASI90, especially when compared directly in the several head-to-head RCTs noted earlier. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee note that risankizumab is formulated in a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection and could therefore be dispensed in the community for selfadministration at home. The Committee noted that risankizumab is administered at week 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter for maintenance, which the Committee considered to be a more suitable dosing schedule than other biologic treatments: 52 injections a year with etanercept, 26 per year with adalimumab, 12 per year with secukinumab, and 7 infusions per year for infliximab. The Committee also noted that there are significant access issues with infliximab given it is administered as an infusion. The Committee highlighted this is exacerbated in dermatological indications as many patients receive care from private specialists who do not have the infusion facilities to administer infliximab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited data on the long-term effectiveness of risankizumab, and that it is unclear if prior treatment with risankizumab would influence the efficacy of biologics in a later line of treatment if should risankizumab fail. The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded, it may be more beneficial as a secondline treatment as there is proven efficacy of risankizumab following other biologics, but limited evidence for the inverse scenario. The Committee considered that it would be clinically useful to have a biologic with a different mechanism of action to the currently funded treatment options, so that clinicians have a broader range of treatment options. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in an assessment from Japan, risankizumab was expected to provide 0.30–0.89 additional QALYs versus comparator biologics, and based on typical willingness-to-pay benchmarks for Japan was considered cost-effective versus other biologics (Saeki et al. J Dermatolog Treat. 2020;1-11). The Committee considered that market dynamics and potential uptake of risankizumab are difficult to predict without more information regarding long-term drug efficacy and if the efficacy of other biologics changes if given after treatment with risankizumab. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that the efficacy of adalimumab after risankizumab failure is likely to be lower than the efficacy of adalimumab in a first-line setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that risankizumab may not be the first-choice agent in psoriasis patients who have significant psoriatic arthritis (approximately 15%), as there is limited evidence demonstrating the benefit of risankizumab in arthritis. The Committee considered this may change as evidence for risankizumab in this setting evolves. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that if risankizumab were to be funded as only a second-line option, that between 35 and 50% of biologic eligible patients over 4-5 years would switch to risankizumab following failure of first-line biologic treatment, usually with adalimumab or secukinumab. The Committee also considered that, if risankizumab were to be funded for any line of treatment, 25-40% of new biologic eligible patients would use risankizumab as 1st line biologic, and a total of 50% of biologic eligible patients would be using risankizumab, regardless of treatment line, after four or five years. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that a small number of patients who experience primary treatment failure require hospitalisation, which may be as long as three weeks. The Committee considered infliximab is also used in some cases of treatment failure, and that risankizumab could reduce hospitalisation and infliximab use, which would be of benefit to the health system. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that adalimumab and secukinumab are the most commonly administered first-line biologics in psoriasis. The Committee considered that UV light therapy would not be an appropriate comparator, due to lower PASI 75 responses, as well as the potential damage to the skin and it being a very time intensive treatment which would not be suitable for many patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for risankizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for chronic and severe plaque psoriasis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
