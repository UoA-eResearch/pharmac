The Subcommittee noted that the onset of AML is usually rapid, with presentation and diagnosis occurring within weeks of the onset of symptoms (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17126723/"" target=""_blank"">Estey E &amp; Döhner H.

The Subcommittee noted that the majority of patients present with complications of pancytopenia (low counts for all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and bone marrow failure such as anaemia (e.g. fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches, pale skin, or shortness of breath), thrombocytopenia (e.g. bruising, excess bleeding such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds) and neutropenia (e.g. persistent and recurrent infections often accompanied with fever) or the clinical consequences of leukostasis due to an extremely high white blood cell count (e.g., difficulty breathing, confusion, and decreased consciousness).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted evidence reporting that Māori have an increased risk of AML (risk ratio 1.5 in the age group 25-49 and risk ratio 1.3 in the age group 50-74), relative to New Zealand Caucasians (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15929115/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey &amp; Carter.

The Subcommittee noted that the age of a patient at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival. Despite AML presenting at a younger age in Māori people, the higher incidence of comorbidities in the Māori population would result in Māori having a higher likelihood of being ineligible for intensive chemotherapy after diagnosis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that <a href="""" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Chan et al.</a> also reported that AML appears to disproportionately affect those who live in more socio-economically deprived areas (NZDep2013), with 23% of cases reported in the most deprived 20% of the population, compared with 16% of the cases in the least deprived 20%, and that socio-economic deprivation was also an adverse prognostic factor. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy constitutes approximately 50% of newly diagnosed AML patients (approximately 60 - 70 patients per year).

The Subcommittee considered that most patients who respond are likely to do so within 4-6 cycles. LoDAC can be self-administered (twice daily) by the patient/caregiver in the community, which minimises the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility. The Subcommittee considered that because of its stability post constitution, it can be more readily administered by patient or carer in the community without regular day ward attendance.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that azacitidine is funded for patients with AML, 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia and that LoDAC is open listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule.

The Subcommittee noted that this may impact up to 15% of the AML population in New Zealand.

The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct comparison of venetoclax with azacitidine and venetoclax with LoDAC but considered that because the patient demographics of each trial were similar, comparison of outcomes between the trials would be reasonable. Hence, it was reasonable to deduce that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine was the most effective therapeutic approach for this population and that the lack of azacitidine resulted in inferior outcomes.

The Subcommittee considered that most patients who respond are likely to do so within 4-6 cycles. LoDAC can be self-administered (twice daily) by the patient/caregiver in the community, which minimises the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility.

The Subcommittee noted that CY3PA or P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed to patients with AML, can enhance the action and toxicity of venetoclax, which would require dosage modifications to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that tumour lysis syndrome is relatively uncommon (around 5% of patients, 1.4% of which would be considered serious) and that all patients are recommended to receive allopurinol to further alleviate the risk.
