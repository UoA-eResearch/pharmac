The Committee noted that clinicians in New Zealand generally use the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) to assess UC disease activity, while the Mayo index (which requires endoscopic examination) is often used to measure UC outcomes in clinical trials. Members considered that an SCCAI score of four or greater, or a Mayo score of six or higher, indicates moderate disease activity.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the incidence and prevalence of UC in New Zealand has been estimated to be 7.5 and 145 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, which corresponds to up to 7,250 New Zealanders living with UC (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17012964/"" target=""_blank"">Gearry et al. Inflamm bowel dis. 2006;12:936-43</a>); members considered these rates could slowly be increasing and that more patients are living with chronic UC.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that current standard of care treatment for patients with UC follows a stepwise approach, initially using pharmaceutical treatments including aminosalicylates (mesalazine and sulphasalazine), corticosteroids (prednisone), and immunomodulators (azathioprine and mercaptopurine). Treatment is escalated to include anti-TNF therapies e.g. infliximab, for moderately to severely active UC that has not responded to earlier treatments, and then surgical resection if these treatments provide insufficient disease control. The Committee noted that response to a biologic therapy may delay colectomy, noting that UC often has a severe phase for the initial few years post-diagnosis with potential to abate, allowing a step down from biologic therapy if the patient has been adequately managed on biologics during the severe phase. However, the Committee considered that not all patients would proceed through all lines of funded therapy, as some may opt out of medical management at each step and proceed directly to surgery.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for first-line treatment of UC and the current Special Authority criteria allows for higher dosing as rescue therapy (to control disease flares) after 16 weeks. The Committee noted that the supplier estimated 700 people per year receive infliximab for UC, and the last Gastrointestinal Subcommittee advice (from <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2014-05-21.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2014</a>) was that about 500 patients have moderate or severe UC that would be intolerant or refractory to other treatments and could be eligible for a second line biologic, if funded. The Committee considered that few of these patients would not be receiving treatment i.e. patients would either continue on infliximab or would proceed to surgery. Members considered that many patients would be on long-term maintenance infliximab treatment e.g. out to 3 years. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that approximately 30% of New Zealand patients who receive infliximab for UC achieve and maintain a response. The Committee estimated that between 5 and 10% of patients who experience a suboptimal response to infliximab may continue to meet funding criteria for renewal, and choose to continue infliximab as they are receiving sufficient benefit to warrant ongoing treatment. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that patients with moderately to severely active UC who have experienced either: inadequate response to, intolerable side effects from, contraindications to, or loss of response from, infliximab would have a high health need. Members considered that at least 50%, and potentially up to 80%, of patients who do not receive a response from infliximab will subsequently require surgery if no other medical options are available. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that some patients who proceed to colectomy may require up to 3 operations to achieve the final result. The surgical option will usually provide health benefits, but also carries risks of short- and long-term complications. The Committee considered it had seen no evidence about the incidence of colectomy for UC in New Zealand, however, members considered that colectomy rates are decreasing in some countries, partly driven by optimal use of thiopurines and the use of anti-TNF agents. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin 12 and interleukin 23, naturally occurring proteins that regulate the immune system and immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. The Committee noted that ustekinumab is Medsafe-approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and for the treatment of patients with severe plaque psoriasis, patients with active psoriatic arthritis, and patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD). </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ustekinumab has previously been considered by PHARMAC for the treatment of CD and for psoriasis, and that these proposals have been ranked. The Committee noted the differences in disease course and response to treatment for UC and CD, and noted that evidence for the use of ustekinumab in CD (reviewed by PTAC in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-05.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2018</a>, the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2018-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Oct 2018</a> and PTAC in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Feb 2019</a>) was based on the UNITI-1, UNITI-2 and IM-UNITI clinical trials conducted in biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients with CD; these studies also provide data for ustekinumab maintenance in CD.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in clinical trials in UC the group randomised to placebo sometimes have a substantial reported response rate. Members noted that, based on the previously reviewed reports of the use of ustekinumab in CD, there was a 36% response rate in participants who received induction treatment with ustekinumab and then placebo maintenance, compared with 53% in participants who continued on ustekinumab 8-weekly after induction treatment. Members considered that the proportion of patients with CD in long-term follow-up who were in remission was consistent with ongoing reduction in disease activity after ustekinumab induction.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the evidence from the phase 3, randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled UNIFI trial of ustekinumab induction (intravenous ustekinumab 130 mg or 6 mg per kg dosing, or placebo) followed by maintenance in patients whose disease responded to induction therapy (subcutaneous ustekinumab 90 mg 8-weekly [q8w] or 90 mg 12-weekly [q12w], or placebo) in 961 patients with moderate to severe UC for whom other biologic or non-biologic therapies have failed (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31553833/?dopt=Abstract"" target=""_blank"">Sands et al.

The Committee noted that more than half of patients (N = 491) with moderate to severe UC had experienced failure of at least one biologic treatment, and many patients received ustekinumab third-line (N = 160) due to previous use of vedolizumab as well as infliximab or other anti-TNF agent.

The Committee noted that clinicians in New Zealand generally use the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) to assess UC disease activity, while the Mayo index (which requires endoscopic examination) is often used to measure UC outcomes in clinical trials.

Treatment is escalated to include anti-TNF therapies e.g. infliximab, for moderately to severely active UC that has not responded to earlier treatments, and then surgical resection if these treatments provide insufficient disease control. The Committee noted that response to a biologic therapy may delay colectomy, noting that UC often has a severe phase for the initial few years post-diagnosis with potential to abate, allowing a step down from biologic therapy if the patient has been adequately managed on biologics during the severe phase. However, the Committee considered that not all patients would proceed through all lines of funded therapy, as some may opt out of medical management at each step and proceed directly to surgery.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for first-line treatment of UC and the current Special Authority criteria allows for higher dosing as rescue therapy (to control disease flares) after 16 weeks. The Committee noted that the supplier estimated 700 people per year receive infliximab for UC, and the last Gastrointestinal Subcommittee advice (from <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2014-05-21.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2014</a>) was that about 500 patients have moderate or severe UC that would be intolerant or refractory to other treatments and could be eligible for a second line biologic, if funded.
