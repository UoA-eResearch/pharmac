The panel considered that the TOBI Podhaler had comparable efficacy to TIS, would reduce the treatment burden, and would result in less bacterial contamination compared to nebulised TIS. </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that PHARMAC\u2019s estimate of the size of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population with chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Psa</i>) infection was reflective of the 2015 Port CF NZ Registry data, which reported the prevalence of cystic fibrosis at 449 with approximately one-third of patients having documented evidence of <i>Psa</i> infection, and considered that this was consistent with 2018 dispensing data for the TOBI nebulised inhalation solution (TIS).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with cystic fibrosis and <i>Psa</i> infection have a high health need due to the high treatment burden, significant morbidity and mortality, high rates of acute pulmonary exacerbations and subsequent hospitalisations for prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, and potential lung transplantation. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the sub-population with the greatest health need is children aged less than 12 years. The Committee noted the significant impact of cystic fibrosis with <i>Psa</i> infection on the family/wh\u0101nau and the health system, and acknowledged the increased rates of parental depression and anxiety and, and substantial parental/caregiver treatment burden associated with caring for children with cystic fibrosis. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that in New Zealand, approximately 20% of the total hospitalisations occur in M\u0101ori patients, and that this was disproportionate to the relative incidence of cystic fibrosis in M\u0101ori in New Zealand, suggesting higher case-morbidity rates.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the proposed comparator (TIS) is not always used in this setting as indicated on the Medsafe datasheet. Instead of ongoing treatment in a 28-days-on/ 28-days-off cycle as indicated in the datasheet, the Committee understood that TIS may be used as a two-to-three month course over the winter months, or continuously for some patients. The Committee considered that this usage pattern would likely be no different for the TOBI Podhaler. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed use of the same dosing regimen for all patients, independent of age or weight, was potentially problematic. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed the problems innate to nebulised therapy, noting that the hygroscopic properties of nebulised TIS may be associated with less deposition of drug into the peripheral airways compared to the TOBI Podhaler (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3146747/\" target=\"_blank\">Geller et al. J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2011;24:175-182</a>). The Committee noted that TIS also requires refrigerated storage; in comparison, the TOBI Podhaler has an extended shelf-life at room temperature, is portable and does not require an electrical source, reducing treatment burden compared with the nebulised TIS. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic <i>Psa</i> infection often require nebulised bronchodilators, mucolytics, hypertonic saline, intravenous antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and chest physiotherapy. The committee considered quality of life results from a longitudinal study of adults with cystic fibrosis, reporting that patients usually spend 2-3 hours per day carrying out their treatment regimens (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680350/\" target=\"_blank\">Sawicki et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009;10:91-6</a>). The Committee considered that nebulised tobramycin was only one of multiple therapies for these patients, and thus had limited incremental impact on the overall time burden of cystic fibrosis therapy. The Committee considered the EAGER study, an open-label study in which 553 patients were randomised 3:2 to TOBI Podhaler or TIS twice daily for three treatment cycles (28 days on-drug, 28 days off-drug), in which the mean duration of drug administration with TOBI Podhaler was significantly less than the inhalation solution and equated to approximately 15 minutes of time saved per use, or 30 minutes per day (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931000144X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Konstan et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2011;10:54-61</a>).</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that nebulisers are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria and fungi due to difficulties associated with cleaning nebulisers, which can also be time-consuming and add to the overall treatment burden. The Committee considered an open-label, crossover, interventional phase IV study in cystic fibrosis patients aged <span style=\"\">\u2a7e</span>6 years, in which significantly more devices in the TOBI inhalation solution group were contaminated with bacteria and fungi than those in the TOBI Podhaler group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933634/\" target=\"_blank\">Greenwood et al. Ther Adv Respir Dis. 2017;11:249-60</a>). The Committee considered that there was no evidence that this resulted in any increased risk of re-infection for cystic fibrosis patients, but noted that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease this was a substantial risk factor for exacerbations. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that risk factors for development of multi-drug resistant <i>Psa</i> include CF-related diabetes, frequent antibiotic courses, and repeated hospitalisations. Long-term tobramycin administration is also a risk factor, however, the Committee found it was not possible to assess if use of the TOBI Podhaler may increase the likelihood of eradicating <i>Psa</i> due to improved adherence and improved intrapulmonary deposition or whether it may inadvertently increase the likelihood of development of multi-drug resistant <i>Psa </i>through increased adherence.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the input from the cystic fibrosis panel that described the comparable efficacy, reduced treatment burden, reduced bacterial contamination and improved treatment adherence of the TOBI Podhaler compared to the TOBI inhalation solution. The Committee agreed with the panel\u2019s view that there would be patients who would not be able to use the TOBI Podhaler due to difficulties generating sufficient inspiratory flow, incoordination and the presence of cough. The committee considered that approximately 20-30% of patients would still require access to the TOBI inhalation solution if the TOBI Podhaler were funded.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in a retrospective survey in a small number of adults, 75% of patients over 12 months reported they required no intravenous antibiotics during treatment with TOBI Podhaler, which was significantly better than had occurred in the 12 months prior to baseline with the use of the TOBI inhalation solution (44%) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199314000915?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison et al.

The Committee agreed with the panel\u2019s view that there would be patients who would not be able to use the TOBI Podhaler due to difficulties generating sufficient inspiratory flow, incoordination and the presence of cough. The committee considered that approximately 20-30% of patients would still require access to the TOBI inhalation solution if the TOBI Podhaler were funded.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in a retrospective survey in a small number of adults, 75% of patients over 12 months reported they required no intravenous antibiotics during treatment with TOBI Podhaler, which was significantly better than had occurred in the 12 months prior to baseline with the use of the TOBI inhalation solution (44%) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199314000915?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison et al.

The Committee considered that in this study, the discontinuation rates were higher in patients randomised to the TOBI Podhaler compared to the TOBI inhalation solution (26.9% vs 18.2%).

The Committee considered that these patient satisfaction were largely driven by the reduced time burden for the TOBI Podhaler compared with the TOBI inhalation solution (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931000144X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Konstan et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933634/\" target=\"_blank\">Greenwood 2017</a>).</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the significant price difference between the TOBI Podhaler and the TOBI inhalation solution. The Committee considered that, despite the high need for inhaled tobramycin in this clinical setting, the price differential between the two delivery systems was disproportionately large, and that the price premium was difficult to reconcile with the modest incremental value of the TOBI Podhaler in comparison with the TOBI inhalation solution.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee considered however that there is a lack of evidence to support substantial improvements in adherence and other important health outcomes.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittee also recommended funding both the TOBI inhalation solution and the TOBI Podhaler with a medium priority under Special Authority for patients who have had an adverse reaction to the IV tobramycin.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the new application from Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand for TOBI Podhaler, and noted that the application did not provide any new efficacy evidence not already considered by the Respiratory Subcommittee in 2014.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the TOBI Podhaler has Medsafe approval, but that it is not currently supplied or marketed in New Zealand.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia, Scottish Medicines Commission, The National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence (England/Wales), and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health had all recommended funding of TOBI Podhaler. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the Cystic Fibrosis Panel advice of January 2020. The panel considered that the TOBI Podhaler had comparable efficacy to TIS, would reduce the treatment burden, and would result in less bacterial contamination compared to nebulised TIS. </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that PHARMAC\u2019s estimate of the size of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population with chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Psa</i>) infection was reflective of the 2015 Port CF NZ Registry data, which reported the prevalence of cystic fibrosis at 449 with approximately one-third of patients having documented evidence of <i>Psa</i> infection, and considered that this was consistent with 2018 dispensing data for the TOBI nebulised inhalation solution (TIS).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with cystic fibrosis and <i>Psa</i> infection have a high health need due to the high treatment burden, significant morbidity and mortality, high rates of acute pulmonary exacerbations and subsequent hospitalisations for prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, and potential lung transplantation. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the sub-population with the greatest health need is children aged less than 12 years. The Committee noted the significant impact of cystic fibrosis with <i>Psa</i> infection on the family/wh\u0101nau and the health system, and acknowledged the increased rates of parental depression and anxiety and, and substantial parental/caregiver treatment burden associated with caring for children with cystic fibrosis. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that in New Zealand, approximately 20% of the total hospitalisations occur in M\u0101ori patients, and that this was disproportionate to the relative incidence of cystic fibrosis in M\u0101ori in New Zealand, suggesting higher case-morbidity rates.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the proposed comparator (TIS) is not always used in this setting as indicated on the Medsafe datasheet. Instead of ongoing treatment in a 28-days-on/ 28-days-off cycle as indicated in the datasheet, the Committee understood that TIS may be used as a two-to-three month course over the winter months, or continuously for some patients. The Committee considered that this usage pattern would likely be no different for the TOBI Podhaler. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the proposed use of the same dosing regimen for all patients, independent of age or weight, was potentially problematic. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed the problems innate to nebulised therapy, noting that the hygroscopic properties of nebulised TIS may be associated with less deposition of drug into the peripheral airways compared to the TOBI Podhaler (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3146747/\" target=\"_blank\">Geller et al. J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2011;24:175-182</a>). The Committee noted that TIS also requires refrigerated storage; in comparison, the TOBI Podhaler has an extended shelf-life at room temperature, is portable and does not require an electrical source, reducing treatment burden compared with the nebulised TIS. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic <i>Psa</i> infection often require nebulised bronchodilators, mucolytics, hypertonic saline, intravenous antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and chest physiotherapy. The committee considered quality of life results from a longitudinal study of adults with cystic fibrosis, reporting that patients usually spend 2-3 hours per day carrying out their treatment regimens (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680350/\" target=\"_blank\">Sawicki et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009;10:91-6</a>). The Committee considered that nebulised tobramycin was only one of multiple therapies for these patients, and thus had limited incremental impact on the overall time burden of cystic fibrosis therapy. The Committee considered the EAGER study, an open-label study in which 553 patients were randomised 3:2 to TOBI Podhaler or TIS twice daily for three treatment cycles (28 days on-drug, 28 days off-drug), in which the mean duration of drug administration with TOBI Podhaler was significantly less than the inhalation solution and equated to approximately 15 minutes of time saved per use, or 30 minutes per day (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931000144X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Konstan et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2011;10:54-61</a>).</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that nebulisers are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria and fungi due to difficulties associated with cleaning nebulisers, which can also be time-consuming and add to the overall treatment burden. The Committee considered an open-label, crossover, interventional phase IV study in cystic fibrosis patients aged <span style=\"\">\u2a7e</span>6 years, in which significantly more devices in the TOBI inhalation solution group were contaminated with bacteria and fungi than those in the TOBI Podhaler group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933634/\" target=\"_blank\">Greenwood et al. Ther Adv Respir Dis. 2017;11:249-60</a>). The Committee considered that there was no evidence that this resulted in any increased risk of re-infection for cystic fibrosis patients, but noted that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease this was a substantial risk factor for exacerbations. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that risk factors for development of multi-drug resistant <i>Psa</i> include CF-related diabetes, frequent antibiotic courses, and repeated hospitalisations. Long-term tobramycin administration is also a risk factor, however, the Committee found it was not possible to assess if use of the TOBI Podhaler may increase the likelihood of eradicating <i>Psa</i> due to improved adherence and improved intrapulmonary deposition or whether it may inadvertently increase the likelihood of development of multi-drug resistant <i>Psa </i>through increased adherence.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the input from the cystic fibrosis panel that described the comparable efficacy, reduced treatment burden, reduced bacterial contamination and improved treatment adherence of the TOBI Podhaler compared to the TOBI inhalation solution. The Committee agreed with the panel\u2019s view that there would be patients who would not be able to use the TOBI Podhaler due to difficulties generating sufficient inspiratory flow, incoordination and the presence of cough. The committee considered that approximately 20-30% of patients would still require access to the TOBI inhalation solution if the TOBI Podhaler were funded.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in a retrospective survey in a small number of adults, 75% of patients over 12 months reported they required no intravenous antibiotics during treatment with TOBI Podhaler, which was significantly better than had occurred in the 12 months prior to baseline with the use of the TOBI inhalation solution (44%) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199314000915?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2014;13(6):692-8</a>). However, the committee considered that the evidence for an efficacy benefit for TOBI Podhaler over the TOBI inhalation solution was of low quality because the comparator was retrospective (including time-dependent differential recall bias), and the sample was small (N=78).</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199314000915?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison et al. 2014</a> study had patients self-reporting improved adherence in the 12 months when using the TOBI Podhaler, compared with when using the TOBI inhalation solution prior to baseline. The Committee considered this result was consistent with another similar retrospective observational follow-up study that reported increased adherence to TOBI Podhaler compared with the TOBI inhalation solution (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954-6111(18)30106-9\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: blue;\">Blasi et al. Resp Med. 2018;88-94</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">)</u>. The Committee considered that while it had been reported that improved adherence to tobramycin inhalation solution was associated with reduced risk of hospitalisations in another retrospective observational follow-up study (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3033861/\" target=\"_blank\">Briesacher et al. BMC Pulm Med. 2011;11:5</a>), there was no published evidence of improved adherence and reduced hospitalisation rates with the TOBI Podhaler compared to the TOBI inhalation solution. </p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted again the results of the EAGER study (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931000144X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Konstan et al. 2011</a>, above), which described an increased rate of cough in the TOBI Podhaler group than the TOBI inhalation solution and that this reduced over time. The Committee considered that in this study, the discontinuation rates were higher in patients randomised to the TOBI Podhaler compared to the TOBI inhalation solution (26.9% vs 18.2%). Members noted that a key driver for the increased discontinuation rates may have been the increased incidence of cough.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the main improvement with the TOBI Podhaler compared with the TOBI inhalation solution was in patient satisfaction and preference, due to the reduced treatment burden, and cited the results of the EAGER trial and the Greenwood et al study as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) and the Chronic Treatment Acceptance Questionnaire (ACCEPT). The Committee considered that these patient satisfaction were largely driven by the reduced time burden for the TOBI Podhaler compared with the TOBI inhalation solution (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931000144X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Konstan et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933634/\" target=\"_blank\">Greenwood 2017</a>).</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the significant price difference between the TOBI Podhaler and the TOBI inhalation solution. The Committee considered that, despite the high need for inhaled tobramycin in this clinical setting, the price differential between the two delivery systems was disproportionately large, and that the price premium was difficult to reconcile with the modest incremental value of the TOBI Podhaler in comparison with the TOBI inhalation solution.\u00a0</p>",
