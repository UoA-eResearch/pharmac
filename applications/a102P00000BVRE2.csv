The Committee noted that Māori are significantly disproportionately represented and that approximately 5.8% of wāhine Māori with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. The Committee also noted that breast-cancer specific survival (ie only including those who died of breast cancer) was 84% at 10 years for wāhine Māori, compared to 87% for those of European ethnicity (Te Rēhita Mate Ūtaetae - Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=""https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2003-2020 report</a>). </p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the application from Breast\xa0Cancer\xa0Aotearoa\xa0Coalition (BCAC) for the use of eribulin for the treatment of individuals with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (HER-2 negative and triple negative breast cancers) who have progressed after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease.

It is the most advanced stage of breast cancer and that breast cancers can contain any of the three major receptors often found in breast cancer: oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor. The Committee noted that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells do not present with any of the three receptors. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that according to a <a href=""https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/3120/1/bcfnz-abc-report-2018-reprint-10.2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2018 report by Breast Cancer Foundation NZ</a>, approximately 350 New Zealanders are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer per year. The Committee noted that it is unclear if this also includes those who progress to an advanced stage of disease following an earlier diagnosis. The Committee noted that approximately 84% of breast cancers are HER2-negative, equating to 294 of the advanced breast cancers diagnosed annually. The Committee noted that men can also develop breast cancer but considered that the numbers were uncertain. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that approximately 5.8% of wāhine Māori living with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage, compared to 4.7% of those of European ethnicity (Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=""https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2003-2020 report</a>).
