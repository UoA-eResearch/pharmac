Members noted the paucity of evidence available, with only one study identified (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695316/\" target=\"_blank\">Connolly et al. BMJ Open. 2017;7</a>), which suggested no difference in testosterone levels between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in old age but was confined to very old age groups and considered affected by selection bias. No further evidence was identified. The Committee therefore considered that the impact on M\u0101ori health outcomes to be unknown.</p><h2><strong><em>Background</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac has been informed of an upcoming discontinuation of testosterone undecanoate capsules, and that funding of this presentation is currently restricted to those who received treatment prior to 1 November 2021. The Committee noted that email correspondence with members of the Endocrinology Advisory Committee indicates that this discontinuation will result in an unmet health need; in particular, for those with a true needle phobia for injectable products or allergy to patches. The Committee noted that Pharmac has been unable to secure an ongoing supply of testosterone capsules, and that this application considers funding a gel in order to meet the health need of people requiring ongoing testosterone treatment for whom other funded options are unsuitable.</p><h2><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical features of male hypogonadism are dependent upon the age of onset and severity of testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that this funding application focused on adult onset (post pubertal), as Pharmac staff understood this would comprise the majority of use. The Committee noted that there would likely be some pubertal use as well for the management of adolescents experiencing delayed puberty. The Committee also considered that other patient groups requiring testosterone replacement therapy may include postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and transgender individuals.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee<strong> </strong>noted that the <a href=\"https://uroweb.org/guidelines/sexual-and-reproductive-health\" target=\"_blank\">2022 updated guidelines</a> on male hypogonadism from the European Association of Urology state that androgen deficiency increases with age, with the major causes being: central obesity, overall poor health, and other comorbidities (eg diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer). The Committee noted that up to the age of 80 years, aging accounts for a low proportion of hypogonadism. The Committee noted that the incidence of symptomatic hypogonadism in men aged 40-79 years varies between 2.1-5.7%, and the overall incidence of hypogonadism has been reported to be 12.3 and 11.7 cases per 1,000 people per year. The Committee also noted that male hypogonadism is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there is a high health need for patients with testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that, regarding adult testosterone deficiency, the applicant had listed symptoms including fatigue, loss of libido, loss of body hair, muscle wasting, and weight loss, extending in some cases to osteoporosis and anaemia. The Committee were made aware of a study that reported that those with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/12/2622/htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ka\u0142u\u017cna et al. J Clin Med. 2021;10:2622</a>). The Committee considered that the health need may also extend to that of the family, wh\u0101nau, and partners of those with testosterone deficiency.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are a range of fully funded testosterone products currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule, including patches and injections. The Committee noted that 79% of patients using testosterone products are using injections (cipionate, esters, undecanoate), 12% using undecanoate capsules, and 10% using patches. The Committee noted that the median age of patch users is 40 years and of capsule users is 64 years, and that there is a bimodal age distribution for testosterone injections with peaks at ages 20-29 and then 60-79 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there are several suitability issues with currently available products. The Committee noted that evidence from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, supplied by the applicant, cites up to 59% of recipients of testosterone patches experienced skin rash or irritation. The Committee also considered the patches to have administration issues regarding poor adhesion of the patch to the skin. The Committee also considered that there are suitability issues with injectable preparations in the small proportion of patients with needle phobia.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that testosterone gel is a hydroalcoholic gel absorbed through the skin, and that the circulating testosterone mainly binds to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin. The Committee noted that there are no Medsafe-approved testosterone gel products in New Zealand, however, Pharmac staff are seeking advice on this proposal ahead of a commercial process for a non-injectable testosterone product. The Committee noted that the recommended dosing of Testogel (testosterone gel 1%) is equivalent to 50 mg testosterone once daily, which can be adjusted in 25 mg increments up to a maximum of 100 mg testosterone daily. The Committee noted that Testogel should be administered by the patient onto clean, dry, healthy skin over both shoulders, or both arms, or abdomen (<a href=\"https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6808/smpc#gref\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Medicines Compendium: Testogel SPC. 2021</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence regarding the efficacy of testosterone gel provided by the applicant:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Scottish Medicines Consortium: A cost effectiveness report for NHS Scotland concluding that testosterone gel offers a cost-effective transdermal treatment for adult male hypogonadism compared with testosterone patches.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(16)30716-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Luthy et al.

Members noted the paucity of evidence available, with only one study identified (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695316/\" target=\"_blank\">Connolly et al. BMJ Open. 2017;7</a>), which suggested no difference in testosterone levels between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in old age but was confined to very old age groups and considered affected by selection bias. No further evidence was identified. The Committee therefore considered that the impact on M\u0101ori health outcomes to be unknown.</p><h2><strong><em>Background</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac has been informed of an upcoming discontinuation of testosterone undecanoate capsules, and that funding of this presentation is currently restricted to those who received treatment prior to 1 November 2021. The Committee noted that email correspondence with members of the Endocrinology Advisory Committee indicates that this discontinuation will result in an unmet health need; in particular, for those with a true needle phobia for injectable products or allergy to patches. The Committee noted that Pharmac has been unable to secure an ongoing supply of testosterone capsules, and that this application considers funding a gel in order to meet the health need of people requiring ongoing testosterone treatment for whom other funded options are unsuitable.</p><h2><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical features of male hypogonadism are dependent upon the age of onset and severity of testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that this funding application focused on adult onset (post pubertal), as Pharmac staff understood this would comprise the majority of use. The Committee noted that there would likely be some pubertal use as well for the management of adolescents experiencing delayed puberty. The Committee also considered that other patient groups requiring testosterone replacement therapy may include postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and transgender individuals.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee<strong> </strong>noted that the <a href=\"https://uroweb.org/guidelines/sexual-and-reproductive-health\" target=\"_blank\">2022 updated guidelines</a> on male hypogonadism from the European Association of Urology state that androgen deficiency increases with age, with the major causes being: central obesity, overall poor health, and other comorbidities (eg diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer). The Committee noted that up to the age of 80 years, aging accounts for a low proportion of hypogonadism. The Committee noted that the incidence of symptomatic hypogonadism in men aged 40-79 years varies between 2.1-5.7%, and the overall incidence of hypogonadism has been reported to be 12.3 and 11.7 cases per 1,000 people per year. The Committee also noted that male hypogonadism is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there is a high health need for patients with testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that, regarding adult testosterone deficiency, the applicant had listed symptoms including fatigue, loss of libido, loss of body hair, muscle wasting, and weight loss, extending in some cases to osteoporosis and anaemia. The Committee were made aware of a study that reported that those with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/12/2622/htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ka\u0142u\u017cna et al. J Clin Med. 2021;10:2622</a>). The Committee considered that the health need may also extend to that of the family, wh\u0101nau, and partners of those with testosterone deficiency.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are a range of fully funded testosterone products currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule, including patches and injections. The Committee noted that 79% of patients using testosterone products are using injections (cipionate, esters, undecanoate), 12% using undecanoate capsules, and 10% using patches. The Committee noted that the median age of patch users is 40 years and of capsule users is 64 years, and that there is a bimodal age distribution for testosterone injections with peaks at ages 20-29 and then 60-79 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there are several suitability issues with currently available products. The Committee noted that evidence from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, supplied by the applicant, cites up to 59% of recipients of testosterone patches experienced skin rash or irritation. The Committee also considered the patches to have administration issues regarding poor adhesion of the patch to the skin. The Committee also considered that there are suitability issues with injectable preparations in the small proportion of patients with needle phobia.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that testosterone gel is a hydroalcoholic gel absorbed through the skin, and that the circulating testosterone mainly binds to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin. The Committee noted that there are no Medsafe-approved testosterone gel products in New Zealand, however, Pharmac staff are seeking advice on this proposal ahead of a commercial process for a non-injectable testosterone product. The Committee noted that the recommended dosing of Testogel (testosterone gel 1%) is equivalent to 50 mg testosterone once daily, which can be adjusted in 25 mg increments up to a maximum of 100 mg testosterone daily. The Committee noted that Testogel should be administered by the patient onto clean, dry, healthy skin over both shoulders, or both arms, or abdomen (<a href=\"https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6808/smpc#gref\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Medicines Compendium: Testogel SPC. 2021</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence regarding the efficacy of testosterone gel provided by the applicant:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Scottish Medicines Consortium: A cost effectiveness report for NHS Scotland concluding that testosterone gel offers a cost-effective transdermal treatment for adult male hypogonadism compared with testosterone patches.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(16)30716-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Luthy et al.

Members noted the paucity of evidence available, with only one study identified (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695316/\" target=\"_blank\">Connolly et al. BMJ Open. 2017;7</a>), which suggested no difference in testosterone levels between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in old age but was confined to very old age groups and considered affected by selection bias. No further evidence was identified. The Committee therefore considered that the impact on M\u0101ori health outcomes to be unknown.</p><h2><strong><em>Background</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac has been informed of an upcoming discontinuation of testosterone undecanoate capsules, and that funding of this presentation is currently restricted to those who received treatment prior to 1 November 2021. The Committee noted that email correspondence with members of the Endocrinology Advisory Committee indicates that this discontinuation will result in an unmet health need; in particular, for those with a true needle phobia for injectable products or allergy to patches. The Committee noted that Pharmac has been unable to secure an ongoing supply of testosterone capsules, and that this application considers funding a gel in order to meet the health need of people requiring ongoing testosterone treatment for whom other funded options are unsuitable.</p><h2><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical features of male hypogonadism are dependent upon the age of onset and severity of testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that this funding application focused on adult onset (post pubertal), as Pharmac staff understood this would comprise the majority of use. The Committee noted that there would likely be some pubertal use as well for the management of adolescents experiencing delayed puberty. The Committee also considered that other patient groups requiring testosterone replacement therapy may include postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and transgender individuals.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee<strong> </strong>noted that the <a href=\"https://uroweb.org/guidelines/sexual-and-reproductive-health\" target=\"_blank\">2022 updated guidelines</a> on male hypogonadism from the European Association of Urology state that androgen deficiency increases with age, with the major causes being: central obesity, overall poor health, and other comorbidities (eg diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer). The Committee noted that up to the age of 80 years, aging accounts for a low proportion of hypogonadism. The Committee noted that the incidence of symptomatic hypogonadism in men aged 40-79 years varies between 2.1-5.7%, and the overall incidence of hypogonadism has been reported to be 12.3 and 11.7 cases per 1,000 people per year. The Committee also noted that male hypogonadism is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there is a high health need for patients with testosterone deficiency. The Committee noted that, regarding adult testosterone deficiency, the applicant had listed symptoms including fatigue, loss of libido, loss of body hair, muscle wasting, and weight loss, extending in some cases to osteoporosis and anaemia. The Committee were made aware of a study that reported that those with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/12/2622/htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ka\u0142u\u017cna et al. J Clin Med. 2021;10:2622</a>). The Committee considered that the health need may also extend to that of the family, wh\u0101nau, and partners of those with testosterone deficiency.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are a range of fully funded testosterone products currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule, including patches and injections. The Committee noted that 79% of patients using testosterone products are using injections (cipionate, esters, undecanoate), 12% using undecanoate capsules, and 10% using patches. The Committee noted that the median age of patch users is 40 years and of capsule users is 64 years, and that there is a bimodal age distribution for testosterone injections with peaks at ages 20-29 and then 60-79 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there are several suitability issues with currently available products. The Committee noted that evidence from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, supplied by the applicant, cites up to 59% of recipients of testosterone patches experienced skin rash or irritation. The Committee also considered the patches to have administration issues regarding poor adhesion of the patch to the skin. The Committee also considered that there are suitability issues with injectable preparations in the small proportion of patients with needle phobia.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that testosterone gel is a hydroalcoholic gel absorbed through the skin, and that the circulating testosterone mainly binds to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin. The Committee noted that there are no Medsafe-approved testosterone gel products in New Zealand, however, Pharmac staff are seeking advice on this proposal ahead of a commercial process for a non-injectable testosterone product. The Committee noted that the recommended dosing of Testogel (testosterone gel 1%) is equivalent to 50 mg testosterone once daily, which can be adjusted in 25 mg increments up to a maximum of 100 mg testosterone daily. The Committee noted that Testogel should be administered by the patient onto clean, dry, healthy skin over both shoulders, or both arms, or abdomen (<a href=\"https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6808/smpc#gref\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Medicines Compendium: Testogel SPC. 2021</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence regarding the efficacy of testosterone gel provided by the applicant:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Scottish Medicines Consortium: A cost effectiveness report for NHS Scotland concluding that testosterone gel offers a cost-effective transdermal treatment for adult male hypogonadism compared with testosterone patches.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(16)30716-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Luthy et al.

The Committee considered that adherence to treatment would be greater in those using the gel compared to the patches. The Committee noted that there may be secondary exposure risks via transfer of gel to partners and children, however considered that education, cautious administration, and covering the application area minimises this potential risk.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the other potential disadvantages of testosterone gel, including dose titration issues due to the difficulty in measuring an accurate quantity of gel, and the risk of treatment abuse in those patients prescribed higher than the recommended dosage to achieve enhanced and more rapid therapeutic effects. The Committee considered that these patterns of usage may contribute to an increased incidence of overdose and abuse. The Committee noted that the use of a product with a defined dose may mitigate some of these issues.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently 798 patients receiving testosterone undecanoate capsules who would be affected by the discontinuation of this product.

The Committee noted that some patients may trial patches first, however, given the known suitability issues associated with the patches, most patients would use testosterone gel first line. The Committee considered that it would be reasonable to assume an annual discontinuation rate of 15% for patients on testosterone gel.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the overall market for testosterone therapy is growing year-on-year due to its increased use in the transgender patient population. However, it considered that no additional growth over and above the background rate of growth would be expected if testosterone gel was funded.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted Pharmac does not currently have a commercial proposal with which to assess testosterone gel compared with the currently funded treatment options. The Committee noted that, if testosterone gel was funded, and depending on pricing received, Pharmac may consider managing the financial impact with the following Special Authority criteria:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><strong style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\">Special Authority for Subsidy</strong><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\"> - Initial application</span></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10px;\">From any relevant practitioner.

This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.
