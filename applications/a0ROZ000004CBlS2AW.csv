The Committee noted that hypothyroidism is caused by inadequate function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the\xa0pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of\xa0thyrotropin-releasing hormone\xa0from the brain&#39;s\xa0hypothalamus\xa0(tertiary hypothyroidism).</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are highly variable, depending upon the age at onset and the duration and severity of thyroid hormone deficiency.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the adverse impact of hypothyroidism on whānau as a result of caring for an unwell whānau member, however there was no evidence identified in this area.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it is difficult to estimate the number of those with hypothyroidism, given the wide range in literature and inconsistent definitions. The Committee noted that some patient groups with clinical hypothyroidism report persistent symptoms on guideline based T4 replacement therapy. The Committee noted reports that 20% to 60% patients treated with T4 therapy express dissatisfaction according to studies on health-related quality of life (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35959734/"" target=""_blank"">Perros et al. Thyroid. 2022 [preprint]</a>). The Committee noted that that lethargy, low mood, and cognitive issues dominate the reported residual symptoms. The Committee noted that a wide variety of persistent unexplained symptoms are common in the general population and these overlap with the symptoms attributed to hypothyroidism. The Committee considered these are all nonspecific and poorly quantifiable parameters and that there is no conclusive evidence that these residual symptoms are linked to the underlying thyroid disease. It was noted that there are numerous anecdotes and case studies that describe individuals from this group who have symptomatic improvement on combination T3/T4 replacement. The Committee also noted suggestions that T4 monotherapy treatment delivers inadequate T3 at tissue level. Further, the Committee considered that there may be an active autoimmune process driving symptoms, and/or that the persistent symptoms are unrelated to thyroid disease.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the T3 containing treatments included in the application (whole thyroid extract, normal and extended release T3 and synthetic T3/T4) are not approved by Medsafe for use in New Zealand. The Committee noted that the applicant advised that whole thyroid is currently available as a compounded medicine, compounded on an individual, named patient basis, and that patients are currently self-funding this treatment in New Zealand.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the dosing recommendations for thyroid treatments are determined by the laboratory findings and symptoms and adjusted accordingly.

The Committee noted that no new clinical trial evidence was presented by the applicant, and that there was no demonstrated benefit of combination therapy over isolated T4 therapy in the available trials. It was noted that the publications provided since 2018 were opinion pieces from four main protagonists for T3/T4 therapies with a focus on the inadequacies of the published randomised trials, the observation of a growth in utilisation of combination therapies (particularly in USA), extended evidence of benefit of T3/T4 therapy in rat models of hypothyroidism, and evidence around human genetic polymorphisms and other proposed mechanisms that may have a negative impact on T4 to T3 conversion.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the updated International Thyroid Society guidelines referenced by the applicant, which is summarised as follows:</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>British Thyroid Association (BTA) (December 2016): Reiterated the BTA executive committee’s <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26010808/"" target=""_blank"">2015 evidence-based position statement</a> that while T4 therapy remains the standard of care, a carefully audited trial of T3 might be warranted in exceptional cases. Symptoms are not useful as a monitoring tool, reflecting the focus on biochemical monitoring of TSH and T4 to define treatment.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>European Thyroid Journal (June 2012): T4 monotherapy remains the standard of hypothyroidism treatment.

The Committee noted there were no differences for primary and secondary outcomes, except for a minor increase in heart rate caused by DTE. The Committee noted that outcomes were similar among hypothyroid patients taking DTE versus T3/T4 combined versus T4, however, that subgroup analyses of the 1/3 most symptomatic patients on T4 revealed strong preference for treatment containing T3, which improved performance on the 36-point thyroid symptom questionnaire, the 12-point quality of life general health questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the visual memory index (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/106/11/e4400/6311304?login=false"" target=""_blank"">Shakir et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2021;106:e4400-13</a>).</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the results from Shakir et al suggest there is no benefit of T3/T4 combination therapy over T4 alone. The Committee considered that if the proposed treatment group that would benefit from T3/T4 combination therapy (as suggested by the applicant) were accurate, then the randomised controlled data should have identified this. The Committee therefore considered the applicant’s estimate of 16% of currently treated patients who would benefit from T3 containing treatment to be inaccurate. The Committee also considered the post-hoc analysis of this study to be of low quality given this subgroup included only 25 patients.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee reviewed the information provided by the applicant regarding T3/T4 conversion rates. The Committee considered that, given T3 does not cross the blood-brain barrier, the biological plausibility of T3 impacting mood or cognitive symptoms is low. The Committee considered that there can be many factors which impact symptoms such as fatigue. The Committee noted that the only physiological difference observed in Shakir et al was transiently higher heart rate in the DTE group. This observation may provide some plausibility for the argument that symptoms of fatigue are a result of peripheral changes, however that tachycardia is not necessarily a beneficial outcome.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that the studies provided also noted difficulty in titrating T3 levels in participants, suggesting that T3/T4 combination treatment is unlikely to provide good control of symptoms given the differential effects of T3 and the variation between individuals. Members noted the lack of health practitioner resource and experience available for titration of T3 treatment increases the safety risks.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that there is evidence that some patients on T4 therapy are not receiving adequate response and these patients may benefit from T3 treatment. Members considered this group may be individuals with deiodinase issues, which is not easily diagnosed. However, it was considered that the number of individuals in this group is likely to be very small and much lower than the patient numbers estimated by the applicant, explaining why clinical trials have not identified a significant health benefit for T3 treatments to date.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered the quality control of whole thyroid extract is unsatisfactory due to the variation in biochemical responses between individuals. It was considered that, given whole thyroid is only available as a compounded product in New Zealand, this further perpetuates the risk of dose inaccuracy and variability. Members also noted that whole thyroid extract is a porcine product and is therefore inappropriate for use in Jewish and Muslim individuals.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there have been no updates to the cost and savings information for T3 containing treatments since the application was reviewed by PTAC in November 2018. The Committee considered that funding of T3 treatment could potentially increase healthcare expenditure via increased monitoring of T3 levels, repeat visits for titration and increased hospital admissions due to toxicity.</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for T3 containing treatment if they were to be funded in New Zealand for hypothyroidism. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0\xa0</p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000B4BK6&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002eYPX"" alt=""image.png""></img></p>', 'fs': '<h3><em>Māori impact statement</em></h3><p>1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>No evidence was identified on the impact of funding T3 containing treatments for hypothyroidism on Māori health areas of focus or Māori health outcomes.</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that this funding application was reviewed by <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-11.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC in November 2018</a> and recommended for decline.

The Committee noted that some patient groups with clinical hypothyroidism report persistent symptoms on guideline based T4 replacement therapy. The Committee noted reports that 20% to 60% patients treated with T4 therapy express dissatisfaction according to studies on health-related quality of life (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35959734/"" target=""_blank"">Perros et al. Thyroid. 2022 [preprint]</a>). The Committee noted that that lethargy, low mood, and cognitive issues dominate the reported residual symptoms. The Committee noted that a wide variety of persistent unexplained symptoms are common in the general population and these overlap with the symptoms attributed to hypothyroidism. The Committee considered these are all nonspecific and poorly quantifiable parameters and that there is no conclusive evidence that these residual symptoms are linked to the underlying thyroid disease. It was noted that there are numerous anecdotes and case studies that describe individuals from this group who have symptomatic improvement on combination T3/T4 replacement. The Committee also noted suggestions that T4 monotherapy treatment delivers inadequate T3 at tissue level.
