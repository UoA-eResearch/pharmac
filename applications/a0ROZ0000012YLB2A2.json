          "s": "<p>Discussion</p><p>1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that the target patient population is a subset of the population with primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcaemia; the target group is either unsuitable for surgery, have declined surgery or have not benefitted from surgery and have significant hypercalcaemia, defined as albumin-adjusted calcium &gt;3.0 mmol/L with or without symptoms of hypercalcaemia, or &gt;2.85 mmol/L with symptoms of hypercalcaemia (consistent with the definition used in the NICE guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism in the UK and Wales; NICE, 2019). The Subcommittee noted the potential for minor variability in laboratory test values across the country but considered &gt;3.0 mmol/L and &gt;2.85 mmol/L to be reasonable thresholds for defining this population.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.2.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that these patients may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations non-specific to primary hyperparathyroidism itself (eg persistent hypercalcaemia, fracture, renal stones, hypercalciuria, osteoporosis), and may include a neurocognitive presentation with psychotic episodes occurring every few months. The Subcommittee noted that people with primary hypercalcaemia are also at risk of excess death from heart or lung causes. The Subcommittee considered that people with acute symptomatic hypercalcaemia may also require acute interventions for management.</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee estimated that the target group may consist of 6-10 new patients per year nationwide, based on case numbers in Auckland and Christchurch. The Subcommittee considered that most of these patients would likely require treatment when aged in their 70s and 80s and therefore some annual mortality would also be expected, and a very small number of patients may require treatment for many years. The Subcommittee considered that an exceptional number of patients (less than one per year) with rare genetic syndromes might require treatment from a younger age. The Subcommittee considered a patient deemed as not being operable (ie not a candidate for surgery) would likely be considered non-operable for life.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.\u00a0\u00a0Members noted the surgical procedure is complex and, in some patients, may not be deemed feasible or suitable in the surgical or multi-disciplinary team\u2019s opinion (eg due to co-morbidities), or surgery may not be successful in achieving the intended clinical outcomes. In addition, the Subcommittee noted that not all patients may judge their proposed surgery to be beneficial when compared with its risks, and thus that informed consent may not be provided by these patients for anaesthesia and the surgical procedure itself.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there is a lack of evidence to inform whether primary hyperparathyroidism disproportionately affects M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, although noted that these populations may experience greater comorbidity than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific people.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that cinacalcet is taken orally and can be titrated to achieve a reduction in calcium levels to below 3.0 mmol/L and/or treatment of symptoms. The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence that elevated calcium levels are associated with symptoms, and that a reduction in calcium level is associated with symptom improvement. The Subcommittee considered the goal of treatment in this patient group is to reduce serum calcium levels to &lt;3.0 mmol/L (rather than reducing parathyroid hormone levels), as &lt;3.0 mmol/L is considered a \u2018safe\u2019 serum calcium level that reduces the risks of neurocognitive complications of hypercalcaemia, and of episodes of acute severe hypercalcemia.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that new evidence to inform the assessment of cinacalcet in this primary hyperparathyroidism was limited, however, members were made aware of evidence from the following publications (of which, two include cinacalcet for parathyroidectomy non-candidates which referred to hypercalcaemia with unspecified severe symptoms):</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study (audit) in Scotland of 2,598 surgical patients admitted with primary hyperparathyroidism (causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism being excluded) between 1986 to 2010 with data followed up until 2011 and including post-surgery outcomes for those who received parathyroidectomy (Collier et al. Endocr Pract. 2019;25:335-9). The Subcommittee noted that 78% of patients included were female, which the Subcommittee considered was a reasonable estimate of female prevalence in this disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that after follow-up, 41% of the total cohort were deceased and the standardised mortality ratio compared with the general population was 1.58, but that 42% of patients did not have surgery (either they did not meet criteria, or for other reasons), and therefore considered this group was more conservatively treated group than those in New Zealand.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the raw standardised mortality ratio compared to the general population was 1.30 in patients who received surgery (58% of the cohort) and was 1.88 in patients who were treated conservatively; after adjustment for comorbidity, the latter reduced to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.30 to 1.70; P&lt;.0001). The Subcommittee considered the conservatively treated group was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication. Based on this, the Subcommittee considered that hyperparathyroidism increases mortality compared with the general population; that surgery can reduce this mortality; and therefore, that it was reasonable to infer that cinacalcet may provide the same or similar benefit as surgery by reducing mortality by reducing serum calcium levels.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of a systematic review and meta regression of cinacalcet in primary hyperparathyroidism (Ng et al. Endocr Connect. 2020;9:724-35) which included eight trials, none of which the Subcommittee considered provided new information as all had been considered by PTAC or PTAC Subcommittees previously. The Subcommittee noted that 90% of patients had normalisation of calcium levels and 10% had normalisation of parathyroid hormone, however, no other endpoints (eg quality of life) or outcomes for mortality and morbidity were discussed in the publication.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of an 8-year retrospective observational cohort study in Scotland of 611 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism seen in secondary care between 2006 and 2014, of which 337 patients did not receive surgery (Reid et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2019;104:3692-700). The Subcommittee noted that after an 8-year period of follow-up, the mortality rate was 16.0% (98/611) overall, with about 30% of deaths due to cancer and about 30% due to cardiovascular disease. The Subcommittee noted that 79 deaths were reported in the group who did not receive surgery. The Subcommittee noted associations between mortality and increasing age, social deprivation, and elevated adjusted calcium levels at diagnosis that were statistically significant, but no associations with parathyroid hormone levels at diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that the study population was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication and was the most representative evidence for the target New Zealand population. The Subcommittee considered it may not be feasible to do an appropriately powered intervention study in this population.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study derived from a random population sample of 750 50-year-old men in Sweden that described a 21 year follow up of men with primary hyperparathyroidism, and which did not show evidence for long term complications nor a mortality difference. The Subcommittee noted this study reported very wide confidence intervals (Kontogeorgos et al. Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2020;80:6-13).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that UpToDate suggests cinacalcet be used for patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to have surgery (whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic and/or severe hypercalcemia), and that cinacalcet would be more appropriate than bisphosphonates where bone density is normal, as supported by literature review updated in April 2021.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the previously mentioned NICE guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism in the UK and Wales (NICE, 2019) recommend cinacalcet be used for patients in whom surgery fails or is denied, to treat symptomatic patients with calcium over 2.85 mmol/L and patients with calcium levels of &gt;3.0 mmol/L with or without symptoms. Members noted that the NICE guidelines state that bisphosphonates should not be used for chronic hypercalcaemia of primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of improved mortality from secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on renal dialysis in particular, and that this comorbid population experiences high event rates and pathology-related mortality from hypercalcaemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, due to the toxicity of the parathyroid hormone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the Subcommittee considered that existing evidence for efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism is robust. The Subcommittee considered the health benefit for hypercalcaemia is based on biochemical and end-organ endpoints after surgery (which the Subcommittee considered provides strong evidence), and that there is a lack of evidence for reduced mortality in the population with primary hypercalcaemia following treatment with cinacalcet.</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there was no new evidence of biochemical efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium, although existing evidence for this is robust and that there was strong evidence for cinacalcet compared with surgery in normalising calcium levels (but not in reducing parathyroid hormone levels).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Summary</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a reduction in calcium to less than 3.0 mmol/L was clinically meaningful and a critical outcome for the target group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, whereas that a reduction in parathyroid hormone was not the target outcome for this group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to infer, based on the evidence of benefits (including reduction in mortality) from calcium level reduction (from surgery and from the use of cinacalcet in several hypercalcaemic states), that cinacalcet could result in clinically meaningful benefits from a calcium level reduction in people with primary hyperparathyroidism who are not deemed operable. The Subcommittee considered that, while there was limited evidence for the effect of cinacalcet on endpoints such as cardiovascular outcomes, fractures and mortality, it was reasonable to assume that a clinically significant reduction in calcium levels would be associated with improvement in these endpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>1.15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered it reasonable for cinacalcet to be funded for people with primary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypercalcemia who are not deemed operable, and have no available alternative treatments. Members noted many such patients would experience neurocognitive effects from elevated calcium.

          "fs": "<p>Discussion</p><p>1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that the target patient population is a subset of the population with primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcaemia; the target group is either unsuitable for surgery, have declined surgery or have not benefitted from surgery and have significant hypercalcaemia, defined as albumin-adjusted calcium &gt;3.0 mmol/L with or without symptoms of hypercalcaemia, or &gt;2.85 mmol/L with symptoms of hypercalcaemia (consistent with the definition used in the NICE guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism in the UK and Wales; NICE, 2019). The Subcommittee noted the potential for minor variability in laboratory test values across the country but considered &gt;3.0 mmol/L and &gt;2.85 mmol/L to be reasonable thresholds for defining this population.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.2.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that these patients may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations non-specific to primary hyperparathyroidism itself (eg persistent hypercalcaemia, fracture, renal stones, hypercalciuria, osteoporosis), and may include a neurocognitive presentation with psychotic episodes occurring every few months. The Subcommittee noted that people with primary hypercalcaemia are also at risk of excess death from heart or lung causes. The Subcommittee considered that people with acute symptomatic hypercalcaemia may also require acute interventions for management.</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee estimated that the target group may consist of 6-10 new patients per year nationwide, based on case numbers in Auckland and Christchurch. The Subcommittee considered that most of these patients would likely require treatment when aged in their 70s and 80s and therefore some annual mortality would also be expected, and a very small number of patients may require treatment for many years. The Subcommittee considered that an exceptional number of patients (less than one per year) with rare genetic syndromes might require treatment from a younger age. The Subcommittee considered a patient deemed as not being operable (ie not a candidate for surgery) would likely be considered non-operable for life.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.4.\u00a0\u00a0Members noted the surgical procedure is complex and, in some patients, may not be deemed feasible or suitable in the surgical or multi-disciplinary team\u2019s opinion (eg due to co-morbidities), or surgery may not be successful in achieving the intended clinical outcomes. In addition, the Subcommittee noted that not all patients may judge their proposed surgery to be beneficial when compared with its risks, and thus that informed consent may not be provided by these patients for anaesthesia and the surgical procedure itself.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5.\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there is a lack of evidence to inform whether primary hyperparathyroidism disproportionately affects M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, although noted that these populations may experience greater comorbidity than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific people.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that cinacalcet is taken orally and can be titrated to achieve a reduction in calcium levels to below 3.0 mmol/L and/or treatment of symptoms. The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence that elevated calcium levels are associated with symptoms, and that a reduction in calcium level is associated with symptom improvement. The Subcommittee considered the goal of treatment in this patient group is to reduce serum calcium levels to &lt;3.0 mmol/L (rather than reducing parathyroid hormone levels), as &lt;3.0 mmol/L is considered a \u2018safe\u2019 serum calcium level that reduces the risks of neurocognitive complications of hypercalcaemia, and of episodes of acute severe hypercalcemia.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that new evidence to inform the assessment of cinacalcet in this primary hyperparathyroidism was limited, however, members were made aware of evidence from the following publications (of which, two include cinacalcet for parathyroidectomy non-candidates which referred to hypercalcaemia with unspecified severe symptoms):</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study (audit) in Scotland of 2,598 surgical patients admitted with primary hyperparathyroidism (causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism being excluded) between 1986 to 2010 with data followed up until 2011 and including post-surgery outcomes for those who received parathyroidectomy (Collier et al. Endocr Pract. 2019;25:335-9). The Subcommittee noted that 78% of patients included were female, which the Subcommittee considered was a reasonable estimate of female prevalence in this disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that after follow-up, 41% of the total cohort were deceased and the standardised mortality ratio compared with the general population was 1.58, but that 42% of patients did not have surgery (either they did not meet criteria, or for other reasons), and therefore considered this group was more conservatively treated group than those in New Zealand.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the raw standardised mortality ratio compared to the general population was 1.30 in patients who received surgery (58% of the cohort) and was 1.88 in patients who were treated conservatively; after adjustment for comorbidity, the latter reduced to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.30 to 1.70; P&lt;.0001). The Subcommittee considered the conservatively treated group was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication. Based on this, the Subcommittee considered that hyperparathyroidism increases mortality compared with the general population; that surgery can reduce this mortality; and therefore, that it was reasonable to infer that cinacalcet may provide the same or similar benefit as surgery by reducing mortality by reducing serum calcium levels.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of a systematic review and meta regression of cinacalcet in primary hyperparathyroidism (Ng et al. Endocr Connect. 2020;9:724-35) which included eight trials, none of which the Subcommittee considered provided new information as all had been considered by PTAC or PTAC Subcommittees previously. The Subcommittee noted that 90% of patients had normalisation of calcium levels and 10% had normalisation of parathyroid hormone, however, no other endpoints (eg quality of life) or outcomes for mortality and morbidity were discussed in the publication.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of an 8-year retrospective observational cohort study in Scotland of 611 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism seen in secondary care between 2006 and 2014, of which 337 patients did not receive surgery (Reid et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2019;104:3692-700). The Subcommittee noted that after an 8-year period of follow-up, the mortality rate was 16.0% (98/611) overall, with about 30% of deaths due to cancer and about 30% due to cardiovascular disease. The Subcommittee noted that 79 deaths were reported in the group who did not receive surgery. The Subcommittee noted associations between mortality and increasing age, social deprivation, and elevated adjusted calcium levels at diagnosis that were statistically significant, but no associations with parathyroid hormone levels at diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that the study population was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication and was the most representative evidence for the target New Zealand population. The Subcommittee considered it may not be feasible to do an appropriately powered intervention study in this population.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study derived from a random population sample of 750 50-year-old men in Sweden that described a 21 year follow up of men with primary hyperparathyroidism, and which did not show evidence for long term complications nor a mortality difference. The Subcommittee noted this study reported very wide confidence intervals (Kontogeorgos et al. Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2020;80:6-13).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that UpToDate suggests cinacalcet be used for patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to have surgery (whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic and/or severe hypercalcemia), and that cinacalcet would be more appropriate than bisphosphonates where bone density is normal, as supported by literature review updated in April 2021.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the previously mentioned NICE guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism in the UK and Wales (NICE, 2019) recommend cinacalcet be used for patients in whom surgery fails or is denied, to treat symptomatic patients with calcium over 2.85 mmol/L and patients with calcium levels of &gt;3.0 mmol/L with or without symptoms. Members noted that the NICE guidelines state that bisphosphonates should not be used for chronic hypercalcaemia of primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of improved mortality from secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on renal dialysis in particular, and that this comorbid population experiences high event rates and pathology-related mortality from hypercalcaemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, due to the toxicity of the parathyroid hormone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the Subcommittee considered that existing evidence for efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism is robust. The Subcommittee considered the health benefit for hypercalcaemia is based on biochemical and end-organ endpoints after surgery (which the Subcommittee considered provides strong evidence), and that there is a lack of evidence for reduced mortality in the population with primary hypercalcaemia following treatment with cinacalcet.</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there was no new evidence of biochemical efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium, although existing evidence for this is robust and that there was strong evidence for cinacalcet compared with surgery in normalising calcium levels (but not in reducing parathyroid hormone levels).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Summary</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a reduction in calcium to less than 3.0 mmol/L was clinically meaningful and a critical outcome for the target group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, whereas that a reduction in parathyroid hormone was not the target outcome for this group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to infer, based on the evidence of benefits (including reduction in mortality) from calcium level reduction (from surgery and from the use of cinacalcet in several hypercalcaemic states), that cinacalcet could result in clinically meaningful benefits from a calcium level reduction in people with primary hyperparathyroidism who are not deemed operable. The Subcommittee considered that, while there was limited evidence for the effect of cinacalcet on endpoints such as cardiovascular outcomes, fractures and mortality, it was reasonable to assume that a clinically significant reduction in calcium levels would be associated with improvement in these endpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>1.15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered it reasonable for cinacalcet to be funded for people with primary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypercalcemia who are not deemed operable, and have no available alternative treatments. Members noted many such patients would experience neurocognitive effects from elevated calcium. The Subcommittee considered that if funded for this population, cinacalcet would be a chronic intervention to keep calcium low and that, if tolerated and effective in reducing calcium levels, treatment with cinacalcet could be lifelong, or otherwise treatment would be discontinued.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that there was a lack of evidence to inform the frequency and management of interventions to manage acute symptomatic hypercalcaemia, which would incur clinical costs for close observation, monitoring and short-term management.

The Subcommittee considered the goal of treatment in this patient group is to reduce serum calcium levels to &lt;3.0 mmol/L (rather than reducing parathyroid hormone levels), as &lt;3.0 mmol/L is considered a \u2018safe\u2019 serum calcium level that reduces the risks of neurocognitive complications of hypercalcaemia, and of episodes of acute severe hypercalcemia.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that new evidence to inform the assessment of cinacalcet in this primary hyperparathyroidism was limited, however, members were made aware of evidence from the following publications (of which, two include cinacalcet for parathyroidectomy non-candidates which referred to hypercalcaemia with unspecified severe symptoms):</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study (audit) in Scotland of 2,598 surgical patients admitted with primary hyperparathyroidism (causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism being excluded) between 1986 to 2010 with data followed up until 2011 and including post-surgery outcomes for those who received parathyroidectomy (Collier et al. Endocr Pract. 2019;25:335-9). The Subcommittee noted that 78% of patients included were female, which the Subcommittee considered was a reasonable estimate of female prevalence in this disease.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that after follow-up, 41% of the total cohort were deceased and the standardised mortality ratio compared with the general population was 1.58, but that 42% of patients did not have surgery (either they did not meet criteria, or for other reasons), and therefore considered this group was more conservatively treated group than those in New Zealand.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the raw standardised mortality ratio compared to the general population was 1.30 in patients who received surgery (58% of the cohort) and was 1.88 in patients who were treated conservatively; after adjustment for comorbidity, the latter reduced to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.30 to 1.70; P&lt;.0001). The Subcommittee considered the conservatively treated group was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication. Based on this, the Subcommittee considered that hyperparathyroidism increases mortality compared with the general population; that surgery can reduce this mortality; and therefore, that it was reasonable to infer that cinacalcet may provide the same or similar benefit as surgery by reducing mortality by reducing serum calcium levels.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of a systematic review and meta regression of cinacalcet in primary hyperparathyroidism (Ng et al. Endocr Connect. 2020;9:724-35) which included eight trials, none of which the Subcommittee considered provided new information as all had been considered by PTAC or PTAC Subcommittees previously. The Subcommittee noted that 90% of patients had normalisation of calcium levels and 10% had normalisation of parathyroid hormone, however, no other endpoints (eg quality of life) or outcomes for mortality and morbidity were discussed in the publication.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee was made aware of an 8-year retrospective observational cohort study in Scotland of 611 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism seen in secondary care between 2006 and 2014, of which 337 patients did not receive surgery (Reid et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2019;104:3692-700). The Subcommittee noted that after an 8-year period of follow-up, the mortality rate was 16.0% (98/611) overall, with about 30% of deaths due to cancer and about 30% due to cardiovascular disease. The Subcommittee noted that 79 deaths were reported in the group who did not receive surgery. The Subcommittee noted associations between mortality and increasing age, social deprivation, and elevated adjusted calcium levels at diagnosis that were statistically significant, but no associations with parathyroid hormone levels at diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that the study population was similar to the target New Zealand population for this indication and was the most representative evidence for the target New Zealand population. The Subcommittee considered it may not be feasible to do an appropriately powered intervention study in this population.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted an observational cohort study derived from a random population sample of 750 50-year-old men in Sweden that described a 21 year follow up of men with primary hyperparathyroidism, and which did not show evidence for long term complications nor a mortality difference. The Subcommittee noted this study reported very wide confidence intervals (Kontogeorgos et al. Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2020;80:6-13).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that UpToDate suggests cinacalcet be used for patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to have surgery (whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic and/or severe hypercalcemia), and that cinacalcet would be more appropriate than bisphosphonates where bone density is normal, as supported by literature review updated in April 2021.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the previously mentioned NICE guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism in the UK and Wales (NICE, 2019) recommend cinacalcet be used for patients in whom surgery fails or is denied, to treat symptomatic patients with calcium over 2.85 mmol/L and patients with calcium levels of &gt;3.0 mmol/L with or without symptoms. Members noted that the NICE guidelines state that bisphosphonates should not be used for chronic hypercalcaemia of primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of improved mortality from secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on renal dialysis in particular, and that this comorbid population experiences high event rates and pathology-related mortality from hypercalcaemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, due to the toxicity of the parathyroid hormone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the Subcommittee considered that existing evidence for efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism is robust. The Subcommittee considered the health benefit for hypercalcaemia is based on biochemical and end-organ endpoints after surgery (which the Subcommittee considered provides strong evidence), and that there is a lack of evidence for reduced mortality in the population with primary hypercalcaemia following treatment with cinacalcet.</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that there was no new evidence of biochemical efficacy of cinacalcet in reducing serum calcium, although existing evidence for this is robust and that there was strong evidence for cinacalcet compared with surgery in normalising calcium levels (but not in reducing parathyroid hormone levels).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Summary</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a reduction in calcium to less than 3.0 mmol/L was clinically meaningful and a critical outcome for the target group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, whereas that a reduction in parathyroid hormone was not the target outcome for this group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to infer, based on the evidence of benefits (including reduction in mortality) from calcium level reduction (from surgery and from the use of cinacalcet in several hypercalcaemic states), that cinacalcet could result in clinically meaningful benefits from a calcium level reduction in people with primary hyperparathyroidism who are not deemed operable. The Subcommittee considered that, while there was limited evidence for the effect of cinacalcet on endpoints such as cardiovascular outcomes, fractures and mortality, it was reasonable to assume that a clinically significant reduction in calcium levels would be associated with improvement in these endpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>1.15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee considered it reasonable for cinacalcet to be funded for people with primary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypercalcemia who are not deemed operable, and have no available alternative treatments. Members noted many such patients would experience neurocognitive effects from elevated calcium. The Subcommittee considered that if funded for this population, cinacalcet would be a chronic intervention to keep calcium low and that, if tolerated and effective in reducing calcium levels, treatment with cinacalcet could be lifelong, or otherwise treatment would be discontinued.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>1.16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that there was a lack of evidence to inform the frequency and management of interventions to manage acute symptomatic hypercalcaemia, which would incur clinical costs for close observation, monitoring and short-term management. The Subcommittee considered that data regarding quality of life, long-term complications and hospitalisations is not available within the published clinical trial evidence and would need to be obtained from authoritative guidelines and clinician advice.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if criteria were to be applied to target funding of cinacalcet to this population with primary hyperparathyroidism, all the following would need to be incorporated: hypercalcaemia of &gt;3 mmol/L with or without symptoms, or &gt;2.85 mmol/L with symptoms; the patient is not deemed operable, or surgery has failed or is contraindicated; and the patient has other comorbidities, severe bone pain, or calciphylaxis.</p>",
