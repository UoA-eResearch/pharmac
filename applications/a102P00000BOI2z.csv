The Committee noted that the application requests widening of access to patients undergoing carboplatin-based chemotherapy, which is typically considered a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. It was noted that advice was also sought on the appropriateness of widening access to patients experiencing nausea and vomiting as a result of any moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regime. </p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that it had previously considered aprepitant for post-operative nausea and vomiting, where it recommended funding with a low priority (<a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2014-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">February 2014</a> and <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2015-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">February 2015</a>) and noted that Analgesic Subcommittee reviewed this in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-analgesic-subcommittee-minutes-2014-12-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">December 2014</a>, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted it had not previously considered aprepitant for use in carboplatin -based chemotherapy.\xa0</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) antagonist which blocks signals from NK1 receptors, decreasing the likelihood of nausea and vomiting. The Committee noted that it has not reviewed any other applications for NK1 antagonists, and that no other NK1 antagonist agents are currently funded in New Zealand with existing treatments targeting dopamine and serotonin receptors. The Committee noted that aprepitant is Medsafe approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (which would include carboplatin) and highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that highly emetogenic chemotherapies are therapies that have a 90% or greater frequency of nausea or vomiting, while moderately emetogenic chemotherapies have a 30% to 90% risk of nausea and vomiting. The Committee considered that historically emesis and nausea have not been recorded well, and an individual patient’s risk of experiencing emesis or nausea can be difficult to predict, but that treatment of gynaecological cancers is considered to be associated with increased emesis. The Committee noted that the emetogenicity of carboplatin-based chemotherapy is technically in the moderate range of 30% to 90% but considered that carboplatin falls in the higher end of this category and can be considered more emetogenic than other ‘moderate’ emetogenic chemotherapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that for highly emetogenic therapies, American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 guidelines recommend a four-drug antiemetic combination including an NK1 antagonist, a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, plus dexamethasone and olanzapine, and that for moderately emetogenic carboplatin-based chemotherapies the recommended antiemetic treatment is a combination of an NK1 antagonist, 5-HT3 antagonist, and dexamethasone (<a href=""https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-files/advocacy-and-policy/documents/Antiemetics-Emetic-Risk-Potential-1200x675.pdf"" target=""_blank"">ASCO Guidelines. Hesketh et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:2782-97</a>). The Committee noted that for moderately emetogenic chemotherapies that are not carboplatin-based, a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone (without a NK1 antagonist) is recommended. The Committee also noted that European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines recommend a combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27664248/"" target=""_blank"">Roila et al. Ann Oncol. 2016;27:v119-33</a>). </p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that carboplatin-based chemotherapy is used to treat a range of malignancies, including lung, ovarian, gastrointestinal, and uterine cancers, and that approximately 1,900 patients receive carboplatin annually. </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that cancer and the associated treatment side-effects such as nausea and vomiting is often very distressing for family, whānau and caregivers of those affected as well as patients experiencing significant nausea and vomiting as a result of treatment and considered nausea and vomiting associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy may be a barrier to cancer treatment adherence and perseverance for some patients, which may in turn exacerbate the likelihood of poorer treatment outcomes for patients, and can lead to escalation of cancer therapy to a different agent, which may be associated with an increase in toxicity and/or cost. The Committee noted that there are different phases of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; the acute phase occurring within the first 24 hours, and a delayed phase typically occurring &gt;24 hours following administration of chemotherapy. The Committee noted that some patients experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting prior to a cycle of chemotherapy, particularly if they experienced nausea and vomiting in previous cycles. </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Māori and Pacific patients are overrepresented in lung and breast cancers, with these cancers often treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that within New Zealand, the anti-emetic treatment regimen used for treatment or prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy is 8-12 mg dexamethasone on day 1 and 8 mg on days 2 and 3 after treatment, alongside 8-16 mg ondansetron one hour prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that aprepitant has a long duration of central activity, meaning that it impacts both the acute and delayed phase of emesis following chemotherapy treatment. The Committee noted that, as a CYP inhibitor, aprepitant augments the activity of 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) and dexamethasone, increasing their effect against emesis and nausea. </p><p>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of aprepitant is one dose of 125 mg immediately prior to chemotherapy, and 80 mg once daily for the two days following chemotherapy, and that this would be in addition to existing treatments of dexamethasone prior to and post chemotherapy, and ondansetron administered prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted incidentally that the benefits of aprepitant on nausea and vomiting have been reported in patients treated with cisplatin, and noted a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study performed to establish the superiority of the aprepitant regimen versus standard therapy in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14559886/"" target=""_blank"">Hesketh et al. J Clin Oncol. 2003;21:41112-9</a>). The Committee noted that the proportion of patients not experiencing emesis was higher in the aprepitant treated group in both the acute and delayed phases. The Committee considered that evidence relating to carboplatin-based chemotherapy is more relevant to this application. </p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted various studies evaluating the use of aprepitant in the treatment of emesis and nausea in patients treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy: </p><p><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27235141/"" target=""_blank"">Suzuki et al.

The Committee also noted that the complete response rates in the delayed phase were 66.7% in the first cycle (95% CI 53.7% to 78.0%) and 90.5% in the second cycle (95% CI 80.4% to 96.4%; P&lt;0.001).

The Committee considered that while this may incur additional pharmaceutical costs, there are likely to be some savings from reduction in hospital re-admissions and/or treatment of emesis; however, the Committee considered it unlikely that treatment would reduce the length of initial hospital stay associated with chemotherapy administration. The Committee considered that treatment with aprepitant is likely to improve adherence to chemotherapy treatment and may improve uptake of chemotherapy in patients who are anxious about nausea and vomiting. The Committee noted that clinical trials have not demonstrated a significant reduction in treatment adherence associated with aprepitant use, or discontinuation in those treated with placebo, but considered that this may not be representative of a real-world situation. </p><p>1.17. The Committee noted that although carboplatin-based chemotherapy is not formally considered to be ‘highly emetic, many clinicians consider it to be, and considered that the fiscal impact of funding aprepitant for this indication would be small considering the number of patients already receiving this treatment. The Committee noted that <a href=""https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/cdr/complete/cdr_complete_Emend_February-20-2008.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CADTH in Canada has recommended</a> that aprepitant be added to antiemetic treatment in the second chemotherapy cycle if nausea and vomiting are significant with highly emetogenic chemotherapies. The Committee also noted that it was unclear if aprepitant use would be more appropriate as a first- or second-line treatment, and that advice should be sought from CaTSoP regarding this. </p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if aprepitant were funded for carboplatin-based chemotherapy that this would quickly become standard of care and would likely be used in treatment naïve patients prior to their first chemotherapy cycle. The Committee considered that uptake would be close to 100%.</p><p>1.19. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there may be some benefit in widening access to allow all patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy to access aprepitant but noted that there is no evidence for this, that international guidelines do not include this in their recommendations, and that even though carboplatin is considered to be moderately emetogenic, it has been singled out as requiring extra anti-emetic treatment by some clinicians and is considered to be a highly emetogenic therapy compared to other moderately emetogenic therapies. The Committee considered that further advice from CaTSoP should be sought on cancer patient populations that would benefit from access to aprepitant. </p><p>1.20. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for aprepitant if it were to be funded in New Zealand for nausea and vomiting associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy.

The Committee noted that the emetogenicity of carboplatin-based chemotherapy is technically in the moderate range of 30% to 90% but considered that carboplatin falls in the higher end of this category and can be considered more emetogenic than other ‘moderate’ emetogenic chemotherapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that for highly emetogenic therapies, American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 guidelines recommend a four-drug antiemetic combination including an NK1 antagonist, a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, plus dexamethasone and olanzapine, and that for moderately emetogenic carboplatin-based chemotherapies the recommended antiemetic treatment is a combination of an NK1 antagonist, 5-HT3 antagonist, and dexamethasone (<a href=""https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-files/advocacy-and-policy/documents/Antiemetics-Emetic-Risk-Potential-1200x675.pdf"" target=""_blank"">ASCO Guidelines.

The Committee noted that for moderately emetogenic chemotherapies that are not carboplatin-based, a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone (without a NK1 antagonist) is recommended. The Committee also noted that European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines recommend a combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27664248/"" target=""_blank"">Roila et al.

The Committee noted that there are different phases of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; the acute phase occurring within the first 24 hours, and a delayed phase typically occurring &gt;24 hours following administration of chemotherapy. The Committee noted that some patients experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting prior to a cycle of chemotherapy, particularly if they experienced nausea and vomiting in previous cycles. </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Māori and Pacific patients are overrepresented in lung and breast cancers, with these cancers often treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that within New Zealand, the anti-emetic treatment regimen used for treatment or prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy is 8-12 mg dexamethasone on day 1 and 8 mg on days 2 and 3 after treatment, alongside 8-16 mg ondansetron one hour prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that aprepitant has a long duration of central activity, meaning that it impacts both the acute and delayed phase of emesis following chemotherapy treatment. The Committee noted that, as a CYP inhibitor, aprepitant augments the activity of 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) and dexamethasone, increasing their effect against emesis and nausea. </p><p>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of aprepitant is one dose of 125 mg immediately prior to chemotherapy, and 80 mg once daily for the two days following chemotherapy, and that this would be in addition to existing treatments of dexamethasone prior to and post chemotherapy, and ondansetron administered prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted incidentally that the benefits of aprepitant on nausea and vomiting have been reported in patients treated with cisplatin, and noted a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study performed to establish the superiority of the aprepitant regimen versus standard therapy in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14559886/"" target=""_blank"">Hesketh et al.

The Committee considered that treatment with aprepitant is likely to improve adherence to chemotherapy treatment and may improve uptake of chemotherapy in patients who are anxious about nausea and vomiting.

The Committee noted that the emetogenicity of carboplatin-based chemotherapy is technically in the moderate range of 30% to 90% but considered that carboplatin falls in the higher end of this category and can be considered more emetogenic than other ‘moderate’ emetogenic chemotherapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that for highly emetogenic therapies, American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2020 guidelines recommend a four-drug antiemetic combination including an NK1 antagonist, a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, plus dexamethasone and olanzapine, and that for moderately emetogenic carboplatin-based chemotherapies the recommended antiemetic treatment is a combination of an NK1 antagonist, 5-HT3 antagonist, and dexamethasone (<a href=""https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-files/advocacy-and-policy/documents/Antiemetics-Emetic-Risk-Potential-1200x675.pdf"" target=""_blank"">ASCO Guidelines. Hesketh et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:2782-97</a>). The Committee noted that for moderately emetogenic chemotherapies that are not carboplatin-based, a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone (without a NK1 antagonist) is recommended. The Committee also noted that European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines recommend a combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27664248/"" target=""_blank"">Roila et al.

The Committee noted that there are different phases of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; the acute phase occurring within the first 24 hours, and a delayed phase typically occurring &gt;24 hours following administration of chemotherapy. The Committee noted that some patients experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting prior to a cycle of chemotherapy, particularly if they experienced nausea and vomiting in previous cycles. </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Māori and Pacific patients are overrepresented in lung and breast cancers, with these cancers often treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that within New Zealand, the anti-emetic treatment regimen used for treatment or prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy is 8-12 mg dexamethasone on day 1 and 8 mg on days 2 and 3 after treatment, alongside 8-16 mg ondansetron one hour prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that aprepitant has a long duration of central activity, meaning that it impacts both the acute and delayed phase of emesis following chemotherapy treatment. The Committee noted that, as a CYP inhibitor, aprepitant augments the activity of 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) and dexamethasone, increasing their effect against emesis and nausea. </p><p>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of aprepitant is one dose of 125 mg immediately prior to chemotherapy, and 80 mg once daily for the two days following chemotherapy, and that this would be in addition to existing treatments of dexamethasone prior to and post chemotherapy, and ondansetron administered prior to chemotherapy. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted incidentally that the benefits of aprepitant on nausea and vomiting have been reported in patients treated with cisplatin, and noted a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study performed to establish the superiority of the aprepitant regimen versus standard therapy in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14559886/"" target=""_blank"">Hesketh et al.

The Committee considered that treatment with aprepitant is likely to improve adherence to chemotherapy treatment and may improve uptake of chemotherapy in patients who are anxious about nausea and vomiting.
