The Committee considered the impact of anticholinergic poisonings on M\u0101ori health outcomes to be significant. The Committee noted that in 2018/9 M\u0101ori comprised 21.3% of all discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines. The Committee noted that the number of discharges for M\u0101ori patients increased by an average 8% per year between 2013 and 2019, which was slightly higher than the average increase of 5% per year observed for total discharges over this same time period (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that there is a lack of published health research on the impact of toxicity on M\u0101ori health outcomes in New Zealand and consequently no further evidence has been identified in this area.</p><h2><strong>Health need</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that anticholinergic toxicity is characterised as peripheral, central, or both peripheral and central. The Committee noted that examples of classes of medications with anticholinergic properties include antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, sleep aids, cold preparations, and certain recreational drugs.\u00a0The Committee noted that other specific medications which may exhibit anticholinergic effects include benztropine, olanzapine, scopolamine, and atropine, and that significant anticholinergic toxicity has also been observed after the topical application of some eye drops, including cyclopentolate eye drops.\u00a0The Committee noted that many plants, such as jimson weed (<em>Datura stramonium</em>) and deadly nightshade (<em>Atropa belladonna</em>), may produce anticholinergic toxicity (<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning?search=anticholinergic%20toxicity&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=1#H4\" target=\"_blank\">Su et al.

The Committee noted that in 2018/9, there were 4,832 publicly funded hospital discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines in New Zealand (ICD codes T42, T43 and T44). The Committee noted that the mean length of stay for these hospitalisations ranged between 1.5 to 2.2 days and that, of the reported discharges, 3,212 (78.9%) involved female patients (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that using ICD codes as a marker of physostigmine usage will likely provide a significant overestimation of cases where antidote treatment for the poisoning is/was required. The Committee were also made aware that the New Zealand National Poisons Centre received approximately 400 phone calls regarding anticholinergic toxicity since 2017, and that 77 of these cases required toxicologist consultation. The Committee considered that discharge patterns closely reflect patient age distributions on commonly prescribed medicines with anticholinergic effects such as olanzapine, with a peak in those aged 10 to 30.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2018/9 there were 170 discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs among Pacific peoples, which represented roughly 3% of all discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs that year. The Committee noted that the number of discharges for Pacific peoples increased by an average 11% per year between 2013 and 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that this was significantly higher than the annual increases observed for total discharges of 5%. The Committee also noted that discharge numbers for Pacific peoples should be interpreted with caution due to small patient numbers.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that signs of severe anticholinergic toxicity\u00a0include effects on the central nervous system (CNS) such as anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, disorientation, visual hallucinations, bizarre behaviour, delirium, psychosis (usually paranoia), coma, and seizures. The Committee considered that patients with CNS toxicity require closer observation and more intensive care. The Committee noted that central effects often develop concomitantly with peripheral effects however may persist or manifest after peripheral effects resolve. The Committee also noted that some individuals may present with more subtle findings of anticholinergic toxicity such as confusion or an alteration in their mental state.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no current antidote for central anticholinergic toxicity available in New Zealand and considered that the current treatment paradigm is limited. The Committee considered that management of anticholinergic toxicity is based on supportive care until both peripheral and central effects of anticholinergic toxicity adequately subside. The Committee considered that neostigmine is available for treatment of anticholinergic-induced ileus in cases of anticholinergic syndrome, but as it does not cross the blood brain barrier, this will only reverse peripheral effects (TOXINZ. Anticholinergic Toxicity [accessed 5 Oct 2022]). The Committee considered that intensive monitoring over several days is required for associated life-threatening conditions such as seizures, dysrhythmias, and hyperthermia. The Committee considered that activated charcoal can be used prior to the onset of significant symptoms if ileus is not present, however the patient&#39;s psychological state may impede decontamination measures.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that benzodiazepines are used for the management of agitation, delirium, or seizures, and barbiturates may be given if seizures are refractory. The Committee considered that benzodiazepines carry a higher risk of intubation compared with using physostigmine, and have complications especially when given in high doses, as is sometimes required in anticholinergic toxicity. The Committee noted that physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic delirium, is associated with decreased agitation, less complications, and shorter recovery time compared with benzodiazepines.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that this proposal also aligns with the government priority to improve management of long-term conditions, noting that some patients with chronic mental health conditions or Parkinson\u2019s disease may be treated with anticholinergic medications and are therefore at risk of anticholinergic toxicity.</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that physostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which increases the concentration of\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0at the sites of cholinergic transmission. The Committee noted that physostigmine can reverse both central and peripheral anticholinergic symptoms as it crosses the blood-brain barrier (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Physostigmine\" target=\"_blank\">PubChem. National Centre for Biotechnology Information. Physostigmine [accessed 5 Oct 2022]</a>). The Committee noted that physostigmine is not Medsafe approved, and that regulatory approval \u00a0has not been sought from Medsafe for the requested indication.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of physostigmine in children is 0.02 mg/kg (maximum 0.5 mg) intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes, and in adults is 0.5 mg to 1 mg intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes.

The Committee noted that in 2018/9, there were 4,832 publicly funded hospital discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines in New Zealand (ICD codes T42, T43 and T44). The Committee noted that the mean length of stay for these hospitalisations ranged between 1.5 to 2.2 days and that, of the reported discharges, 3,212 (78.9%) involved female patients (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that using ICD codes as a marker of physostigmine usage will likely provide a significant overestimation of cases where antidote treatment for the poisoning is/was required. The Committee were also made aware that the New Zealand National Poisons Centre received approximately 400 phone calls regarding anticholinergic toxicity since 2017, and that 77 of these cases required toxicologist consultation. The Committee considered that discharge patterns closely reflect patient age distributions on commonly prescribed medicines with anticholinergic effects such as olanzapine, with a peak in those aged 10 to 30.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2018/9 there were 170 discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs among Pacific peoples, which represented roughly 3% of all discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs that year. The Committee noted that the number of discharges for Pacific peoples increased by an average 11% per year between 2013 and 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health.

The Committee considered that patients with CNS toxicity require closer observation and more intensive care. The Committee noted that central effects often develop concomitantly with peripheral effects however may persist or manifest after peripheral effects resolve. The Committee also noted that some individuals may present with more subtle findings of anticholinergic toxicity such as confusion or an alteration in their mental state.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no current antidote for central anticholinergic toxicity available in New Zealand and considered that the current treatment paradigm is limited. The Committee considered that management of anticholinergic toxicity is based on supportive care until both peripheral and central effects of anticholinergic toxicity adequately subside. The Committee considered that neostigmine is available for treatment of anticholinergic-induced ileus in cases of anticholinergic syndrome, but as it does not cross the blood brain barrier, this will only reverse peripheral effects (TOXINZ. Anticholinergic Toxicity [accessed 5 Oct 2022]). The Committee considered that intensive monitoring over several days is required for associated life-threatening conditions such as seizures, dysrhythmias, and hyperthermia. The Committee considered that activated charcoal can be used prior to the onset of significant symptoms if ileus is not present, however the patient&#39;s psychological state may impede decontamination measures.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that benzodiazepines are used for the management of agitation, delirium, or seizures, and barbiturates may be given if seizures are refractory. The Committee considered that benzodiazepines carry a higher risk of intubation compared with using physostigmine, and have complications especially when given in high doses, as is sometimes required in anticholinergic toxicity. The Committee noted that physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic delirium, is associated with decreased agitation, less complications, and shorter recovery time compared with benzodiazepines.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that this proposal also aligns with the government priority to improve management of long-term conditions, noting that some patients with chronic mental health conditions or Parkinson\u2019s disease may be treated with anticholinergic medications and are therefore at risk of anticholinergic toxicity.</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that physostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which increases the concentration of\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0at the sites of cholinergic transmission.

The Committee noted that physostigmine has a shorter half-life than most benzodiazepines so additional doses may be required. The Committee considered that physostigmine dose can be titrated according to the individual\u2019s response. The Committee also noted that there is also a small risk of cholinergic toxicity with use of physostigmine if the patient has not been poisoned with an anticholinergic substance.</p><h2><strong>Cost and savings</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the budget impact associated with listing physostigmine is likely to be very low. The Committee considered that, if physostigmine is listed, there may be incremental pharmaceutical and administrative costs involved in ensuring availability across relevant centres in New Zealand and replenishing expired stock. The Committee considered that physostigmine may decrease length of hospital stay and ICU time, reduce the risk of intubation, reduce risks associated with use of benzodiazepines, and thereby be associated with reductions in health sector resource use.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if listed, approximately 500 poisonings per year may be treated with physostigmine. The Committee noted that this estimate was lower than the total number of publicly funded discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines in New Zealand reported for 2018/9. The Committee considered that most anticholinergic poisonings do not cause the level of peripheral and/or central toxicity that would require treatment with physostigmine.</p><h2><strong>Funding criteria</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if physostigmine were to be funded, it is proposed that it is listed on Schedule H of the Pharmaceutical Schedule (ie the Hospital Medicines List) to be used in those exhibiting moderate to severe peripheral and central anticholinergic toxicity.</p><h2><strong>Summary for assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for physostigmine if it were to be funded in New Zealand for treatment of moderate to severe central and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity.

The Committee considered the impact of anticholinergic poisonings on M\u0101ori health outcomes to be significant. The Committee noted that in 2018/9 M\u0101ori comprised 21.3% of all discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines. The Committee noted that the number of discharges for M\u0101ori patients increased by an average 8% per year between 2013 and 2019, which was slightly higher than the average increase of 5% per year observed for total discharges over this same time period (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health.

The Committee noted that examples of classes of medications with anticholinergic properties include antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, sleep aids, cold preparations, and certain recreational drugs.\u00a0The Committee noted that other specific medications which may exhibit anticholinergic effects include benztropine, olanzapine, scopolamine, and atropine, and that significant anticholinergic toxicity has also been observed after the topical application of some eye drops, including cyclopentolate eye drops.\u00a0The Committee noted that many plants, such as jimson weed (<em>Datura stramonium</em>) and deadly nightshade (<em>Atropa belladonna</em>), may produce anticholinergic toxicity (<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning?search=anticholinergic%20toxicity&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~150&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=1#H4\" target=\"_blank\">Su et al.

The Committee noted that in 2018/9, there were 4,832 publicly funded hospital discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines in New Zealand (ICD codes T42, T43 and T44). The Committee noted that the mean length of stay for these hospitalisations ranged between 1.5 to 2.2 days and that, of the reported discharges, 3,212 (78.9%) involved female patients (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that using ICD codes as a marker of physostigmine usage will likely provide a significant overestimation of cases where antidote treatment for the poisoning is/was required. The Committee were also made aware that the New Zealand National Poisons Centre received approximately 400 phone calls regarding anticholinergic toxicity since 2017, and that 77 of these cases required toxicologist consultation. The Committee considered that discharge patterns closely reflect patient age distributions on commonly prescribed medicines with anticholinergic effects such as olanzapine, with a peak in those aged 10 to 30.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2018/9 there were 170 discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs among Pacific peoples, which represented roughly 3% of all discharges for poisonings by psychotropic drugs that year. The Committee noted that the number of discharges for Pacific peoples increased by an average 11% per year between 2013 and 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/publicly-funded-hospital-discharges-1-july-2018-30-june-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health. National Minimum Dataset. 2021</a>). The Committee noted that this was significantly higher than the annual increases observed for total discharges of 5%. The Committee also noted that discharge numbers for Pacific peoples should be interpreted with caution due to small patient numbers.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that signs of severe anticholinergic toxicity\u00a0include effects on the central nervous system (CNS) such as anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, disorientation, visual hallucinations, bizarre behaviour, delirium, psychosis (usually paranoia), coma, and seizures. The Committee considered that patients with CNS toxicity require closer observation and more intensive care. The Committee noted that central effects often develop concomitantly with peripheral effects however may persist or manifest after peripheral effects resolve. The Committee also noted that some individuals may present with more subtle findings of anticholinergic toxicity such as confusion or an alteration in their mental state.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no current antidote for central anticholinergic toxicity available in New Zealand and considered that the current treatment paradigm is limited. The Committee considered that management of anticholinergic toxicity is based on supportive care until both peripheral and central effects of anticholinergic toxicity adequately subside. The Committee considered that neostigmine is available for treatment of anticholinergic-induced ileus in cases of anticholinergic syndrome, but as it does not cross the blood brain barrier, this will only reverse peripheral effects (TOXINZ. Anticholinergic Toxicity [accessed 5 Oct 2022]). The Committee considered that intensive monitoring over several days is required for associated life-threatening conditions such as seizures, dysrhythmias, and hyperthermia. The Committee considered that activated charcoal can be used prior to the onset of significant symptoms if ileus is not present, however the patient&#39;s psychological state may impede decontamination measures.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that benzodiazepines are used for the management of agitation, delirium, or seizures, and barbiturates may be given if seizures are refractory. The Committee considered that benzodiazepines carry a higher risk of intubation compared with using physostigmine, and have complications especially when given in high doses, as is sometimes required in anticholinergic toxicity. The Committee noted that physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic delirium, is associated with decreased agitation, less complications, and shorter recovery time compared with benzodiazepines.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that this proposal also aligns with the government priority to improve management of long-term conditions, noting that some patients with chronic mental health conditions or Parkinson\u2019s disease may be treated with anticholinergic medications and are therefore at risk of anticholinergic toxicity.</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that physostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which increases the concentration of\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0at the sites of cholinergic transmission. The Committee noted that physostigmine can reverse both central and peripheral anticholinergic symptoms as it crosses the blood-brain barrier (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Physostigmine\" target=\"_blank\">PubChem. National Centre for Biotechnology Information. Physostigmine [accessed 5 Oct 2022]</a>). The Committee noted that physostigmine is not Medsafe approved, and that regulatory approval \u00a0has not been sought from Medsafe for the requested indication.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of physostigmine in children is 0.02 mg/kg (maximum 0.5 mg) intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes, and in adults is 0.5 mg to 1 mg intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes. The Committee noted that physostigmine has a relatively short duration of action of 20 to 60 minutes (though sometimes longer), and that further carefully titrated doses may be required if severe or life-threatening symptoms recur following initial clinical response. The Committee noted that additional doses should be given with caution as repeated dosing increases the risk of adverse effects. The Committee noted that strong evidence supports the contraindication to using physostigmine in tricyclic antidepressant overdose (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/em-news/fulltext/2003/05000/never_use_physostigmine_in_a_tca_overdose.30.aspx#:~:text=Strong%20evidence%20supports%20the%20contraindication,patient%20with%20a%20TCA%20overdose.\" target=\"_blank\">Schneider.

The Committee considered that the patient numbers for the two key studies were small, however that this is to be expected in this population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.11.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a double blinded, randomised controlled trial including 19 patients presenting for antimuscarinic toxidrome aged \u226510 and &lt;18 years old, with at least one central and two peripheral antimuscarinic symptoms, delirium, and moderate agitation. The Committee noted that patients were randomised to receive lorazepam (n=10) 0.05 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour normal saline infusion or physostigmine (n=9) 0.02 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour physostigmine infusion (0.02 mg/kg/h). The Committee noted that fewer patients receiving physostigmine had delirium after the initial bolus (44% vs 100%,\u00a0<em>P</em>=0.01) and at the fourth hour of infusion (22% vs 100%,\u00a0<em>P</em>&lt;0.001) compared to patients who received lorazepam. The Committee noted that there was a significant decrease in agitation scores in the physostigmine arm compared to the lorazepam arm after the initial bolus (89% vs 30%,\u00a0<em>P</em>=0.02), but no difference at the fourth hour of infusion (<em>P</em>&gt;0.99). The Committee noted that no seizures, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, intubation, or cardiac dysrhythmias were reported amongst participants (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15563650.2020.1854281\" target=\"_blank\">Wang et al.

The Committee noted that the mean total dose of treatments was physostigmine 3.9 mg (range 0.5 mg to 13.5 mg), diazepam 53.1 mg, lorazepam 35.5 mg, and midazolam 31.7 mg. The Committee noted that physostigmine controlled agitation and reversed delirium in 96% and 87% of patients, respectively. The Committee noted that benzodiazepines controlled agitation in 24% of patients but were ineffective in reversing delirium. The Committee noted that initial treatment with physostigmine resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of agitation (<em>P</em>&lt;.001) and level of\u00a0central nervous system\u00a0stimulation (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), whereas initial treatment with benzodiazepines did not (<em>P</em>=0.03 and\u00a0<em>P</em>=0.05, respectively). The Committee noted that patients treated initially with physostigmine had a significantly lower incidence of complications (7% versus 46%;\u00a0<em>P</em>&lt;.002) and a shorter time to recovery (median, 12 versus 24 hours;\u00a0<em>P</em>\u00a0=.004) than those treated initially with benzodiazepines. The Committee noted that there were no significant differences between these groups in the incidence of side effects (7% versus 14%;\u00a0<em>P</em>=0.6) and length of stay (median, 32 versus 39 hours;\u00a0<em>P</em>\u00a0=0.15) (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196-0644(00)70057-6\" target=\"_blank\">Burns et al.

The Committee noted that most patients (n=182; 95.3%) had no documented adverse effects, four patients (2.1%) experienced emesis, two experienced QTc prolongation (1.0%), two experienced seizures (1.0%), and that there was a single fatality 6 hours after physostigmine administration. The Committee noted that the average initial total doses of physostigmine ranged from 1.0 mg to 1.75 mg and that most patients were admitted to the ICU (n=110; 57.6%), however, 36 (18.8%) patients were discharged directly from the ED (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15563650.2017.1342828\" target=\"_blank\">Arens et al.

The Committee noted that physostigmine has a shorter half-life than most benzodiazepines so additional doses may be required. The Committee considered that physostigmine dose can be titrated according to the individual\u2019s response. The Committee also noted that there is also a small risk of cholinergic toxicity with use of physostigmine if the patient has not been poisoned with an anticholinergic substance.</p><h2><strong>Cost and savings</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the budget impact associated with listing physostigmine is likely to be very low. The Committee considered that, if physostigmine is listed, there may be incremental pharmaceutical and administrative costs involved in ensuring availability across relevant centres in New Zealand and replenishing expired stock. The Committee considered that physostigmine may decrease length of hospital stay and ICU time, reduce the risk of intubation, reduce risks associated with use of benzodiazepines, and thereby be associated with reductions in health sector resource use.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if listed, approximately 500 poisonings per year may be treated with physostigmine. The Committee noted that this estimate was lower than the total number of publicly funded discharges for poisonings by psychotropic medicines in New Zealand reported for 2018/9. The Committee considered that most anticholinergic poisonings do not cause the level of peripheral and/or central toxicity that would require treatment with physostigmine.</p><h2><strong>Funding criteria</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if physostigmine were to be funded, it is proposed that it is listed on Schedule H of the Pharmaceutical Schedule (ie the Hospital Medicines List) to be used in those exhibiting moderate to severe peripheral and central anticholinergic toxicity.</p><h2><strong>Summary for assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for physostigmine if it were to be funded in New Zealand for treatment of moderate to severe central and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
