The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2019</a>, CaTSoP recommended that daratumumab in combination with bortezomib &amp; dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma be listed within the context of treatment of malignancy, with a low priority.

The Subcommittee noted that the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG) had expressed its preference for daratumumab to be funded as a subcutaneous formulation rather than intravenous.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 protein expressed at a high level on the surface of myeloma tumour cells and has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the health need of this patient population has been previously described by CaTSoP at recent meetings, including its <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2021</a> meeting and by the NZMIG. In particular, the Subcommittee noted that patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed after, or is refractory to, first-line therapy have an unmet health need because current second-line treatment options for this disease are unable to provide significant delays in disease progression and patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant would receive all effective funded treatment options in their first treatment line, noting that this would leave them without any new, effective therapies available for treatment of relapsed/refractory disease and gaining minimal benefit (if any) from retreatment with previously used therapies or remaining options (eg thalidomide).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care treatment options in New Zealand are not aligned with international guidelines and that several additional options for use in second-line or later lines of treatment are available internationally (eg daratumumab, carfilzomib and pomalidomide, as well as other agents not previously considered by CaTSoP).</p><p><i>Intravenous daratumumab</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that intravenous daratumumab is given at a dose of 16 mg per kg, weekly for cycles one to three, then every three weeks for cycles four to eight, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, then every four weeks until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided evidence that daratumumab infusion durations vary, with a patient’s first infusion generally taking seven hours; the second infusion taking four hours and subsequent infusions being given over about three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, as previously discussed, daratumumab infusion over a 90-minute period is feasible, according to a rapid infusion protocol (as described on the NSW Government’s cancer treatment protocol website, <a href=""https://www.eviq.org.au/haematology-and-bmt/multiple-myeloma/3611-multiple-myeloma-dvd-daratumumab-bortezomib"" target=""_blank"">eviQ.org.au</a>) although this regimen is not present on the Medsafe data sheet. The Subcommittee considered that anecdotal reports of this rapid infusion protocol (used where daratumumab is made available for compassionate use in New Zealand) provided some evidence for its safety, efficacy and suitability. However, the Subcommittee considered that even if a rapid protocol were used, intravenous daratumumab would substantially impact infusion services.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> CaTSoP reviewed updated, unpublished information from the phase III CASTOR trial that included 498 patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy and were not refractory to prior bortezomib. These patients\xa0were randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous daratumumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) until disease progression (bortezomib and dexamethasone, Vd, for eight cycles) or\xa0Vd for eight cycles alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CASTOR reported PFS outcomes for the intention-to-treat population, which included patients who received one prior line, two to three prior lines and more than three prior lines of therapy (unpublished data) reporting PFS of 16.7 months DVd compared with 7.1 months Vd (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.40; <i>p&lt;</i>0.0001) and reported PFS for the subgroup who had received only one prior line of treatment, as above.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the one prior line subgroup aligned well with the New Zealand patient population who would be suitable candidates for DVd and who have a significant unmet need, of which about 70% or more would have had prior bortezomib exposure.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier-provided evidence for intravenous daratumumab suggested that the greatest benefit from the addition of daratumumab occurs in patients who have received one prior line of treatment, rather than in later lines of treatment, and that this was likely due to earlier treatment when the disease is more chemotherapy-sensitive. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of treatment would reduce if used in later lines of treatment, as has been seen for other novel agents.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that similar outcomes to trial population would be expected in the corresponding New Zealand relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma population, although noted that the standard of care treatment for most of these patients would consist of bortezomib, dexamethasone and thalidomide which may provide slightly better outcomes than the bortezomib and dexamethasone trial comparator.</p><p><br></p><p>In relation to the cross-trial comparison of CASTOR (DVd) and ENDEAVOR (carfilzomib with dexamethasone, Kd) as previously discussed in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> (para. 4.24), the Subcommittee reiterated that the trials appear to have similar patient populations with control arms receiving the same treatment regimen. However, the Subcommittee considered that these trials were not ideal for comparison of survival outcomes due to confounding effects (eg. uncertainty regarding subsequent treatment lines) and a non-significant reduction in risk of death from the ENDEAVOR trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier’s cross-trial comparison provided low-quality evidence regarding the claim of improved survival with intravenous daratumumab compared with carfilzomib.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Subcutaneous daratumumab</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is available as a vial containing 1800 mg per 15 mL and once constituted, it can be kept refrigerated for 24 hours protected from light then for 15 hours at room temperature with ambient room light. Members considered that administration of the subcutaneous daratumumab in the community may be challenging due to its relatively short expiry time and large volume.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is proposed to be administered as a flat dose of 1800 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone weekly for weeks one to nine, then every three weeks for weeks ten to 24, and then as a monotherapy every four weeks until disease progression.

The Subcommittee acknowledged that there is no direct evidence comparing subcutaneous daratumumab with Vd, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to suggest that efficacy outcomes with subcutaneous daratumumab would be any different to those with intravenous daratumumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the CASTOR trial population, which excluded patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib, was consistent with funding recommendations for IV and SC daratumumab in international jurisdictions. However, the Subcommittee considered that funding either formulation only for patients with prior bortezomib response may create an unmet need in patients with disease refractory to or intolerant of bortezomib. The Subcommittee considered that this would compound the inequity for those patients who have not previously benefitted from a bortezomib containing treatment regimen in first line. Members considered however that such patients could reasonably benefit from daratumumab without use in combination with bortezomib because daratumumab has a different mechanism of action to current first-line treatments. However, Members noted that the evidence of response with daratumumab in the absence of bortezomib was lower than in combination with bortezomib, but acknowledged that the evidence supporting this was from patient populations with varying degrees of pre-treatment. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to enable access to daratumumab for those bortezomib-refractory/intolerant patients based on the likely efficacy of daratumumab in this patient group and the unmet need that would arise of daratumumab were funded for only bortezomib responsive patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that some patient subgroups are unable to access effective treatment options such as the 10-20% of autologous stem cell transplant-eligible patients who did not receive a sufficient response to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD), noting that at least a partial response is desirable before transplant. The Subcommittee further considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib-containing regimen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of daratumumab (IV or SC, as DVd) was hard to establish relative to regimens used internationally for second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (ie carfilzomib/dexamethasone, carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone, pomalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone and pomalidomide/dexamethasone). The Subcommittee noted that this is because not even published indirect comparisons such as network meta-analysis exist for these comparisons, let alone direct comparisons. The Subcommittee also noted that it is not feasible to accurately compare outcomes across their corresponding trials, which lack direct comparability (eg due to different trial designs and patient populations). The Subcommittee considered however, that all of these regimens are considerably more efficacious than currently funded second-line treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab (as DVd) was a generally well-tolerated regimen with tolerability similar to that of pomalidomide (PVd), both of which were considered to be less toxic than carfilzomib, but overall considered that less toxicity occurs with daratumumab. As recorded in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a>, the Subcommittee considered that daratumumab may be a more suitable option for treatment of elderly or frail patients who might otherwise not be able to receive a more toxic therapy such as carfilzomib which is associated with cardiac toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that the reduced infusion risk with daratumumab SC alleviates a substantial treatment-related risk in this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that treatment with daratumumab requires pan-antigen matched blood in case blood transfusion is needed, although members considered that not all patients require a transfusion during second-line treatment and that this is likely manageable by blood banks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that many patients would have second-line treatment with bortezomib as a SC injection administered at an infusion service, and noted that self administration and community administration of bortezomib is possible for some, but not all, patients. The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care is administered until maximum response and is then discontinued. The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab SC would require additional infusional resources. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce the feasibility of self-administration and community administration, and therefore administration of daratumumab SC may require ongoing treatment in hospital. The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab SC may be challenging to self administer because of the 15 ml volume of the subcutaneous injection, possibly requiring multiple injections per dose. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce feasibility of self administration in the community. The Subcommittee considered that ongoing use of daratumumab until disease progression would lead to an ongoing infusion requirement, in comparison to current standard of care, which is discontinued once maximum response is obtained. The Subcommittee considered that the subcutaneous formulation would reduce access inequities, based on chair time, however, it may not fully address inequities as patient travel is still required for access to treatment even if onsite treatment time is shorter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the treatment time, infusion burden and infusion administration costs of daratumumab SC are minimal (three to five minutes per injection) compared with the significant IV infusion requirements for carfilzomib (about 20 hours per year if using ARROW protocol dosing 70 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> once weekly, for three out of every four weeks per cycle) or monoclonal antibody treatment (eg daratumumab IV, three to seven hours depending on cycle [approximately 70 hours in year one and 40 hours each subsequent year], or 90 minutes per infusion if using the rapid treatment protocol [approximately 40 hours in year one and 20 hours each subsequent year]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the option to use the 90-minute rapid protocol could substantially reduce the infusion impact of daratumumab IV, but that this would remain a substantial impact on the infusion service resource.

The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2019</a>, CaTSoP recommended that daratumumab in combination with bortezomib &amp; dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma be listed within the context of treatment of malignancy, with a low priority. The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a>, CaTSoP reiterated its previous recommendation following review of updated information from the CASTOR trial that was provided by the supplier, and at that time, the Subcommittee noted that intravenous daratumumab would be associated with a large, costly, infusion burden.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CaTSoP had considered several different medicines for the second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, including carfilzomib and pomalidomide, in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2021</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac had received a new application for subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one prior line of myeloma therapy in April 2021. The Subcommittee noted that the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG) had expressed its preference for daratumumab to be funded as a subcutaneous formulation rather than intravenous.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 protein expressed at a high level on the surface of myeloma tumour cells and has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the health need of this patient population has been previously described by CaTSoP at recent meetings, including its <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2021</a> meeting and by the NZMIG. In particular, the Subcommittee noted that patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed after, or is refractory to, first-line therapy have an unmet health need because current second-line treatment options for this disease are unable to provide significant delays in disease progression and patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant would receive all effective funded treatment options in their first treatment line, noting that this would leave them without any new, effective therapies available for treatment of relapsed/refractory disease and gaining minimal benefit (if any) from retreatment with previously used therapies or remaining options (eg thalidomide).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care treatment options in New Zealand are not aligned with international guidelines and that several additional options for use in second-line or later lines of treatment are available internationally (eg daratumumab, carfilzomib and pomalidomide, as well as other agents not previously considered by CaTSoP).</p><p><i>Intravenous daratumumab</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that intravenous daratumumab is given at a dose of 16 mg per kg, weekly for cycles one to three, then every three weeks for cycles four to eight, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, then every four weeks until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided evidence that daratumumab infusion durations vary, with a patient’s first infusion generally taking seven hours; the second infusion taking four hours and subsequent infusions being given over about three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, as previously discussed, daratumumab infusion over a 90-minute period is feasible, according to a rapid infusion protocol (as described on the NSW Government’s cancer treatment protocol website, <a href=""https://www.eviq.org.au/haematology-and-bmt/multiple-myeloma/3611-multiple-myeloma-dvd-daratumumab-bortezomib"" target=""_blank"">eviQ.org.au</a>) although this regimen is not present on the Medsafe data sheet. The Subcommittee considered that anecdotal reports of this rapid infusion protocol (used where daratumumab is made available for compassionate use in New Zealand) provided some evidence for its safety, efficacy and suitability. However, the Subcommittee considered that even if a rapid protocol were used, intravenous daratumumab would substantially impact infusion services.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> CaTSoP reviewed updated, unpublished information from the phase III CASTOR trial that included 498 patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy and were not refractory to prior bortezomib. These patients\xa0were randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous daratumumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) until disease progression (bortezomib and dexamethasone, Vd, for eight cycles) or\xa0Vd for eight cycles alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CASTOR reported PFS outcomes for the intention-to-treat population, which included patients who received one prior line, two to three prior lines and more than three prior lines of therapy (unpublished data) reporting PFS of 16.7 months DVd compared with 7.1 months Vd (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.40; <i>p&lt;</i>0.0001) and reported PFS for the subgroup who had received only one prior line of treatment, as above.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the one prior line subgroup aligned well with the New Zealand patient population who would be suitable candidates for DVd and who have a significant unmet need, of which about 70% or more would have had prior bortezomib exposure.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier-provided evidence for intravenous daratumumab suggested that the greatest benefit from the addition of daratumumab occurs in patients who have received one prior line of treatment, rather than in later lines of treatment, and that this was likely due to earlier treatment when the disease is more chemotherapy-sensitive. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of treatment would reduce if used in later lines of treatment, as has been seen for other novel agents.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that similar outcomes to trial population would be expected in the corresponding New Zealand relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma population, although noted that the standard of care treatment for most of these patients would consist of bortezomib, dexamethasone and thalidomide which may provide slightly better outcomes than the bortezomib and dexamethasone trial comparator.</p><p><br></p><p>In relation to the cross-trial comparison of CASTOR (DVd) and ENDEAVOR (carfilzomib with dexamethasone, Kd) as previously discussed in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> (para. 4.24), the Subcommittee reiterated that the trials appear to have similar patient populations with control arms receiving the same treatment regimen. However, the Subcommittee considered that these trials were not ideal for comparison of survival outcomes due to confounding effects (eg. uncertainty regarding subsequent treatment lines) and a non-significant reduction in risk of death from the ENDEAVOR trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier’s cross-trial comparison provided low-quality evidence regarding the claim of improved survival with intravenous daratumumab compared with carfilzomib.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Subcutaneous daratumumab</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is available as a vial containing 1800 mg per 15 mL and once constituted, it can be kept refrigerated for 24 hours protected from light then for 15 hours at room temperature with ambient room light. Members considered that administration of the subcutaneous daratumumab in the community may be challenging due to its relatively short expiry time and large volume.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is proposed to be administered as a flat dose of 1800 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone weekly for weeks one to nine, then every three weeks for weeks ten to 24, and then as a monotherapy every four weeks until disease progression. The Subcommittee noted that bortezomib and dexamethasone are administered on a three-weekly cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Medsafe approved subcutaneous daratumumab in May 2021 for the following indications:</p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Adult patients (18 years and over) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma:</span></p><ul><li><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, for use in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, for use in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone, or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Adult patients (18 years and over) with multiple myeloma who have received:</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">At least one prior therapy, for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">At least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are refractory to both a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, for use as monotherapy.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence for the use of subcutaneous daratumumab comes from the COLUMBA monotherapy trial which used intravenous daratumumab as comparator and included 522 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352-3026(20)30070-3"" target=""_blank"">Mateos et al.

The Subcommittee acknowledged that there is no direct evidence comparing subcutaneous daratumumab with Vd, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to suggest that efficacy outcomes with subcutaneous daratumumab would be any different to those with intravenous daratumumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the CASTOR trial population, which excluded patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib, was consistent with funding recommendations for IV and SC daratumumab in international jurisdictions. However, the Subcommittee considered that funding either formulation only for patients with prior bortezomib response may create an unmet need in patients with disease refractory to or intolerant of bortezomib. The Subcommittee considered that this would compound the inequity for those patients who have not previously benefitted from a bortezomib containing treatment regimen in first line. Members considered however that such patients could reasonably benefit from daratumumab without use in combination with bortezomib because daratumumab has a different mechanism of action to current first-line treatments. However, Members noted that the evidence of response with daratumumab in the absence of bortezomib was lower than in combination with bortezomib, but acknowledged that the evidence supporting this was from patient populations with varying degrees of pre-treatment. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to enable access to daratumumab for those bortezomib-refractory/intolerant patients based on the likely efficacy of daratumumab in this patient group and the unmet need that would arise of daratumumab were funded for only bortezomib responsive patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that some patient subgroups are unable to access effective treatment options such as the 10-20% of autologous stem cell transplant-eligible patients who did not receive a sufficient response to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD), noting that at least a partial response is desirable before transplant. The Subcommittee further considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib-containing regimen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of daratumumab (IV or SC, as DVd) was hard to establish relative to regimens used internationally for second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (ie carfilzomib/dexamethasone, carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone, pomalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone and pomalidomide/dexamethasone). The Subcommittee noted that this is because not even published indirect comparisons such as network meta-analysis exist for these comparisons, let alone direct comparisons. The Subcommittee also noted that it is not feasible to accurately compare outcomes across their corresponding trials, which lack direct comparability (eg due to different trial designs and patient populations). The Subcommittee considered however, that all of these regimens are considerably more efficacious than currently funded second-line treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab (as DVd) was a generally well-tolerated regimen with tolerability similar to that of pomalidomide (PVd), both of which were considered to be less toxic than carfilzomib, but overall considered that less toxicity occurs with daratumumab. As recorded in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a>, the Subcommittee considered that daratumumab may be a more suitable option for treatment of elderly or frail patients who might otherwise not be able to receive a more toxic therapy such as carfilzomib which is associated with cardiac toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that the reduced infusion risk with daratumumab SC alleviates a substantial treatment-related risk in this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that treatment with daratumumab requires pan-antigen matched blood in case blood transfusion is needed, although members considered that not all patients require a transfusion during second-line treatment and that this is likely manageable by blood banks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that many patients would have second-line treatment with bortezomib as a SC injection administered at an infusion service, and noted that self administration and community administration of bortezomib is possible for some, but not all, patients. The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care is administered until maximum response and is then discontinued. The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab SC would require additional infusional resources. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce the feasibility of self-administration and community administration, and therefore administration of daratumumab SC may require ongoing treatment in hospital. The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab SC may be challenging to self administer because of the 15 ml volume of the subcutaneous injection, possibly requiring multiple injections per dose. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce feasibility of self administration in the community. The Subcommittee considered that ongoing use of daratumumab until disease progression would lead to an ongoing infusion requirement, in comparison to current standard of care, which is discontinued once maximum response is obtained. The Subcommittee considered that the subcutaneous formulation would reduce access inequities, based on chair time, however, it may not fully address inequities as patient travel is still required for access to treatment even if onsite treatment time is shorter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the treatment time, infusion burden and infusion administration costs of daratumumab SC are minimal (three to five minutes per injection) compared with the significant IV infusion requirements for carfilzomib (about 20 hours per year if using ARROW protocol dosing 70 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> once weekly, for three out of every four weeks per cycle) or monoclonal antibody treatment (eg daratumumab IV, three to seven hours depending on cycle [approximately 70 hours in year one and 40 hours each subsequent year], or 90 minutes per infusion if using the rapid treatment protocol [approximately 40 hours in year one and 20 hours each subsequent year]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the option to use the 90-minute rapid protocol could substantially reduce the infusion impact of daratumumab IV, but that this would remain a substantial impact on the infusion service resource. The Subcommittee considered that cannulation required for IV treatment takes time and can become more difficult over time. The Subcommittee considered that the health system impact for daratumumab SC as DVd would be slightly more than that of PVd, given pomalidomide is an oral therapy that doesn’t have the same infusion impact, noting that daratumumab SC would still require infusion day resource for maintenance dosing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is individual variation in treatment response with this disease. Members considered that, if daratumumab (IV or SC) were funded for second-line treatment, that transplant-ineligible patients would likely be offered lenalidomide third-line, and transplant-eligible patients (who would have previously received lenalidomide maintenance and have received bortezomib first- and second-line) may be offered either carfilzomib (Kd) or pomalidomide (PVd), if funded, as lenalidomide is no longer accessible in the relapsed/refractory setting since its funding as first line maintenance therapy.

The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2019</a>, CaTSoP recommended that daratumumab in combination with bortezomib &amp; dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma be listed within the context of treatment of malignancy, with a low priority. The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a>, CaTSoP reiterated its previous recommendation following review of updated information from the CASTOR trial that was provided by the supplier, and at that time, the Subcommittee noted that intravenous daratumumab would be associated with a large, costly, infusion burden.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CaTSoP had considered several different medicines for the second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, including carfilzomib and pomalidomide, in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2021</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac had received a new application for subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one prior line of myeloma therapy in April 2021. The Subcommittee noted that the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG) had expressed its preference for daratumumab to be funded as a subcutaneous formulation rather than intravenous.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 protein expressed at a high level on the surface of myeloma tumour cells and has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the health need of this patient population has been previously described by CaTSoP at recent meetings, including its <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-04-12-Cancer-Treatment-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2021</a> meeting and by the NZMIG. In particular, the Subcommittee noted that patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed after, or is refractory to, first-line therapy have an unmet health need because current second-line treatment options for this disease are unable to provide significant delays in disease progression and patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant would receive all effective funded treatment options in their first treatment line, noting that this would leave them without any new, effective therapies available for treatment of relapsed/refractory disease and gaining minimal benefit (if any) from retreatment with previously used therapies or remaining options (eg thalidomide).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care treatment options in New Zealand are not aligned with international guidelines and that several additional options for use in second-line or later lines of treatment are available internationally (eg daratumumab, carfilzomib and pomalidomide, as well as other agents not previously considered by CaTSoP).</p><p><i>Intravenous daratumumab</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that intravenous daratumumab is given at a dose of 16 mg per kg, weekly for cycles one to three, then every three weeks for cycles four to eight, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, then every four weeks until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided evidence that daratumumab infusion durations vary, with a patient’s first infusion generally taking seven hours; the second infusion taking four hours and subsequent infusions being given over about three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, as previously discussed, daratumumab infusion over a 90-minute period is feasible, according to a rapid infusion protocol (as described on the NSW Government’s cancer treatment protocol website, <a href=""https://www.eviq.org.au/haematology-and-bmt/multiple-myeloma/3611-multiple-myeloma-dvd-daratumumab-bortezomib"" target=""_blank"">eviQ.org.au</a>) although this regimen is not present on the Medsafe data sheet. The Subcommittee considered that anecdotal reports of this rapid infusion protocol (used where daratumumab is made available for compassionate use in New Zealand) provided some evidence for its safety, efficacy and suitability. However, the Subcommittee considered that even if a rapid protocol were used, intravenous daratumumab would substantially impact infusion services.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> CaTSoP reviewed updated, unpublished information from the phase III CASTOR trial that included 498 patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy and were not refractory to prior bortezomib. These patients\xa0were randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous daratumumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) until disease progression (bortezomib and dexamethasone, Vd, for eight cycles) or\xa0Vd for eight cycles alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that CASTOR reported PFS outcomes for the intention-to-treat population, which included patients who received one prior line, two to three prior lines and more than three prior lines of therapy (unpublished data) reporting PFS of 16.7 months DVd compared with 7.1 months Vd (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.40; <i>p&lt;</i>0.0001) and reported PFS for the subgroup who had received only one prior line of treatment, as above.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the one prior line subgroup aligned well with the New Zealand patient population who would be suitable candidates for DVd and who have a significant unmet need, of which about 70% or more would have had prior bortezomib exposure.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier-provided evidence for intravenous daratumumab suggested that the greatest benefit from the addition of daratumumab occurs in patients who have received one prior line of treatment, rather than in later lines of treatment, and that this was likely due to earlier treatment when the disease is more chemotherapy-sensitive. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of treatment would reduce if used in later lines of treatment, as has been seen for other novel agents.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that similar outcomes to trial population would be expected in the corresponding New Zealand relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma population, although noted that the standard of care treatment for most of these patients would consist of bortezomib, dexamethasone and thalidomide which may provide slightly better outcomes than the bortezomib and dexamethasone trial comparator.</p><p><br></p><p>In relation to the cross-trial comparison of CASTOR (DVd) and ENDEAVOR (carfilzomib with dexamethasone, Kd) as previously discussed in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a> (para. 4.24), the Subcommittee reiterated that the trials appear to have similar patient populations with control arms receiving the same treatment regimen. However, the Subcommittee considered that these trials were not ideal for comparison of survival outcomes due to confounding effects (eg. uncertainty regarding subsequent treatment lines) and a non-significant reduction in risk of death from the ENDEAVOR trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the supplier’s cross-trial comparison provided low-quality evidence regarding the claim of improved survival with intravenous daratumumab compared with carfilzomib.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Subcutaneous daratumumab</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is available as a vial containing 1800 mg per 15 mL and once constituted, it can be kept refrigerated for 24 hours protected from light then for 15 hours at room temperature with ambient room light. Members considered that administration of the subcutaneous daratumumab in the community may be challenging due to its relatively short expiry time and large volume.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subcutaneous daratumumab is proposed to be administered as a flat dose of 1800 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone weekly for weeks one to nine, then every three weeks for weeks ten to 24, and then as a monotherapy every four weeks until disease progression. The Subcommittee noted that bortezomib and dexamethasone are administered on a three-weekly cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Medsafe approved subcutaneous daratumumab in May 2021 for the following indications:</p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Adult patients (18 years and over) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma:</span></p><ul><li><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, for use in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, for use in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone, or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Adult patients (18 years and over) with multiple myeloma who have received:</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">At least one prior therapy, for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone</span></li><li><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">At least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are refractory to both a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, for use as monotherapy.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence for the use of subcutaneous daratumumab comes from the COLUMBA monotherapy trial which used intravenous daratumumab as comparator and included 522 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352-3026(20)30070-3"" target=""_blank"">Mateos et al.

The Subcommittee acknowledged that there is no direct evidence comparing subcutaneous daratumumab with Vd, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to suggest that efficacy outcomes with subcutaneous daratumumab would be any different to those with intravenous daratumumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the CASTOR trial population, which excluded patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib, was consistent with funding recommendations for IV and SC daratumumab in international jurisdictions. However, the Subcommittee considered that funding either formulation only for patients with prior bortezomib response may create an unmet need in patients with disease refractory to or intolerant of bortezomib. The Subcommittee considered that this would compound the inequity for those patients who have not previously benefitted from a bortezomib containing treatment regimen in first line. Members considered however that such patients could reasonably benefit from daratumumab without use in combination with bortezomib because daratumumab has a different mechanism of action to current first-line treatments. However, Members noted that the evidence of response with daratumumab in the absence of bortezomib was lower than in combination with bortezomib, but acknowledged that the evidence supporting this was from patient populations with varying degrees of pre-treatment. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to enable access to daratumumab for those bortezomib-refractory/intolerant patients based on the likely efficacy of daratumumab in this patient group and the unmet need that would arise of daratumumab were funded for only bortezomib responsive patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that some patient subgroups are unable to access effective treatment options such as the 10-20% of autologous stem cell transplant-eligible patients who did not receive a sufficient response to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD), noting that at least a partial response is desirable before transplant. The Subcommittee further considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib-containing regimen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of daratumumab (IV or SC, as DVd) was hard to establish relative to regimens used internationally for second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (ie carfilzomib/dexamethasone, carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone, pomalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone and pomalidomide/dexamethasone). The Subcommittee noted that this is because not even published indirect comparisons such as network meta-analysis exist for these comparisons, let alone direct comparisons. The Subcommittee also noted that it is not feasible to accurately compare outcomes across their corresponding trials, which lack direct comparability (eg due to different trial designs and patient populations). The Subcommittee considered however, that all of these regimens are considerably more efficacious than currently funded second-line treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab (as DVd) was a generally well-tolerated regimen with tolerability similar to that of pomalidomide (PVd), both of which were considered to be less toxic than carfilzomib, but overall considered that less toxicity occurs with daratumumab. As recorded in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-10-Cancer-Treatment-Subcommittee-Record-published-25-February-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2020</a>, the Subcommittee considered that daratumumab may be a more suitable option for treatment of elderly or frail patients who might otherwise not be able to receive a more toxic therapy such as carfilzomib which is associated with cardiac toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that the reduced infusion risk with daratumumab SC alleviates a substantial treatment-related risk in this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that treatment with daratumumab requires pan-antigen matched blood in case blood transfusion is needed, although members considered that not all patients require a transfusion during second-line treatment and that this is likely manageable by blood banks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that many patients would have second-line treatment with bortezomib as a SC injection administered at an infusion service, and noted that self administration and community administration of bortezomib is possible for some, but not all, patients. The Subcommittee noted that current standard of care is administered until maximum response and is then discontinued. The Subcommittee noted that daratumumab SC would require additional infusional resources. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce the feasibility of self-administration and community administration, and therefore administration of daratumumab SC may require ongoing treatment in hospital. The Subcommittee considered that daratumumab SC may be challenging to self administer because of the 15 ml volume of the subcutaneous injection, possibly requiring multiple injections per dose. The Subcommittee considered that the short expiry would also reduce feasibility of self administration in the community. The Subcommittee considered that ongoing use of daratumumab until disease progression would lead to an ongoing infusion requirement, in comparison to current standard of care, which is discontinued once maximum response is obtained. The Subcommittee considered that the subcutaneous formulation would reduce access inequities, based on chair time, however, it may not fully address inequities as patient travel is still required for access to treatment even if onsite treatment time is shorter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the treatment time, infusion burden and infusion administration costs of daratumumab SC are minimal (three to five minutes per injection) compared with the significant IV infusion requirements for carfilzomib (about 20 hours per year if using ARROW protocol dosing 70 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span> once weekly, for three out of every four weeks per cycle) or monoclonal antibody treatment (eg daratumumab IV, three to seven hours depending on cycle [approximately 70 hours in year one and 40 hours each subsequent year], or 90 minutes per infusion if using the rapid treatment protocol [approximately 40 hours in year one and 20 hours each subsequent year]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the option to use the 90-minute rapid protocol could substantially reduce the infusion impact of daratumumab IV, but that this would remain a substantial impact on the infusion service resource. The Subcommittee considered that cannulation required for IV treatment takes time and can become more difficult over time. The Subcommittee considered that the health system impact for daratumumab SC as DVd would be slightly more than that of PVd, given pomalidomide is an oral therapy that doesn’t have the same infusion impact, noting that daratumumab SC would still require infusion day resource for maintenance dosing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is individual variation in treatment response with this disease. Members considered that, if daratumumab (IV or SC) were funded for second-line treatment, that transplant-ineligible patients would likely be offered lenalidomide third-line, and transplant-eligible patients (who would have previously received lenalidomide maintenance and have received bortezomib first- and second-line) may be offered either carfilzomib (Kd) or pomalidomide (PVd), if funded, as lenalidomide is no longer accessible in the relapsed/refractory setting since its funding as first line maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that reserving daratumumab for use in a later line would mean missing out on its expected benefit in the second line setting. However, members noted that the NZMIG may have a different view of treatment sequencing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the high cost of daratumumab SC and IV, with the high additional cost to health system for infusion of the IV treatment. The Subcommittee considered that biosimilar competition was an important factor when considering the funding of either formulation. The Subcommittee considered that in the absence of biosimilar competition the preferred treatment out of the two daratumumab formulations would be daratumumab SC. The Subcommittee considered that if the SC formulation were funded there would be a greater benefit to the health system from the lower infusion resource requirements. Members considered that subsequently changing a funded product from an SC formulation to an IV formulation would be challenging given the substantial resource impact and patient preference/expectation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if daratumumab were funded in the relapsed/refractory setting, reconsideration regarding access to other treatments (eg. lenalidomide) would be required. The Subcommittee noted that evidence was emerging regarding the use of novel agents in combination with funded and unfunded treatments and that it would be important to ensure that new treatments were funded in combination with only those treatments where a positive recommendation had been obtained.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for daratumumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for second-line treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0</p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000007OLE0&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001djBa"" alt=""5.PNG""></img></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000DPUuQAO'}, 'change': None}]",Nov 2017,False,True

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
