The Subcommittee considered that at the time there was significant uncertainty regarding whether elosulfase alfa would provide substantial long-term benefit in all patients with MPS IVA, due to the heterogeneity of the disease and variable age at treatment onset.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health need</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MPS IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome, is a rare, severe, and debilitating inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which is an enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). The Committee noted that with insufficient GALNS, GAGs and other secondary storage compounds progressively accumulate in multiple body organs and tissues.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is a wide spectrum of disease severity associated with MPS IVA. The Committee noted that the severe clinical manifestations of MPS IVA may lead to premature death (with a mean age of death reported to be 25.3 +/- 17.4 years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270860/\" target=\"_blank\">Lavery et al, JIMD Rep. 2015;15:59-66</a>). The Committee considered that these early deaths commonly occur from cardio-respiratory complications (obstructive and restrictive lung disease) and central nervous system complications relating to cervical spinal cord compression. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently 5 diagnosed cases of MPS IVA in New Zealand. The Committee considered it was possible, but unlikely, that there were more <span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">prevalent </span>cases, as<span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> </span>individuals with MPS IVA are unlikely to remain undiagnosed due to the severity of their symptoms.

The Committee noted that the skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities as well as impaired respiratory function contribute to patients\u2019 restricted mobility.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that current management of patients with MPS IVA is focused on addressing the symptoms of the disease, often including orthopaedic operations and analgesic medication for musculoskeletal symptoms and complications. Vaccination and aggressive treatments against respiratory infections are recommended, and respiratory surgeries including tonsillectomy are frequently required.

The Committee considered that the severe health needs of individuals with MPS IVA are likely to have a high emotional and psychological impact on their families and there a likely associated considerable strain on caregivers. The Committee noted one study that explored quality of life for carers of people with MPS that concluded caregivers may face strains (such as attending medical appointments with individuals with MPS IVA, and assisting with daily tasks such as toileting, dressing, or travelling to school or work) which affect their health and well-being (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2326409815613804\" target=\"_blank\">Guarany et al.

The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs, KS and C6S. The Committee noted that cell uptake of elosulfase alfa into lysosomes is through cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated internalisation leading to restored GALNS activity and clearance of KS.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Vimizim is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome in children and adults of all ages. The Committee noted that the recommended dosage of elosulfase alfa is 2 mg/kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion once a week, and that the total volume of the infusion should be delivered over no less than 4 hours.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that treatment should start as early as possible after diagnosis, ideally before the appearance of non-reversible clinical manifestations of the disease. The Committee noted that MPS IVA is a chronic condition, and considered that treatment with elosulfase alfa would continue for an indefinite length of time.\u00a0</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA has been used internationally for several years. The Committee noted data from the multicentre, multinational, observational Morquio A Registry Study (MARS)which provides 6-year treatment data for elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-</a>72). The Committee noted the MARS data included 323 patients across 65 clinical sites in 17 countries. The Committee noted the mean age at treatment initiation was 14 years, and that the mean length of treatment exposure was 5.5 years. </p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the MARS study reported that the mean change from baseline for the six-minute walk test (6MWT) was -6.1 metres (95% CI: \u221227.6, 15.5) over 5.5 years. The Committee considered this a slower decline than what would be expected in an untreated cohort. The Committee considered the effect size less precise with confidence intervals that were wide, but considered there was an indication that people may walk more and could improve their cardiovascular fitness, which may improve their ability to compete daily activities such as getting the bus to school.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the MARS registry study results for effect of elosulfase alfa on respiratory function as the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changing 0.2L from baseline (95% CI: 0.1, 0.2) and the mean forced vial capacity (FVC) changing 0.3L from baseline (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3) across a mean treatment duration 5.7 years <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">(Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-72)</a>. The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa appeared to improve both obstructive and restrictive respiratory function.

(Drug Des Devel Ther. 2022;1:143-54</a>), which included expert commentary on the use of elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA. The Committee noted reported associations between low enzyme activity and disease being severe, and between starting treatment a young age (preferably under the age of two years) and individuals with MPS IVA growing taller than would be expected in untreated individuals. The Committee considered this may be early evidence supporting starting treatment with elosulfase alfa early may lead to individuals with MPS growing taller. The Committee considered that benefits associated with growing taller include improved thoracic growth and ability to exercise (due to improved respiratory function) and participation in the community. The Committee noted that more mild phenotypes are often diagnosed later. Members reiterated that the ideal time to treat is as soon as possible after diagnosis. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered the following further studies or study final reports, not considered previously by the Committee, also related to the treatment of MPS IVA with elosulfase alpha:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; color: windowtext;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><strong>MOR-002 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096719218300684?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Hendriksz et al.

The Subcommittee considered that at the time there was significant uncertainty regarding whether elosulfase alfa would provide substantial long-term benefit in all patients with MPS IVA, due to the heterogeneity of the disease and variable age at treatment onset.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health need</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MPS IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome, is a rare, severe, and debilitating inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which is an enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). The Committee noted that with insufficient GALNS, GAGs and other secondary storage compounds progressively accumulate in multiple body organs and tissues.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is a wide spectrum of disease severity associated with MPS IVA. The Committee noted that the severe clinical manifestations of MPS IVA may lead to premature death (with a mean age of death reported to be 25.3 +/- 17.4 years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270860/\" target=\"_blank\">Lavery et al, JIMD Rep. 2015;15:59-66</a>). The Committee considered that these early deaths commonly occur from cardio-respiratory complications (obstructive and restrictive lung disease) and central nervous system complications relating to cervical spinal cord compression. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently 5 diagnosed cases of MPS IVA in New Zealand. The Committee considered it was possible, but unlikely, that there were more <span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">prevalent </span>cases, as<span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> </span>individuals with MPS IVA are unlikely to remain undiagnosed due to the severity of their symptoms. The Committee considered that MPS IVA does not disproportionately affect any specific ethnic group. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the severe morbidity associated with MPS IVA relates to profound skeletal dysplasia, which commonly results in short stature (most are less than 1 metre tall), abnormalities of the spine, chest and limbs, and cardio-respiratory compromise. The Committee noted that the skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities as well as impaired respiratory function contribute to patients\u2019 restricted mobility.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that current management of patients with MPS IVA is focused on addressing the symptoms of the disease, often including orthopaedic operations and analgesic medication for musculoskeletal symptoms and complications. Vaccination and aggressive treatments against respiratory infections are recommended, and respiratory surgeries including tonsillectomy are frequently required. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309407/\" target=\"_blank\">Hendriksz et al.

The Committee considered that the severe health needs of individuals with MPS IVA are likely to have a high emotional and psychological impact on their families and there a likely associated considerable strain on caregivers. The Committee noted one study that explored quality of life for carers of people with MPS that concluded caregivers may face strains (such as attending medical appointments with individuals with MPS IVA, and assisting with daily tasks such as toileting, dressing, or travelling to school or work) which affect their health and well-being (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2326409815613804\" target=\"_blank\">Guarany et al.

The Committee considered that ensuring that these individuals receive adequate education and have the opportunity to take part in meaningful work and other daily activities can be difficult due to MPS IVA-associated barriers. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding application for elosulfase alfa met Pharmac\u2019s principles for rare disorders <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\">(Pharmac-applied definition of a rare disorder).</a></p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that MPS IVA does not disproportionately affect any population groups affected by health inequities in New Zealand. The Committee noted that MPS is not identified as one of the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/te-tiriti-o-waitangi/hauora-arotahi-maori-health-areas-of-focus/\" target=\"_blank\">M\u0101ori health areas of focus for Pharmac</a>.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology. The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs, KS and C6S. The Committee noted that cell uptake of elosulfase alfa into lysosomes is through cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated internalisation leading to restored GALNS activity and clearance of KS.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Vimizim is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome in children and adults of all ages. The Committee noted that the recommended dosage of elosulfase alfa is 2 mg/kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion once a week, and that the total volume of the infusion should be delivered over no less than 4 hours.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that treatment should start as early as possible after diagnosis, ideally before the appearance of non-reversible clinical manifestations of the disease. The Committee noted that MPS IVA is a chronic condition, and considered that treatment with elosulfase alfa would continue for an indefinite length of time.\u00a0</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA has been used internationally for several years. The Committee noted data from the multicentre, multinational, observational Morquio A Registry Study (MARS)which provides 6-year treatment data for elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-</a>72). The Committee noted the MARS data included 323 patients across 65 clinical sites in 17 countries. The Committee noted the mean age at treatment initiation was 14 years, and that the mean length of treatment exposure was 5.5 years. </p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the MARS study reported that the mean change from baseline for the six-minute walk test (6MWT) was -6.1 metres (95% CI: \u221227.6, 15.5) over 5.5 years. The Committee considered this a slower decline than what would be expected in an untreated cohort. The Committee considered the effect size less precise with confidence intervals that were wide, but considered there was an indication that people may walk more and could improve their cardiovascular fitness, which may improve their ability to compete daily activities such as getting the bus to school.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the MARS registry study results for effect of elosulfase alfa on respiratory function as the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changing 0.2L from baseline (95% CI: 0.1, 0.2) and the mean forced vial capacity (FVC) changing 0.3L from baseline (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3) across a mean treatment duration 5.7 years <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">(Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-72)</a>. The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa appeared to improve both obstructive and restrictive respiratory function. The Committee considered that there may represent an effect on the soft tissues of the ribs and on the airways and lung tissue. </p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted a review by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35046639/\" target=\"_blank\">Lee et al. (Drug Des Devel Ther. 2022;1:143-54</a>), which included expert commentary on the use of elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA. The Committee noted reported associations between low enzyme activity and disease being severe, and between starting treatment a young age (preferably under the age of two years) and individuals with MPS IVA growing taller than would be expected in untreated individuals. The Committee considered this may be early evidence supporting starting treatment with elosulfase alfa early may lead to individuals with MPS growing taller. The Committee considered that benefits associated with growing taller include improved thoracic growth and ability to exercise (due to improved respiratory function) and participation in the community. The Committee noted that more mild phenotypes are often diagnosed later. Members reiterated that the ideal time to treat is as soon as possible after diagnosis. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered the following further studies or study final reports, not considered previously by the Committee, also related to the treatment of MPS IVA with elosulfase alpha:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; color: windowtext;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><strong>MOR-002 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096719218300684?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Hendriksz et al.

The Subcommittee considered that at the time there was significant uncertainty regarding whether elosulfase alfa would provide substantial long-term benefit in all patients with MPS IVA, due to the heterogeneity of the disease and variable age at treatment onset.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health need</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MPS IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome, is a rare, severe, and debilitating inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which is an enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). The Committee noted that with insufficient GALNS, GAGs and other secondary storage compounds progressively accumulate in multiple body organs and tissues.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is a wide spectrum of disease severity associated with MPS IVA. The Committee noted that the severe clinical manifestations of MPS IVA may lead to premature death (with a mean age of death reported to be 25.3 +/- 17.4 years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270860/\" target=\"_blank\">Lavery et al, JIMD Rep. 2015;15:59-66</a>). The Committee considered that these early deaths commonly occur from cardio-respiratory complications (obstructive and restrictive lung disease) and central nervous system complications relating to cervical spinal cord compression. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently 5 diagnosed cases of MPS IVA in New Zealand. The Committee considered it was possible, but unlikely, that there were more <span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">prevalent </span>cases, as<span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> </span>individuals with MPS IVA are unlikely to remain undiagnosed due to the severity of their symptoms. The Committee considered that MPS IVA does not disproportionately affect any specific ethnic group. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the severe morbidity associated with MPS IVA relates to profound skeletal dysplasia, which commonly results in short stature (most are less than 1 metre tall), abnormalities of the spine, chest and limbs, and cardio-respiratory compromise. The Committee noted that the skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities as well as impaired respiratory function contribute to patients\u2019 restricted mobility.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that current management of patients with MPS IVA is focused on addressing the symptoms of the disease, often including orthopaedic operations and analgesic medication for musculoskeletal symptoms and complications. Vaccination and aggressive treatments against respiratory infections are recommended, and respiratory surgeries including tonsillectomy are frequently required.

The Committee considered that the severe health needs of individuals with MPS IVA are likely to have a high emotional and psychological impact on their families and there a likely associated considerable strain on caregivers. The Committee noted one study that explored quality of life for carers of people with MPS that concluded caregivers may face strains (such as attending medical appointments with individuals with MPS IVA, and assisting with daily tasks such as toileting, dressing, or travelling to school or work) which affect their health and well-being (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2326409815613804\" target=\"_blank\">Guarany et al.

The Committee considered that ensuring that these individuals receive adequate education and have the opportunity to take part in meaningful work and other daily activities can be difficult due to MPS IVA-associated barriers. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding application for elosulfase alfa met Pharmac\u2019s principles for rare disorders <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/medicines-for-rare-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\">(Pharmac-applied definition of a rare disorder).</a></p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that MPS IVA does not disproportionately affect any population groups affected by health inequities in New Zealand.

The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs, KS and C6S. The Committee noted that cell uptake of elosulfase alfa into lysosomes is through cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated internalisation leading to restored GALNS activity and clearance of KS.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Vimizim is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome in children and adults of all ages. The Committee noted that the recommended dosage of elosulfase alfa is 2 mg/kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion once a week, and that the total volume of the infusion should be delivered over no less than 4 hours.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that treatment should start as early as possible after diagnosis, ideally before the appearance of non-reversible clinical manifestations of the disease. The Committee noted that MPS IVA is a chronic condition, and considered that treatment with elosulfase alfa would continue for an indefinite length of time.\u00a0</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA has been used internationally for several years. The Committee noted data from the multicentre, multinational, observational Morquio A Registry Study (MARS)which provides 6-year treatment data for elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-</a>72). The Committee noted the MARS data included 323 patients across 65 clinical sites in 17 countries. The Committee noted the mean age at treatment initiation was 14 years, and that the mean length of treatment exposure was 5.5 years. </p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the MARS study reported that the mean change from baseline for the six-minute walk test (6MWT) was -6.1 metres (95% CI: \u221227.6, 15.5) over 5.5 years. The Committee considered this a slower decline than what would be expected in an untreated cohort. The Committee considered the effect size less precise with confidence intervals that were wide, but considered there was an indication that people may walk more and could improve their cardiovascular fitness, which may improve their ability to compete daily activities such as getting the bus to school.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the MARS registry study results for effect of elosulfase alfa on respiratory function as the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changing 0.2L from baseline (95% CI: 0.1, 0.2) and the mean forced vial capacity (FVC) changing 0.3L from baseline (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3) across a mean treatment duration 5.7 years <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087504/\" target=\"_blank\">(Mitchell et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2022;137(1-2):164-72)</a>. The Committee noted that elosulfase alfa appeared to improve both obstructive and restrictive respiratory function. The Committee considered that there may represent an effect on the soft tissues of the ribs and on the airways and lung tissue. </p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted a review by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35046639/\" target=\"_blank\">Lee et al. (Drug Des Devel Ther. 2022;1:143-54</a>), which included expert commentary on the use of elosulfase alfa for MPS IVA. The Committee noted reported associations between low enzyme activity and disease being severe, and between starting treatment a young age (preferably under the age of two years) and individuals with MPS IVA growing taller than would be expected in untreated individuals. The Committee considered this may be early evidence supporting starting treatment with elosulfase alfa early may lead to individuals with MPS growing taller. The Committee considered that benefits associated with growing taller include improved thoracic growth and ability to exercise (due to improved respiratory function) and participation in the community. The Committee noted that more mild phenotypes are often diagnosed later. Members reiterated that the ideal time to treat is as soon as possible after diagnosis. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered the following further studies or study final reports, not considered previously by the Committee, also related to the treatment of MPS IVA with elosulfase alpha:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; color: windowtext;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><strong>MOR-002 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096719218300684?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Hendriksz et al.
