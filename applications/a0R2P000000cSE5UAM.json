The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori patients with cystic fibrosis to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori cystic fibrosis patient population. However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori. Treatment of cystic fibrosis falls under the Government health priority of child wellbeing, as well being a chronic respiratory disease, which is one of the Government Health Priority conditions. Respiratory health is M\u0101ori health area of focus identified in Te Whaioranga.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">711.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee reviewed the application for ELX/TEZ/IVA for the treatment for CF at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-08-26-Respiratory-Subcommittee-record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2021</a> meeting, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al.

The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support.

The Committee considered the strength and quality of evidence to be good overall but noted the lack of longer-term evidence and the variation between trial designs, specifically with regard to eligibility criteria and treatment run-in periods. The Committee considered that ppFEV1 is an important clinical outcome for these patients but that it does not comprehensively inform on a patient\u2019s overall lung function, and that 4-week studies are too short in duration to accurately measure any change.

The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion.

The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I.

The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al.

The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget.

However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori.

The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2020;8:65-124</a>). The Committee considered that variations in genotype by ethnicity in New Zealand are unknown at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori and Pacific patients with CF to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori CF patient population. The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support.

The Committee considered the strength and quality of evidence to be good overall but noted the lack of longer-term evidence and the variation between trial designs, specifically with regard to eligibility criteria and treatment run-in periods. The Committee considered that ppFEV1 is an important clinical outcome for these patients but that it does not comprehensively inform on a patient\u2019s overall lung function, and that 4-week studies are too short in duration to accurately measure any change. The Committee noted that there were few patients who discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to adverse events, and that reported adherence rates were high for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the only currently available CFTR modulator in New Zealand is ivacaftor, which is available for less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population as it targets a specific subset of mutations. The Committee noted that the comparator treatment to ELX/TEZ/IVA for the majority of the New Zealand CF patient population is best supportive care. The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion.

The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I.

The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al.

However, the Committee also considered that the available data is very limited, and that there is not enough information available to extrapolate the magnitude of long-term benefit.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there may need to be an effective way of managing access for these patients and that a permissive Special Authority criterion may not effectively target treatment to those patients for whom a benefit would be expected. The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget. The Committee considered that this was an important factor in the context of the lack of long term follow up data that exists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for </span>ELX/TEZ/IVA <span style=\"color: black;\">if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of CF in patients over the age of 12 with at least one F508del mutation.

The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori patients with cystic fibrosis to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori cystic fibrosis patient population. However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori. Treatment of cystic fibrosis falls under the Government health priority of child wellbeing, as well being a chronic respiratory disease, which is one of the Government Health Priority conditions. Respiratory health is M\u0101ori health area of focus identified in Te Whaioranga.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">711.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee reviewed the application for ELX/TEZ/IVA for the treatment for CF at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-08-26-Respiratory-Subcommittee-record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2021</a> meeting, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2020;8:65-124</a>). The Committee considered that variations in genotype by ethnicity in New Zealand are unknown at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori and Pacific patients with CF to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori CF patient population. The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support. The Committee noted that there seems to be a shift in CF therapeutics development from highly specific targets to more generalised off-target CFTR effects.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator which binds to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, as well as potentiating the functioning of CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following published trials relating to the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF in patients with at least one F508del mutation:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.21.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 102 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282384/\" target=\"_blank\">Middleton et al.

The sweat chloride concentration had a mean change from baseline of -22.3 mmol/L in the ELZ/TEZ/IVA treated group (95% CI -24.5 to -20.2) compared with 0.7 mmol/L in the active control group (95% CI -1.4 to 2.8; between-group difference -23.1 mmol/L; 95% CI -26.1 to -20.1; p&lt;0.001). The ELX/TEZ/IVA treated group achieved a mean difference of 10.3 in CFQ-R respiratory domain score (95% CI 8.0 to 12.7) compared with 1.6 in the active control group (95% CI -0.8 to 4.1; between-group difference 8.7; 95% CI 5.3 to 12.1). Subgroup analyses of patients with F/G and F/RF genotypes were consistent with the results of the primary overall group analysis.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.21.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 106 (<a href=\"https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.202102-0509OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">Zemanick et al.

Patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks. F/F patients had a mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 12.2 (95% CI 7.2 to 15.2; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change in sweat chloride of -70.4 mmol/L (95% CI -75.6 to -63.3; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI 3.9 to 10.1), and a mean absolute change from baseline in lung clearance index (LCI2.5) of -1.64 (95% CI -2.34 to -0.94). Patients with F/MF mutations had mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 9.1 (95% CI 7.2 to 15.2; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change in sweat chloride of -55.1 mmol/L (95% CI -59.0 to -51.2; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 6.9 points (95% CI 3.2 to 10.6; p=0.0005), and a mean absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 of 1.72 (95% CI -2.11, -1.33; p&lt;0.0001). Overall, in Study 106 the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for all patients was 10.2 (95% CI 7.9 to 12.6; p&lt;0.0001), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI -63.7, -58.2; p&lt;0.0001), the mean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score was 7.0 points (95% CI 4.7 to 9.2; p&lt;0.0001), and the mean absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 was -1.71 (95% CI -2.11 to -1.33; p&lt;0.0001).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following studies relating to the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.22.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 105 (unpublished, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03525574?term=NCT03525574&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT03525574</a>): 96-week results from patients enrolled in studies 102 and 103, where all patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.22.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 116 (unpublished, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04353817?term=NCT04353817&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04353817</a>): a phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study that included 121 stable CF patients aged 6 to 11 years who were heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a MF mutation (F/MF patients) treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA or placebo over 24 weeks.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.22.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 107 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04183790?term=NCT04183790&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04183790</a>): a roll-over study from Study 106 investigating the long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged between 6 and 11 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no long-term published data available past 24-weeks in patients over the age of 12, and that there is no published data for the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in those under the age of 6 years. The Committee considered the strength and quality of evidence to be good overall but noted the lack of longer-term evidence and the variation between trial designs, specifically with regard to eligibility criteria and treatment run-in periods. The Committee considered that ppFEV1 is an important clinical outcome for these patients but that it does not comprehensively inform on a patient\u2019s overall lung function, and that 4-week studies are too short in duration to accurately measure any change. The Committee noted that there were few patients who discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to adverse events, and that reported adherence rates were high for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the only currently available CFTR modulator in New Zealand is ivacaftor, which is available for less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population as it targets a specific subset of mutations. The Committee noted that the comparator treatment to ELX/TEZ/IVA for the majority of the New Zealand CF patient population is best supportive care. The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion. The Committee noted that funding of ELX/TEZ/IVA would expand the patient population eligible for CFTR modulator treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the risks and benefits of treating those aged 6-11 years or 12 years and over would be similar in that treatment would be expected to alter the baseline progression of disease for all age groups. The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I.

The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al. Modulator Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis: Effectiveness and Value; Evidence Report. Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, April 27, 2020</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that overall, ELX/TEZ/IVA has strong biological plausibility for efficacy and very promising short-term data. However, the Committee also considered that the available data is very limited, and that there is not enough information available to extrapolate the magnitude of long-term benefit.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there may need to be an effective way of managing access for these patients and that a permissive Special Authority criterion may not effectively target treatment to those patients for whom a benefit would be expected. The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget. The Committee considered that this was an important factor in the context of the lack of long term follow up data that exists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for </span>ELX/TEZ/IVA <span style=\"color: black;\">if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of CF in patients over the age of 12 with at least one F508del mutation.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in real-world observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations regarding lung function decline and that differentiation in trajectory of disease would be somewhat dependent on baseline lung function. The Committee considered that this highlighted the benefit of treating the disease early, however re-iterated that the evidence supporting long term outcomes in patients between six and 11 years of age was particularly uncertain.</span></p>",
