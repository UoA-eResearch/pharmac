The Subcommittee considered that as this is a substitution medicine, with no additional benefits or side effects, that most prescribing physicians will not be especially concerned. The Subcommittee considered it would be preferable to have a clinician or independent educational group provide the education to those clinicians who are interested. \u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittee noted all measures of efficacy and adverse events appear indistinguishable. The Subcommittee considered there is no reason to believe, given the physiochemical and functional comparability, that there be any clinical risk with changing to biosimilar rituximab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted market share data for rituximab in selected EU markets and that uptake of rituximab biosimilars, including Riximyo (branded as Rixathon in Europe) has been substantial. The Subcommittee noted confidential data provided by Sandoz on the global usage and estimated cumulative patient exposure to the Riximyo brand since June 2017. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the comparability of Riximyo and Mabthera has been sufficiently demonstrated with regard to physicochemical characteristics, pharmacology, efficacy and safety outcomes. The clinical evidence for comparability is of good quality and supports the use of Riximyo for all funded indications.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered there is no evidence to suggest any differences in the health benefits or risks obtainable with the Riximyo and Mabthera brands of rituximab and concluded it would be clinically acceptable were Riximyo the only available rituximab product (sole supply) for all indications, provided cost savings were worthwhile and supply secured.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that concerns about a change from Mabthera to a biosimilar might arise in patients and/or physicians where the patient has shown a beneficial response to the Mabthera brand. The Subcommittee considered that while there may be a nocebo effect, reassurance will be provided by the virtually identical characteristics of these drugs and the above convincing studies by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637670\" target=\"_blank\">Smolen et al.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712941\" target=\"_blank\">Jurzcak et al.</a> and the fact that the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other medicines regulators have comprehensively assessed the evidence and accepted this biosimilar product. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the supplier is proposing a comprehensive engagement programme, which involves scientific and educational presentations at tertiary and secondary hospitals in the 3 months pre-launch and 4 months post-launch. The Subcommittee considered that as this is a substitution medicine, with no additional benefits or side effects, that most prescribing physicians will not be especially concerned. The Subcommittee considered it would be preferable to have a clinician or independent educational group provide the education to those clinicians who are interested. \u00a0</p>",
