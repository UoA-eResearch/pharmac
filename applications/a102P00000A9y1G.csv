The Committee noted that IV paracetamol is available and funded for use in acute pain, and that although IV ibuprofen is listed as “any brand” on the Hospital Medicines List (HML), there is no Medsafe approved IV ibuprofen product available in New Zealand. The Committee noted that other funded IV NSAIDs include diclofenac sodium and parecoxib. The Committee noted that while IV opioids are efficacious in the treatment of acute pain, they may cause complications due to adverse events including gastrointestinal effects, dizziness, over-sedation, respiratory depression, and opioid induced hyperalgesia.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted<b> </b>that there may be a health need for those caring for family or whānau in acute pain, due to the mental and emotional impact of caregiver burden.

It was noted that ibuprofen possesses analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, and is thought to act through peripheral inhibition of cyclooxygenases and subsequent prostaglandin synthesise inhibition. The Committee noted that <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/ProductDetail.asp?ID=19770"" target=""_blank"">Maxigesic IV is Medsafe approved</a> for the treatment of acute pain, and that the recommended dose is one vial (paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 300 mg in 100 mL) via IV infusion over 15 minutes every 6 hours as necessary until switching to oral therapy, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg paracetamol. The Committee considered that Maxigesic IV would predominantly be used in patients experiencing acute pain as a result of trauma and in the peri-/post-operative setting.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the key evidence for Maxigesic IV for the treatment of acute pain comes from two clinical trials:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.8.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the NCT02689063 trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial trial that compared the efficacy of fixed dose combination (FDC) ibuprofen 300 mg and acetaminophen 1000 mg, ibuprofen 300 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg, and placebo in 276 patients following distal, ﬁrst metatarsal bunionectomy using pain intensity levels ≥40 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The Committee noted that the\xa0sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) from baseline over 48 hours (SPID<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">48</span>)\xa0was significantly higher for the FDC (23.4 mm) than for ibuprofen (9.5 mm), acetaminophen (10.4 mm), and placebo (−1.3 mm; all,\xa0<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The superior\xa0analgesic effect\xa0of the FDC was supported by a range of secondary end points, including reduced opioid usage rates (75% for FDC, 92% for ibuprofen, 93% for acetaminophen, and 96% for placebo; all,\xa0<i>P</i>&lt;0.005). The safety profile of the FDC was comparable to that of intravenous ibuprofen or acetaminophen alone (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291819303510?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"">Daniels et al.

The Committee noted that patients in Group 2 had lower VAS scores (<i>P</i>&lt;0.002) by day 3, with significantly reduced opioid requirements and adverse events compared to Group 1. The Committee noted that the results for the time to discharge from the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and quality of recovery scores were not statistically significant between the two groups (<a href=""https://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MjkwNA%3D%3D&amp;journal=98"" target=""_blank"">Gupta et al.

The Committee considered that the improved analgesia was minimal, and that Maxigesic IV would not provide a significant health benefit over currently funded treatments for acute pain.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that study results also showed that Maxigesic IV reduced but did not eliminate the need for opioid treatment and considered the potential cost saving from this reduced opioid use to be minimal. The Committee noted that the clinician application stated that reduced use of opiates in the acute pain setting may reduce risk of long-term opioid dependence or misuse. The Committee considered that opioid dependence is related to chronic pain, and that while chronic pain can be influenced by failed therapy in the acute setting, there is no identified evidence to suggest that funding of Maxigesic IV (in addition to currently funded treatments) will impact chronic opiate use.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the perception of pain is subjective, dependent on individual differences. Therefore, the comparison of pain scores between individuals in the provided evidence may not provide the best measure of efficacy. Members considered that VAS scores are not designed to be compared between groups, but rather to compare an individual’s response to pain over time. Members also considered that the results of the NCT02689063 trial are difficult to translate to the wider New Zealand population of patients experiencing acute pain, given the study population was limited to bunionectomy patients.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the dose of 300 mg ibuprofen per Maxigesic IV vial is less than the standard ibuprofen dose of 400 mg, or up to 800 mg in other clinical trials. It was considered that there is no evidence to show that ibuprofen 300 mg is clinically equivalent to 400 mg, and that the ibuprofen dose in Maxigesic IV may be subtherapeutic. The Committee considered that the addition of ibuprofen to a paracetamol regime may also introduce the risk for NSAID-related adverse events, noting that ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor. Members considered that use of Maxigesic IV may increase the incidence of GI-related adverse events, particularly given that ulceration complications are prevalent in the first week of NSAID use.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that, based on clinician and supplier advice, parecoxib was used as the comparator for the preliminary economic analysis. The Committee noted that Pharmac staff expressed uncertainty as to whether the most appropriate comparator would be IV parecoxib, IV paracetamol only, or a combination of the two. The Committee considered that parecoxib is a COX-2 specific inhibitor; therefore, it is not directly comparable to ibuprofen (a non-selective COX inhibitor). The Committee considered combination treatment of IV parecoxib and IV paracetamol to be a more appropriate comparator, and that IV diclofenac may be an additional alternative comparator. The Committee also considered the proposed estimate of 2.5 doses of Maxigesic IV per patient to be an underestimate, and that treatment would likely be continued for at least 24 hours.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Committee considered the cost savings from reduced opioid use to be an overestimate, as patients treated with Maxigesic IV are likely to require opioid rescue treatment.

The Committee considered that parecoxib is a COX-2 specific inhibitor; therefore, it is not directly comparable to ibuprofen (a non-selective COX inhibitor). The Committee considered combination treatment of IV parecoxib and IV paracetamol to be a more appropriate comparator, and that IV diclofenac may be an additional alternative comparator. The Committee also considered the proposed estimate of 2.5 doses of Maxigesic IV per patient to be an underestimate, and that treatment would likely be continued for at least 24 hours.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Committee considered the cost savings from reduced opioid use to be an overestimate, as patients treated with Maxigesic IV are likely to require opioid rescue treatment.

This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
