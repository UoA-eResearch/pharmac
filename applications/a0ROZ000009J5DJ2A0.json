The average age of patients receiving cataract surgeries is 73 years and the surgery may involve the administration of intracameral or topical/ subconjunctival antibiotics. The Subcommittee also estimated that 50% of these surgeries are publicly funded, the threshold for which is failing a New Zealand driver licence test. The most likely need for cataract surgery occurs in those who have diabetes, are overweight, or have hypertension. The Subcommittee considered that people with diabetes undergo cataract surgery at a younger age, and generally have poorer outcomes. The Subcommittee noted that this data is not complete and that it primarily comes from clinician surveys from the private sector.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that intracameral therapy involves depositing therapies into the anterior chamber of the eye, whereas subconjunctival therapy leaves a \u2018blister\u2019 of therapeutic agent injected in the conjunctival space. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral therapy for antibiotic treatment following cataract surgery is usually more effective, as the concentration of antibiotic can be up to three times greater compared to subconjunctival techniques. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis, involving bacterial or fungal infection, is a well-recognised complication of cataract surgery. \u00a0This results in severe inflammation of the anterior and/or posterior chambers of the eye and is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, with the most severe outcomes a result of streptococcal infection (approximately 9% of cases) <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis?search=endophthalmitis%20prophylaxis&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=3~108&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=3#H11\" target=\"_blank\">(Durand et al. Up to Date. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee noted that symptoms of post-cataract endophthalmitis usually present within a few days following surgery and can include pain, swelling, decreased visual activity, redness (of eyelids and/or conjunctiva) and haziness of the cornea. It can have a significant long-term and often irreversible effect on a patient\u2019s vision and quality of life. The severity of visual loss is associated with the pathogen (pseudomonal infections having the worst outcomes), presenting visual acuity and the promptness of appropriate treatment. The Subcommittee noted that the risk of developing post-cataract endophthalmitis is significantly greater when the cataract surgeries are complex, such as in the case of posterior capsule tears. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis is rare, with a worldwide incidence of between 0.1 and 4 per 1,000 surgeries. The Subcommittee noted that incidence data for New Zealand is incomplete with literature reporting anywhere from 3 to 120 cases a year, and numbers vary based on type of surgery, geographical location, surgeon experience. The Subcommittee considered that, though rare, post-cataract endophthalmitis can result in significant healthcare costs borne by both patients and the public health system. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an Auckland study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284342-demographics-and-ocular-biometric-characteristics-of-patients-undergoing-cataract-surgery-in-auckland-new-zealand/?from_term=cataract+new+zealand&amp;from_filter=ds1.y_5&amp;from_page=2&amp;from_pos=2\" target=\"_blank\">Yoon et al. Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2016;44:106-13</a>) which indicated that 4.7% of cataract surgery patients were M\u0101ori, which is lower than the M\u0101ori proportion of the national and DHB population. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori who do get cataract surgery present with symptoms up to a decade earlier than non-M\u0101ori, which leads to longer quality of life impacts in the case of surgery complications. The Subcommittee noted that data on the rates of cataract surgery in the Pacific population are incomplete.\u00a0However, it was noted that because the incidence of diabetes in the Pacific population is potentially up to 3-fold greater than in the non-Pacific population, which would likely result in earlier presentation and potentially worse outcomes for Pacific peoples. The Subcommittee noted that, overall, post-cataract endophthalmitis rates have been falling over time, as surgical interventions and therapies have become more targeted and effective, and the standard of care has become more focused on single- compared with multi-use items. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current practice in New Zealand for the prevention of infections following cataract surgery involves the application of\u00a0povidone antiseptic twice prior to surgery, then the administration of either a subconjunctival antibiotic injection (cefuroxime, cefazolin or gentamicin) or an intracameral antibiotic injection (cefuroxime or cefazolin), followed by the application of post-operative topical antibiotic therapy (chloramphenicol or neomycin/polymyxin) for one week. The Subcommittee considered that the use of povidone pre-operatively currently has the biggest impact on reducing rates of post-cataract surgery infections. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral antibiotics are already commonly used, and if funded, it is thought likely that most, if not all, ophthalmologists would switch to this route of antibiotic prophylaxis. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the main driver for intracameral antibiotic administration is to reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis. Other drivers considered for this route of administration include reduced stinging and discomfort for patients, compared with topical administration; the option of giving a topical (and thus less dense) anaesthetic; removal of the need for patients to wear an eye-patch following surgery; and allows bilateral same-day surgery to be undertaken (which is more convenient for patients who need surgery on both eyes and who may be travelling from out of town, and reduces the carbon footprint associated with multiple surgeries). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a 2007 prospective trial identifying the risk factors and effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531690/\" target=\"_blank\">Endophthalmitis Study Group. J Cataract Refract Surg. 2007;33:978-88</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the study reported an almost five-fold increase in the risk of developing endophthalmitis for patients who did not receive intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis (4.92-fold increase; 95% CI 1.87-12.9). The Subcommittee noted that although the study is widely accepted as justification for intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis, it has received criticism for having high endophthalmitis incidence in the control arm and included a variety of surgical techniques which confounded the results. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the results from various other pivotal studies vary significantly. Post-operative infection rates, when using intracameral antibiotics post cataract surgery, of anywhere between 0 and 22-fold reductions have been reported, and there are no head-to-head trials, either comparing intracameral antibiotic treatment with no post-operative antibiotics or comparing subconjunctival injection to intracameral administration. The Subcommittee considered that a 3-5-fold reduction in infection rate was a reasonable estimate. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral antibiotic administration post cataract surgery is the standard of care across Europe and the UK. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that although intracameral antibiotics are safe and effective, they come at a greater cost compared to current treatments, and there are currently no funded \u2018ready to go\u2019 options which do not require reconstitution or serial dilutions. The Subcommittee noted that compounding of pharmaceuticals such as intracameral antibiotics occurs in surgical theatre in private ophthalmological practice, rather than in a hospital pharmacy, which the Subcommittee considered increases the risk of contamination, human error, and toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that if cefuroxime or moxifloxacin were to be funded, vials would not be used for more than one patient, due to the higher risks of contamination associated with vial sharing.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cefuroxime (1.0 mg per 0.1 mL powder for injection, reconstituted with saline) is a second-generation cephalosporin and is the most studied regarding post-cataract endophthalmitis. The Subcommittee noted people with penicillin allergy may also react to cephalosporins. The Subcommittee also noted that cefuroxime is less effective than moxifloxacin in the treatment of gram-positive bacteria and discussed the problem of enterococci resistance. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral cefuroxime has a relatively short duration of action (4-5 hours), that adverse events are rare and usually involve accidental overdose leading to toxicity, and is traditionally harder to compound than moxifloxacin.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin (0.15 mg per 0.1 mL or 0.6 mg in 0.4 mL solution, prepared by mixing with saline for a dose of 600 ug in 0.4 mL) is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone which is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin is less well studied in endophthalmitis, but that studies have shown a 2-fold reduction in the rate of endophthalmitis following posterior capsule rupture when moxifloxacin is used as part of the treatment regimen for cataract surgery. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin has a biphasic action with a long duration, contains no preservative, and is possibly less toxic intracamerally than cefuroxime. The Subcommittee also noted that there is a possibility of coagulase negative staphylococci resistance with moxifloxacin but considered that this risk was low. The Subcommittee noted that due to the larger injection volume used for moxifloxacin compared to cefuroxime, there is a higher chance of the therapeutic dose of the antibiotic reaching the desired part of the eye. The Subcommittee also noted that moxifloxacin during surgery can be used to re-form and reconstitute the eye.

The average age of patients receiving cataract surgeries is 73 years and the surgery may involve the administration of intracameral or topical/ subconjunctival antibiotics. The Subcommittee also estimated that 50% of these surgeries are publicly funded, the threshold for which is failing a New Zealand driver licence test. The most likely need for cataract surgery occurs in those who have diabetes, are overweight, or have hypertension. The Subcommittee considered that people with diabetes undergo cataract surgery at a younger age, and generally have poorer outcomes. The Subcommittee noted that this data is not complete and that it primarily comes from clinician surveys from the private sector.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that intracameral therapy involves depositing therapies into the anterior chamber of the eye, whereas subconjunctival therapy leaves a \u2018blister\u2019 of therapeutic agent injected in the conjunctival space. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral therapy for antibiotic treatment following cataract surgery is usually more effective, as the concentration of antibiotic can be up to three times greater compared to subconjunctival techniques. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis, involving bacterial or fungal infection, is a well-recognised complication of cataract surgery. \u00a0This results in severe inflammation of the anterior and/or posterior chambers of the eye and is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, with the most severe outcomes a result of streptococcal infection (approximately 9% of cases) <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis?search=endophthalmitis%20prophylaxis&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=3~108&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=3#H11\" target=\"_blank\">(Durand et al. Up to Date. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee noted that symptoms of post-cataract endophthalmitis usually present within a few days following surgery and can include pain, swelling, decreased visual activity, redness (of eyelids and/or conjunctiva) and haziness of the cornea. It can have a significant long-term and often irreversible effect on a patient\u2019s vision and quality of life. The severity of visual loss is associated with the pathogen (pseudomonal infections having the worst outcomes), presenting visual acuity and the promptness of appropriate treatment. The Subcommittee noted that the risk of developing post-cataract endophthalmitis is significantly greater when the cataract surgeries are complex, such as in the case of posterior capsule tears. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis is rare, with a worldwide incidence of between 0.1 and 4 per 1,000 surgeries. The Subcommittee noted that incidence data for New Zealand is incomplete with literature reporting anywhere from 3 to 120 cases a year, and numbers vary based on type of surgery, geographical location, surgeon experience. The Subcommittee considered that, though rare, post-cataract endophthalmitis can result in significant healthcare costs borne by both patients and the public health system. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an Auckland study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284342-demographics-and-ocular-biometric-characteristics-of-patients-undergoing-cataract-surgery-in-auckland-new-zealand/?from_term=cataract+new+zealand&amp;from_filter=ds1.y_5&amp;from_page=2&amp;from_pos=2\" target=\"_blank\">Yoon et al. Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2016;44:106-13</a>) which indicated that 4.7% of cataract surgery patients were M\u0101ori, which is lower than the M\u0101ori proportion of the national and DHB population. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori who do get cataract surgery present with symptoms up to a decade earlier than non-M\u0101ori, which leads to longer quality of life impacts in the case of surgery complications. The Subcommittee noted that data on the rates of cataract surgery in the Pacific population are incomplete.\u00a0However, it was noted that because the incidence of diabetes in the Pacific population is potentially up to 3-fold greater than in the non-Pacific population, which would likely result in earlier presentation and potentially worse outcomes for Pacific peoples. The Subcommittee noted that, overall, post-cataract endophthalmitis rates have been falling over time, as surgical interventions and therapies have become more targeted and effective, and the standard of care has become more focused on single- compared with multi-use items. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current practice in New Zealand for the prevention of infections following cataract surgery involves the application of\u00a0povidone antiseptic twice prior to surgery, then the administration of either a subconjunctival antibiotic injection (cefuroxime, cefazolin or gentamicin) or an intracameral antibiotic injection (cefuroxime or cefazolin), followed by the application of post-operative topical antibiotic therapy (chloramphenicol or neomycin/polymyxin) for one week. The Subcommittee considered that the use of povidone pre-operatively currently has the biggest impact on reducing rates of post-cataract surgery infections. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral antibiotics are already commonly used, and if funded, it is thought likely that most, if not all, ophthalmologists would switch to this route of antibiotic prophylaxis. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the main driver for intracameral antibiotic administration is to reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis. Other drivers considered for this route of administration include reduced stinging and discomfort for patients, compared with topical administration; the option of giving a topical (and thus less dense) anaesthetic; removal of the need for patients to wear an eye-patch following surgery; and allows bilateral same-day surgery to be undertaken (which is more convenient for patients who need surgery on both eyes and who may be travelling from out of town, and reduces the carbon footprint associated with multiple surgeries). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a 2007 prospective trial identifying the risk factors and effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531690/\" target=\"_blank\">Endophthalmitis Study Group. J Cataract Refract Surg. 2007;33:978-88</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the study reported an almost five-fold increase in the risk of developing endophthalmitis for patients who did not receive intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis (4.92-fold increase; 95% CI 1.87-12.9). The Subcommittee noted that although the study is widely accepted as justification for intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis, it has received criticism for having high endophthalmitis incidence in the control arm and included a variety of surgical techniques which confounded the results. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the results from various other pivotal studies vary significantly. Post-operative infection rates, when using intracameral antibiotics post cataract surgery, of anywhere between 0 and 22-fold reductions have been reported, and there are no head-to-head trials, either comparing intracameral antibiotic treatment with no post-operative antibiotics or comparing subconjunctival injection to intracameral administration. The Subcommittee considered that a 3-5-fold reduction in infection rate was a reasonable estimate. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral antibiotic administration post cataract surgery is the standard of care across Europe and the UK. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that although intracameral antibiotics are safe and effective, they come at a greater cost compared to current treatments, and there are currently no funded \u2018ready to go\u2019 options which do not require reconstitution or serial dilutions. The Subcommittee noted that compounding of pharmaceuticals such as intracameral antibiotics occurs in surgical theatre in private ophthalmological practice, rather than in a hospital pharmacy, which the Subcommittee considered increases the risk of contamination, human error, and toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that if cefuroxime or moxifloxacin were to be funded, vials would not be used for more than one patient, due to the higher risks of contamination associated with vial sharing.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cefuroxime (1.0 mg per 0.1 mL powder for injection, reconstituted with saline) is a second-generation cephalosporin and is the most studied regarding post-cataract endophthalmitis. The Subcommittee noted people with penicillin allergy may also react to cephalosporins. The Subcommittee also noted that cefuroxime is less effective than moxifloxacin in the treatment of gram-positive bacteria and discussed the problem of enterococci resistance. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral cefuroxime has a relatively short duration of action (4-5 hours), that adverse events are rare and usually involve accidental overdose leading to toxicity, and is traditionally harder to compound than moxifloxacin.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin (0.15 mg per 0.1 mL or 0.6 mg in 0.4 mL solution, prepared by mixing with saline for a dose of 600 ug in 0.4 mL) is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone which is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin is less well studied in endophthalmitis, but that studies have shown a 2-fold reduction in the rate of endophthalmitis following posterior capsule rupture when moxifloxacin is used as part of the treatment regimen for cataract surgery. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin has a biphasic action with a long duration, contains no preservative, and is possibly less toxic intracamerally than cefuroxime. The Subcommittee also noted that there is a possibility of coagulase negative staphylococci resistance with moxifloxacin but considered that this risk was low. The Subcommittee noted that due to the larger injection volume used for moxifloxacin compared to cefuroxime, there is a higher chance of the therapeutic dose of the antibiotic reaching the desired part of the eye. The Subcommittee also noted that moxifloxacin during surgery can be used to re-form and reconstitute the eye. The Subcommittee considered that moxifloxacin is straightforward to compound and would provide a significant suitability benefit over currently funded options, and a small suitability benefit over cefuroxime. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are only two head-to-head trials of cefuroxime and moxifloxacin.

The average age of patients receiving cataract surgeries is 73 years and the surgery may involve the administration of intracameral or topical/ subconjunctival antibiotics. The Subcommittee also estimated that 50% of these surgeries are publicly funded, the threshold for which is failing a New Zealand driver licence test. The most likely need for cataract surgery occurs in those who have diabetes, are overweight, or have hypertension. The Subcommittee considered that people with diabetes undergo cataract surgery at a younger age, and generally have poorer outcomes. The Subcommittee noted that this data is not complete and that it primarily comes from clinician surveys from the private sector.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that intracameral therapy involves depositing therapies into the anterior chamber of the eye, whereas subconjunctival therapy leaves a \u2018blister\u2019 of therapeutic agent injected in the conjunctival space. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral therapy for antibiotic treatment following cataract surgery is usually more effective, as the concentration of antibiotic can be up to three times greater compared to subconjunctival techniques. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis, involving bacterial or fungal infection, is a well-recognised complication of cataract surgery. \u00a0This results in severe inflammation of the anterior and/or posterior chambers of the eye and is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, with the most severe outcomes a result of streptococcal infection (approximately 9% of cases) <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis?search=endophthalmitis%20prophylaxis&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=3~108&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=3#H11\" target=\"_blank\">(Durand et al. Up to Date. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee noted that symptoms of post-cataract endophthalmitis usually present within a few days following surgery and can include pain, swelling, decreased visual activity, redness (of eyelids and/or conjunctiva) and haziness of the cornea. It can have a significant long-term and often irreversible effect on a patient\u2019s vision and quality of life. The severity of visual loss is associated with the pathogen (pseudomonal infections having the worst outcomes), presenting visual acuity and the promptness of appropriate treatment. The Subcommittee noted that the risk of developing post-cataract endophthalmitis is significantly greater when the cataract surgeries are complex, such as in the case of posterior capsule tears. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-cataract endophthalmitis is rare, with a worldwide incidence of between 0.1 and 4 per 1,000 surgeries. The Subcommittee noted that incidence data for New Zealand is incomplete with literature reporting anywhere from 3 to 120 cases a year, and numbers vary based on type of surgery, geographical location, surgeon experience. The Subcommittee considered that, though rare, post-cataract endophthalmitis can result in significant healthcare costs borne by both patients and the public health system. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an Auckland study (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284342-demographics-and-ocular-biometric-characteristics-of-patients-undergoing-cataract-surgery-in-auckland-new-zealand/?from_term=cataract+new+zealand&amp;from_filter=ds1.y_5&amp;from_page=2&amp;from_pos=2\" target=\"_blank\">Yoon et al. Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2016;44:106-13</a>) which indicated that 4.7% of cataract surgery patients were M\u0101ori, which is lower than the M\u0101ori proportion of the national and DHB population. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori who do get cataract surgery present with symptoms up to a decade earlier than non-M\u0101ori, which leads to longer quality of life impacts in the case of surgery complications. The Subcommittee noted that data on the rates of cataract surgery in the Pacific population are incomplete.\u00a0However, it was noted that because the incidence of diabetes in the Pacific population is potentially up to 3-fold greater than in the non-Pacific population, which would likely result in earlier presentation and potentially worse outcomes for Pacific peoples. The Subcommittee noted that, overall, post-cataract endophthalmitis rates have been falling over time, as surgical interventions and therapies have become more targeted and effective, and the standard of care has become more focused on single- compared with multi-use items. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current practice in New Zealand for the prevention of infections following cataract surgery involves the application of\u00a0povidone antiseptic twice prior to surgery, then the administration of either a subconjunctival antibiotic injection (cefuroxime, cefazolin or gentamicin) or an intracameral antibiotic injection (cefuroxime or cefazolin), followed by the application of post-operative topical antibiotic therapy (chloramphenicol or neomycin/polymyxin) for one week. The Subcommittee considered that the use of povidone pre-operatively currently has the biggest impact on reducing rates of post-cataract surgery infections. The Subcommittee considered that intracameral antibiotics are already commonly used, and if funded, it is thought likely that most, if not all, ophthalmologists would switch to this route of antibiotic prophylaxis. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the main driver for intracameral antibiotic administration is to reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis. Other drivers considered for this route of administration include reduced stinging and discomfort for patients, compared with topical administration; the option of giving a topical (and thus less dense) anaesthetic; removal of the need for patients to wear an eye-patch following surgery; and allows bilateral same-day surgery to be undertaken (which is more convenient for patients who need surgery on both eyes and who may be travelling from out of town, and reduces the carbon footprint associated with multiple surgeries). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a 2007 prospective trial identifying the risk factors and effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531690/\" target=\"_blank\">Endophthalmitis Study Group. J Cataract Refract Surg. 2007;33:978-88</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the study reported an almost five-fold increase in the risk of developing endophthalmitis for patients who did not receive intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis (4.92-fold increase; 95% CI 1.87-12.9). The Subcommittee noted that although the study is widely accepted as justification for intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis, it has received criticism for having high endophthalmitis incidence in the control arm and included a variety of surgical techniques which confounded the results. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the results from various other pivotal studies vary significantly. Post-operative infection rates, when using intracameral antibiotics post cataract surgery, of anywhere between 0 and 22-fold reductions have been reported, and there are no head-to-head trials, either comparing intracameral antibiotic treatment with no post-operative antibiotics or comparing subconjunctival injection to intracameral administration. The Subcommittee considered that a 3-5-fold reduction in infection rate was a reasonable estimate. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral antibiotic administration post cataract surgery is the standard of care across Europe and the UK. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that although intracameral antibiotics are safe and effective, they come at a greater cost compared to current treatments, and there are currently no funded \u2018ready to go\u2019 options which do not require reconstitution or serial dilutions. The Subcommittee noted that compounding of pharmaceuticals such as intracameral antibiotics occurs in surgical theatre in private ophthalmological practice, rather than in a hospital pharmacy, which the Subcommittee considered increases the risk of contamination, human error, and toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that if cefuroxime or moxifloxacin were to be funded, vials would not be used for more than one patient, due to the higher risks of contamination associated with vial sharing.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cefuroxime (1.0 mg per 0.1 mL powder for injection, reconstituted with saline) is a second-generation cephalosporin and is the most studied regarding post-cataract endophthalmitis. The Subcommittee noted people with penicillin allergy may also react to cephalosporins. The Subcommittee also noted that cefuroxime is less effective than moxifloxacin in the treatment of gram-positive bacteria and discussed the problem of enterococci resistance. The Subcommittee noted that intracameral cefuroxime has a relatively short duration of action (4-5 hours), that adverse events are rare and usually involve accidental overdose leading to toxicity, and is traditionally harder to compound than moxifloxacin.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin (0.15 mg per 0.1 mL or 0.6 mg in 0.4 mL solution, prepared by mixing with saline for a dose of 600 ug in 0.4 mL) is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone which is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin is less well studied in endophthalmitis, but that studies have shown a 2-fold reduction in the rate of endophthalmitis following posterior capsule rupture when moxifloxacin is used as part of the treatment regimen for cataract surgery. The Subcommittee noted that moxifloxacin has a biphasic action with a long duration, contains no preservative, and is possibly less toxic intracamerally than cefuroxime. The Subcommittee also noted that there is a possibility of coagulase negative staphylococci resistance with moxifloxacin but considered that this risk was low. The Subcommittee noted that due to the larger injection volume used for moxifloxacin compared to cefuroxime, there is a higher chance of the therapeutic dose of the antibiotic reaching the desired part of the eye. The Subcommittee also noted that moxifloxacin during surgery can be used to re-form and reconstitute the eye. The Subcommittee considered that moxifloxacin is straightforward to compound and would provide a significant suitability benefit over currently funded options, and a small suitability benefit over cefuroxime. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are only two head-to-head trials of cefuroxime and moxifloxacin.

This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.
