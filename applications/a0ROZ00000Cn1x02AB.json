The Committee noted that there is currently one specialist who provides care for all individuals impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD in New Zealand and that there are no reported cases of M\u0101ori individuals who are impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD. The Committee noted that there are M\u0101ori impacted by IRDs in New Zealand, however a significant proportion of these individuals are living with PDE6b-mediated IRDs, which voretigene neparvovec would not be used to treat. The Committee noted that this does not exclude the possibility that M\u0101ori may be impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD, and the absence of current cases may be due to the condition\u2019s rarity.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Background</em></strong></h2><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the supplier\u2019s application for voretigene neparvovec is the first gene therapy to be considered by the Committee. The Committee noted that Pharmac has not previously received a funding application for an inherited retinal dystrophy.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that inherited retinal dystrophies are a group of genetically and phenotypical heterogenous diseases that result in the progressive loss of photoreceptor function and eventual irreversible blindness. The Committee noted that <em>RPE65 </em>is involved in the regulation of light responsive pigment in the retina and abnormal <em>RPE65 </em>leads to malfunctioning rod photoreceptors and eventual permanent damage of the retinal epithelial cells. This results in night blindness, deterioration of visual acuity and progressive eventual blindness.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD diagnosis is made when two abnormal copies of the gene (these can be different variants) are present. The Committee noted that there have been over 60 different mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> genes reported, and that the heterogenicity of the mutations and the subsequent impact on RPE65\u2019s functional properties accounts for the range of phenotypes presented by the individuals. The Committee noted that abnormalities in the <em>RPE65 </em>gene is implicated in two main clinical conditions: Leber congenital amaurosis, and retinitis pigmentosa.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Health need</em></strong></h2><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is an unmet health need for individuals with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD due to there being no treatments currently available in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the health need is high as individuals generally present with symptoms before the age of five and their vision will continue to decline as they age. The Committee noted that individuals diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa typically become legally blind by the age of 20 and 40, respectively.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that losing visual acuity at an early age has wide-ranging implications for an individual\u2019s social position, education, mental health, and general health (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27466983/\" target=\"_blank\">Cumberland &amp; Rahi. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2016; 134:959-66</a>). The Committee noted that the overall health need is difficult to quantify, and the impact of vision loss experienced by the individual can be variable. The Committee noted that the evidence regarding the health need associated with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD was\u00a0limited due to the rarity of the disease</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that retinitis pigmentosa affects an estimated 1 in 4000 people and 3% of these individuals\u2019 sight is affected by mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> gene. The Committee noted that Leber congential amaurosis affects an estimated 1 in 80,000 people and 10% of these individuals\u2019 sight is affected by mutations in the <em>RPE65 </em>gene (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35098484/\" target=\"_blank\">Sallum et al.

Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet. 2020; 184:708-717</a>). The Committee considered the applicant\u2019s estimated number of 13 people affected to be speculative, but not unrealistic, as only child-onset IRD have been reported in New Zealand and that some individuals may not be able to access the appropriate health care options to be considered for genetic diagnosis.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples have been diagnosed with <em>PDE6b</em>-mediated IRDs. The Committee noted that no individuals living with IRDs and genetically tested for the <em>RPE65</em> mutation are reported to be of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity. The Committee noted that it was unknown if M\u0101ori or Pacific peoples were disproportionally impacted by <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD due to lack of evidence and the rarity of the disease.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health needs and emotional distress of families and wh\u0101nau of individuals with <em>RPE65-</em>mediated IRDs would be significant.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Health benefit</em></strong></h2><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that voretigene neparvovec is an adeno-associated viral type 2 gene therapy vector with a cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken beta actin promoter driving the expression of the functional human retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (h<em>RPE65</em>) gene. Voretigene neparvovec is designed to deliver a functional copy of human <em>RPE65</em> gene to the cells of the retina (retinal pigment epithelial cell) in individuals who have reduced or absent levels of biologically active RPE65. Cellular response to the provision of the biologically active RPE65 results in corrected cycling of the visual cycle (retinoid cycle)</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the risks documented with voretigene neparvovec as an intervention have been those associated with retinal eye surgery and sub-retinal injection and are outlined in 1.14\u00a0below.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the following evidence relating to the use of voretigene neparvovec in the treatment of <em>RPE65-</em>mediated IRD:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31868-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al.

Nine individuals were in the control group and these individuals received voretigene neparvovec after the conclusion of the study at 1-year. <ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Individuals visual function was assessed before and after therapeutic intervention (if received), with initial base line results compared to 1-year follow-up results to determine change in vision function. Individuals who received voretigene neparvovec demonstrated an average improvement of 1.8 (SD 1.1) in the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test compared to the control group 0.2 (SD 1.0). After 30 days difference in change of score of 1.6 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.41, p= 0.0013) between voretigene neparvovec and control group was noted. The groups maintained the change throughout the first year in the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test. At 1-year, 65% of intervention group passed the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test at the lowest level of luminescence vs 0% in the control group. Individuals who received voretigene neparvovec experienced improvement in light sensitivity from day 30 following treatment and this was maintained through 1-year of monitoring. The intervention group gained 8.1 letters in the Holladay scale of the visual acuity test in comparison to the control groups gain of 1.6 letters. The intervention group gained 9 letters in the Lange scale of the visual acuity test in comparison to the control groups gain of 1.6 letters. The intervention group gained 302 degrees and the control group lost 76.7 degrees in visual field testing. The intervention group gained 7.7 decibels and the control group lost 0.2 decibels in macular threshold testing. A mean change of 7.9 decibels (95% CI 3.50 to 12.2, p=0.0005) No meaningful change was demonstrated in either group in comparison to pre-injection foveal sensitivity measurements.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">No severe adverse effects were reported.

The Committee considered that, based on the available trial evidence, it was reasonable to assume a treatment effect of at least three years, with waning or no treatment benefit thereafter.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a duration of treatment effect of greater than three years was biologically plausible, and Committee noted that retinal cells are a terminally differentiated, non-replicating, cell type which could reasonably be expected to retain episomes of healthy copies <em>RPE65</em> after successful delivery via voretigene neparvovec. The Committee noted evidence that in animal studies of voretigene neparvovec, episomes with healthy copies of the <em>RPE65</em> gene were found in the target cell types as long as 10 years after injection (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36103843/\" target=\"_blank\">Leroy et al.

The Committee noted that <em>RPE65 </em>is involved in the regulation of light responsive pigment in the retina and abnormal <em>RPE65 </em>leads to malfunctioning rod photoreceptors and eventual permanent damage of the retinal epithelial cells. This results in night blindness, deterioration of visual acuity and progressive eventual blindness.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD diagnosis is made when two abnormal copies of the gene (these can be different variants) are present. The Committee noted that there have been over 60 different mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> genes reported, and that the heterogenicity of the mutations and the subsequent impact on RPE65\u2019s functional properties accounts for the range of phenotypes presented by the individuals. The Committee noted that abnormalities in the <em>RPE65 </em>gene is implicated in two main clinical conditions: Leber congenital amaurosis, and retinitis pigmentosa.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Health need</em></strong></h2><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is an unmet health need for individuals with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD due to there being no treatments currently available in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the health need is high as individuals generally present with symptoms before the age of five and their vision will continue to decline as they age.

The Committee noted that there is currently one specialist who provides care for all individuals impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD in New Zealand and that there are no reported cases of M\u0101ori individuals who are impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD. The Committee noted that there are M\u0101ori impacted by IRDs in New Zealand, however a significant proportion of these individuals are living with PDE6b-mediated IRDs, which voretigene neparvovec would not be used to treat. The Committee noted that this does not exclude the possibility that M\u0101ori may be impacted by RPE65-mediated IRD, and the absence of current cases may be due to the condition\u2019s rarity.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Background</em></strong></h2><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the supplier\u2019s application for voretigene neparvovec is the first gene therapy to be considered by the Committee. The Committee noted that Pharmac has not previously received a funding application for an inherited retinal dystrophy.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that inherited retinal dystrophies are a group of genetically and phenotypical heterogenous diseases that result in the progressive loss of photoreceptor function and eventual irreversible blindness. The Committee noted that <em>RPE65 </em>is involved in the regulation of light responsive pigment in the retina and abnormal <em>RPE65 </em>leads to malfunctioning rod photoreceptors and eventual permanent damage of the retinal epithelial cells. This results in night blindness, deterioration of visual acuity and progressive eventual blindness.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD diagnosis is made when two abnormal copies of the gene (these can be different variants) are present. The Committee noted that there have been over 60 different mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> genes reported, and that the heterogenicity of the mutations and the subsequent impact on RPE65\u2019s functional properties accounts for the range of phenotypes presented by the individuals. The Committee noted that abnormalities in the <em>RPE65 </em>gene is implicated in two main clinical conditions: Leber congenital amaurosis, and retinitis pigmentosa.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Health need</em></strong></h2><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is an unmet health need for individuals with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD due to there being no treatments currently available in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the health need is high as individuals generally present with symptoms before the age of five and their vision will continue to decline as they age. The Committee noted that individuals diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa typically become legally blind by the age of 20 and 40, respectively.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that losing visual acuity at an early age has wide-ranging implications for an individual\u2019s social position, education, mental health, and general health (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27466983/\" target=\"_blank\">Cumberland &amp; Rahi. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2016; 134:959-66</a>). The Committee noted that the overall health need is difficult to quantify, and the impact of vision loss experienced by the individual can be variable. The Committee noted that the evidence regarding the health need associated with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD was\u00a0limited due to the rarity of the disease</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that retinitis pigmentosa affects an estimated 1 in 4000 people and 3% of these individuals\u2019 sight is affected by mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> gene. The Committee noted that Leber congential amaurosis affects an estimated 1 in 80,000 people and 10% of these individuals\u2019 sight is affected by mutations in the <em>RPE65 </em>gene (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35098484/\" target=\"_blank\">Sallum et al.

Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet. 2020; 184:708-717</a>). The Committee considered the applicant\u2019s estimated number of 13 people affected to be speculative, but not unrealistic, as only child-onset IRD have been reported in New Zealand and that some individuals may not be able to access the appropriate health care options to be considered for genetic diagnosis.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples have been diagnosed with <em>PDE6b</em>-mediated IRDs. The Committee noted that no individuals living with IRDs and genetically tested for the <em>RPE65</em> mutation are reported to be of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity. The Committee noted that it was unknown if M\u0101ori or Pacific peoples were disproportionally impacted by <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD due to lack of evidence and the rarity of the disease.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health needs and emotional distress of families and wh\u0101nau of individuals with <em>RPE65-</em>mediated IRDs would be significant.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Health benefit</em></strong></h2><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that voretigene neparvovec is an adeno-associated viral type 2 gene therapy vector with a cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken beta actin promoter driving the expression of the functional human retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (h<em>RPE65</em>) gene. Voretigene neparvovec is designed to deliver a functional copy of human <em>RPE65</em> gene to the cells of the retina (retinal pigment epithelial cell) in individuals who have reduced or absent levels of biologically active RPE65. Cellular response to the provision of the biologically active RPE65 results in corrected cycling of the visual cycle (retinoid cycle)</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the risks documented with voretigene neparvovec as an intervention have been those associated with retinal eye surgery and sub-retinal injection and are outlined in 1.14\u00a0below.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the following evidence relating to the use of voretigene neparvovec in the treatment of <em>RPE65-</em>mediated IRD:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31868-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al.

Nine individuals were in the control group and these individuals received voretigene neparvovec after the conclusion of the study at 1-year. <ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Individuals visual function was assessed before and after therapeutic intervention (if received), with initial base line results compared to 1-year follow-up results to determine change in vision function. Individuals who received voretigene neparvovec demonstrated an average improvement of 1.8 (SD 1.1) in the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test compared to the control group 0.2 (SD 1.0). After 30 days difference in change of score of 1.6 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.41, p= 0.0013) between voretigene neparvovec and control group was noted. The groups maintained the change throughout the first year in the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test. At 1-year, 65% of intervention group passed the bilateral multi-luminance mobility test at the lowest level of luminescence vs 0% in the control group. Individuals who received voretigene neparvovec experienced improvement in light sensitivity from day 30 following treatment and this was maintained through 1-year of monitoring. The intervention group gained 8.1 letters in the Holladay scale of the visual acuity test in comparison to the control groups gain of 1.6 letters. The intervention group gained 9 letters in the Lange scale of the visual acuity test in comparison to the control groups gain of 1.6 letters. The intervention group gained 302 degrees and the control group lost 76.7 degrees in visual field testing. The intervention group gained 7.7 decibels and the control group lost 0.2 decibels in macular threshold testing. A mean change of 7.9 decibels (95% CI 3.50 to 12.2, p=0.0005) No meaningful change was demonstrated in either group in comparison to pre-injection foveal sensitivity measurements.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">No severe adverse effects were reported.

Ophthal Retina. 2022; 6:58-64</a></li></ul><p>1.17 The Committee noted that the trials included small numbers of participants but considered that this was not unexpected due to the rarity of the disease. The Committee considered that the evidence was of good quality due to the robust design and multiple measurements done to confer results.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was no obvious endpoint that could be used to define &#39;successful treatment&#39; with voretigene neparvovec given the range of endpoints reported in trials and uncertainty around how changes to these endpoints translate into improvements in health-related quality of life. The Committee considered that greater clarity around the clinical meaningfulness of these endpoints would be needed before a determination regarding successful treatment could be made. The Committee considered that the health benefits reported in the trials are likely to be beneficial for family and wh\u0101nau in addition to the individual receiving treatment.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a key uncertainty in the benefit derived from voretigene neparvovec treatment was the duration of treatment effect, which refers to the period over which an individual accrues some, or all, of the potential benefit from treatment. The Committee considered that, based on the available trial evidence, it was reasonable to assume a treatment effect of at least three years, with waning or no treatment benefit thereafter.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a duration of treatment effect of greater than three years was biologically plausible, and Committee noted that retinal cells are a terminally differentiated, non-replicating, cell type which could reasonably be expected to retain episomes of healthy copies <em>RPE65</em> after successful delivery via voretigene neparvovec. The Committee noted evidence that in animal studies of voretigene neparvovec, episomes with healthy copies of the <em>RPE65</em> gene were found in the target cell types as long as 10 years after injection (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36103843/\" target=\"_blank\">Leroy et al. Opthalmic Res. 2022</a> [preprint]). The Committee considered however that if a substantial proportion of retinal cells were not covered by the injection site, some deterioration of vision could occur even after initially successful treatment.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the standard of evidence required to support assumption of treatment effects beyond three years duration in humans was not yet available. The Committee noted that over the four-year follow-up period of <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31868-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. Lancet. 2017; 390:849-60</a>, there was early evidence of a waning treatment benefit in year 4 after voretigene neparvovec administration (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33798654/\" target=\"_blank\">Maquire et al. Ophthalmology. 2021; 128:1460-1468</a>). The Committee considered that data from subsequent follow-up studies of the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31868-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. Lancet. 2017; 390:849-60</a> cohort, and emerging evidence around treatment effect for gene therapies more generally, would provide greater confidence on the expected duration of treatment benefit associated with voretigene neparvovec.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that voretigene neparvovec prevents further vision loss but does not improve vision. The Committee considered that voretigene neparvovec would therefore benefit those individuals who have a sufficient number of healthy retinal cells and that immediate intervention with voretigene neparvovec following confirmed <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD would be the most appropriate to prevent further vision loss.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that it is unknown whether an individual could receive additional courses of voretigene neparvovec due to the irreversible and progressive loss of vision associated with <em>RPE65</em>-mediated IRD.</p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there would be considerable consequences for the health system if voretigene neparvovec were to be funded. The Committee noted that voretigene neparvovec must be prepared in a pharmaceutical compounding setting that is capable of handling and preparing adeno-associated viral vector-based gene therapy products and considered that such a setting may not currently be available in New Zealand. The Committee considered that significant upskilling and training of involved personnel would be required to implement this service.</p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the supplier reported that a treatment centre would require an ophthalmologist with expertise in the care and treatment of people with IRDs, along with the presence of, or an affiliation with, a retinal surgeon experienced in sub-retinal surgery and capable of administrating voretigene neparvovec. The Committee noted that this therapy is extremely specialised, and that considerable effort would be required to provide the appropriate clinical setting.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Suitability</em></strong></h2><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that voretigene neparvovec is injected into each eye separately, with a minimum of 6-days between each injection and that individuals receiving this therapy would be required to travel twice to the treatment centre to receive this therapy. The Committee noted that there is currently no facility that is immediately able to store, prepare, handle, and administer the therapy The Committee considered that the most likely location for such a facility would be in Auckland where there is an IRD specialist clinic. However, the Committee considered that this may be an additional barrier for people who live rurally, or who must take extended trips to visit the centre where the treatment is available.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Cost and savings. </em></strong></h2><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, based on international epidemiological data, there were potentially as many as 13 people with RPE65-mediated IRDs in New Zealand and that to date, three individuals have been identified through testing. The Committee noted that the supplier estimated that 55% of these individuals would have sufficient viable retinal cells to be eligible for voretigene neparvovec The Committee considered that testing rates for RPE65 mutations and the uptake rate for voretigene neparvovec among eligible individuals could be as high as 100% if voretigene neparvovec was funded, given the lack of funded alternative treatments for IRDs, regardless of the need for travel to receive treatment.</p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that funding voretigene neparvovec could result in incremental costs to the health system due to requirements around testing for eligibility for treatment, and the protocols and infrastructure required to deliver this gene therapy. The Committee considered that there would also likely be training requirements for clinicians involved in the administration of voretigene neparvovec into the subretinal space. The Committee considered, however, that the numbers of treatments delivered would to be small given the small numbers of eligible individuals with RPE65-mediated IRDs.</p><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the challenges associated with appraising the value of gene therapies due to the high pharmaceutical costs, the substantial uncertainty in the duration of treatment effect, the health-related quality of life benefits, and the potential need for re-treatment if the treatment effect waned. The Committee considered that the cost-effectiveness of voretigene neparvovec was likely to be influenced by these factors and was also highly uncertain given the lack of longer-term follow-up data to date.</p><h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Summary for assessment</em></strong></h2><p>1.30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for voretigene neparvovec if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of RPE65-mediated IRD.
