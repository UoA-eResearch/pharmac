The Subcommittee considered that previous estimates of the number of patients with blood eosinophils &gt;500 cells/µL may have been overestimated; and considered that uptake of mepolizumab since its funding may have been affected by patient transfer from compassionate access schemes, the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020, and the availability of prefilled syringes.
