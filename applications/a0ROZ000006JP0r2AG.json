The Committee noted that in New Zealand approximately 89% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 22% of NSCLC patients tested for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation (EGFRm) have EGFRm positive tumours. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in general, M\u0101ori are disproportionally impacted by lung cancer compared with non-M\u0101ori, with younger age of onset, late diagnosis and worse outcomes. The Committee noted that there is a higher tested and reported incidence of EGFRm in South-East Asian patients (40%) and Pacific patients (24%) than in New Zealand European (18%) or M\u0101ori patients (10%) (<a href=\"https://www.moh.govt.nz/NoteBook/nbbooks.nsf/0/993C0B7C224F0DDCCC257F7F0002BC87/$file/final_research_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">McKeage et al.

The Committee considered that people with EGFRm NSCLC generally have a longer baseline survival than other subsets of lung cancer. The Committee noted that there are two currently funded first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target EGFR mutations. Members therefore considered that the unmet need for osimertinib in this first-line setting may be lower than in other lung cancer subgroups for which a targeted treatment is not funded.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that resistance often develops following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and that this is most commonly caused by the T790 mutation. The Committee noted that osimertinib is an orally administered third generation TKI that is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of EGFRs harbouring single (L858R or del746<span style=\"\">\u2010</span>750) or double (L858R/T790M or del746<span style=\"\">\u2010</span>750/T790M) mutations. The Committee noted that osimertinib has similar side effects to other funded TKIs. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the FLAURA phase III, double-blind, randomised control trial, which investigated the use of osimertinib compared with gefitinib or erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC. </p><p>The Committee noted the median progression free survival (PFS) was 18.9 months in the osimertinib group compared with 10.2 months in the comparator group, hazard ratio (HR) for disease progression or death 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.57) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29151359/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Soria et al.

N Engl J Med. 2020;382:41-50</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the trial was of high quality, however that the results for OS were still immature with borderline significance, with the upper confidence interval limit for the HR including 1.00, and noted that the published results attained statistical significance for OS p-values only by extending the HR\u2019s CI beyond 95%, which the Committee considered differed from usual formal statistical reporting convention.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the Japanese subset population of the FLAURA trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30508196-osimertinib-versus-standard-of-care-egfr-tki-as-first-line-treatment-for-egfrm-advanced-nsclc-flaura-japanese-subset/?from_single_result=Osimertinib+versus+standard-of-care+EGFR-TKI+as+first-line+treatment+for+EGFRm+advanced+NSCLC%3A+FLAURA+Japanese+subset\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Ohe et al. Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2019;49:29-36</a>). The Committee noted that median PFS was 19.1 months in the osimertinib group compared with 13.8 months in the gefitinib group, HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.38-0.99). The Committee noted that the median OS was not reached. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the FLAURA trial publications regarding central nervous system (CNS) progression (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153097/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Reungwetwattana et al.

Eur J Cancer. 2020;125:49-57</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that while the evidence of osimertinib in this indication was of high quality and reported improved PFS compared with gefitinib/erlotinib, the uncertainty of overall survival benefit of osimertinib over gefitinib/erlotinib and the lower unmet health need of this patient group compared with other lung cancer subtypes influenced the cost-neutral recommendation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that NICE (England/Wales) did not recommend osimertinib for untreated locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in adults; this lack of a positive recommendation also influenced PTAC\u2019s cost-neutral recommendation over a higher positive recommendation. The Committee also noted the PBAC (Australia), CADTH\u2019s pERC (Canada) and SMC (Scotland) did not recommend osimertinib for this indication. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that currently funded first-line treatments for patients with EGFRm NSCLC include the oral TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib. The Committee considered that these agents were appropriate comparators to osimertinib in this treatment line. The Committee considered that while osimertinib had demonstrated efficacy in this patient population, there was no clear unmet health need for a third TKI in the first-line setting for EGFRm NSCLC. The Committee noted that following disease progression on current first-line treatment, second-line treatment is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that EGFR mutation testing is already occurring for first-line treatment and that this proposal would therefore not result in further mutation testing.</p><p>The Committee noted when making its recommendation that the net price of the two currently funded pharmaceuticals in this line of treatment (erlotinib and gefitinib) may be different and that its cost-neutral recommendation related to cost-neutrality to the more expensive of the two agents. The Committee noted that, were osimertinib to be funded on this basis, that this would likely result in a net increase in expenditure for this line of treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it was unclear whether targeted treatments would be a suitable option in patients who progressed on osimertinib if used in this first-line setting. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from CaTSoP regarding the sequence of treatments in this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are a number of ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of multiple TKIs in combination for the treatment of EGFRm NSCLC. The Committee considered that, pending the results of these trials, there may be requests to PHARMAC for funding of combination TKI treatment over monotherapy in the future.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that in New Zealand approximately 89% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 22% of NSCLC patients tested for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation (EGFRm) have EGFRm positive tumours. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, in general, M\u0101ori are disproportionally impacted by lung cancer compared with non-M\u0101ori, with younger age of onset, late diagnosis and worse outcomes.

The Committee considered that people with EGFRm NSCLC generally have a longer baseline survival than other subsets of lung cancer. The Committee noted that there are two currently funded first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target EGFR mutations. Members therefore considered that the unmet need for osimertinib in this first-line setting may be lower than in other lung cancer subgroups for which a targeted treatment is not funded.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that resistance often develops following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and that this is most commonly caused by the T790 mutation.

The Subcommittee noted that liquid (blood) based testing is currently undertaken internationally and within some New Zealand centres, using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) typically via either private funding or as part of a clinical trial.

Members considered that ctDNA testing is likely to be introduced within the next five years and that there would be further evolution of mutation testing in New Zealand to track changes over time. The Subcommittee reiterated its suggestion for Pharmac to engage with laboratory representatives, noting the range of potential EGFR mutations and resistance mechanisms, with complexity and testing likely to increase over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that people with EGFRm positive NSCLC currently receive first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib, followed by second and third-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 60-80% of patients with EGFRm positive NSCLC respond to first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib (time to progression of between 9.2 to 13.1 months based on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1758834011427927?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Wang et al.

The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitors are not as effective in patients with driver mutations, although the evidence for checkpoint inhibitors and driver mutation targeting agents is evolving.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been investigated for EGFRm positive NSCLC in the phase III FLAURA (first-line osimertinib vs gefitinib or erlotinib) and AURA-3 (second-line osimertinib vs pemetrexed with carboplatin/cisplatin in T790M mutation positive disease) clinical trials.

The Subcommittee considered that uptake would likely be rapid. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of a Canadian publication reporting participation in osimertinib clinical trials which reported that 97.5% of patients who progressed after first-line treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI had a biopsy at disease progression, with patients typically requiring an average of two biopsies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096193/\" target=\"_blank\">Chu et al. Curr Oncol. 2020;27:27-33</a>). The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand, up to five biopsies may be attempted per patient and, based on the Canadian data, almost all of the approximately 150 New Zealand patients receiving an EGFR TKI per year would proceed to a biopsy post-disease progression, of which approximately 109 would have successful biopsies in the first instance. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on extrapolation of the Canadian trial data, approximately 40-60% of New Zealand patients would test positive for T790M mutation after progression on a TKI (approximately 62 of 109 successfully biopsied patients) which is slightly less than what may be estimated from the AURA-3 trial data alone (from <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1612674/suppl_file/nejmoa1612674_appendix.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary appendix S2</a>).

The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac could seek further advice from professional pathology societies in New Zealand such as the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) to understand testing in the New Zealand context independent of inter-centre variability. The Subcommittee considered that the number of patients who would seek access to funded treatments for T790M positive disease would increase if validated ctDNA testing were implemented and performed routinely in New Zealand.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that funding of osimertinib in the second-line would have additional health system impact for 12- to 18-months due to on-treatment monitoring (monthly clinic visits, three-monthly CT scans, and blood tests), and a small number of patients (approximately &lt;5%, or 3-4 patients per year) who would require hospital admission for management of grade 3-4 adverse events.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would appropriately target osimertinib treatment to the population with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who would benefit in the second-line setting, including patients with central nervous system metastasis.

The Subcommittee noted that liquid (blood) based testing is currently undertaken internationally and within some New Zealand centres, using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) typically via either private funding or as part of a clinical trial.

Members considered that ctDNA testing is likely to be introduced within the next five years and that there would be further evolution of mutation testing in New Zealand to track changes over time. The Subcommittee reiterated its suggestion for Pharmac to engage with laboratory representatives, noting the range of potential EGFR mutations and resistance mechanisms, with complexity and testing likely to increase over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that people with EGFRm positive NSCLC currently receive first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib, followed by second and third-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 60-80% of patients with EGFRm positive NSCLC respond to first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib (time to progression of between 9.2 to 13.1 months based on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1758834011427927?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Wang et al.

The Subcommittee considered that, based on current access to EGFR testing, approximately 200 patients per year might be eligible for first-line osimertinib treatment. The Subcommittee considered that, as testing becomes more accessible throughout New Zealand there is likely to be a gradual increase in the eligible patient numbers, with further increases once ctDNA testing becomes routinely available (potentially up to approximately 400 per year).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if osimertinib were funded for first-line treatment of EGFRm positive NSCLC, current patients with stable disease on a first-generation TKI who are not experiencing dose-limiting toxicities would be unlikely to switch to osimertinib.

The Subcommittee noted that overall survival was a secondary outcome in AURA-3 and that the final overall survival analysis had now been published (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0923-7534(20)42155-6\" target=\"_blank\">Papadimitrakopoulou et al.

The Subcommittee noted there was substantial crossover from platinum-pemetrexed to osimertinib (N=99; 73% of platinum-pemetrexed group) and considered that while this limited extrapolation of this data to the New Zealand setting, it suggests that osimertinib may be useful in either the second-line or third-line setting.</p><p>1.20.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that the AURA-3 final analysis used a rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) to report an exploratory crossover-adjusted median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 15.9 months with platinum-pemetrexed (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.60). The Subcommittee noted the wide confidence interval which crossed one, however, members considered that the statistical analysis with this model supports a survival benefit of osimertinib compared with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy and highlights the effect of treatment crossover on the results of the non-adjusted OS analysis. </p><p>1.20.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee considered that the methods within the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) crossover-adjusted analysis were reasonable and appropriate, and that the results were applicable to the New Zealand context as no third-line EGFR TKIs are available following progression on platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.
