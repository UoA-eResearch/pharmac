The Subcommittee noted that the 200/6 strength formulation, available in both brands, is also occasionally used in children aged under 12. The Subcommittee noted that DuoResp Spiromax is not currently approved for AIR therapy with or without maintenance for patients under the age of 18, but that a decision by Medsafe whether to approve for adolescent patients is expected in 2021. The Subcommittee considered that the appropriate age cut-off for this inhaler should be 12 years old, as there is no 100/6 strength of DuoResp Spiromax at this time.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the currently available strengths of budesonide/eformoterol dry powder inhalers are 200/6 and 400/12 for DuoResp Spiromax, and 100/6, 200/6, and 400/12 for Symbicort Turbuhaler. The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation. The Subcommittee considered that if not available, this would reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the 400/12 strength of budesonide/eformoterol as reliever therapy in primary care. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that current practice with salbutamol pMDIs is that they are dispensed in large quantities so that patients can receive multiple inhalers per dispensing. The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner’s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=""color: black; font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/"" target=""_blank"">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the annualised exacerbation rate was lower for the AIR therapy group than that of the salbutamol group (absolute rate, 0.195 vs. 0.400; relative rate 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.72; p&lt;0.001) and that the number of severe exacerbations was reduced in the AIR therapy group compared with the salbutamol only group. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of AIR therapy was that in mild asthma it would reduce the annualised exacerbation rate and the number of severe exacerbations compared to salbutamol-only therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was important to incorporate baseline exacerbation rates into any analysis of the impact of AIR therapy, as a direct comparison between trial arms could over-estimate true rates due to the variation in exacerbation rates between arms at baseline.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if budesonide/eformoterol were to be funded in New Zealand stat for AIR therapy in patients with mild asthma, the most appropriate comparator would be currently funded SABA treatments.

The Subcommittee considered that availability of AIR therapy could be a driver for transitioning patients from their reliance on SABA inhalers to budesonide/eformoterol, which is safer and more effective at reducing exacerbations. The Subcommittee also considered that funding decisions should minimise barriers for patients and clinicians to adhere to the updated treatment guidelines. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that budesonide/eformoterol DPIs and pMDIs could replace the use of SABA and ICS inhalers, but that they could potentially be used incorrectly in combination with SABA and other ICS if patients were confused about inhaler use.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the paradigm shift from using SABA reliever inhalers alone for the treatment of mild asthma to using budesonide/eformoterol inhalers for symptom relief could see a large proportion of current SABA-only patients shift to budesonide/eformoterol products for symptom relief over 5-years. The Subcommittee considered that the PHARMAC estimate of 8% uptake per annum, which was based on the uptake of SMART therapies earlier, was likely too low, as advocacy and health sector support for AIR therapy is strong, and AIR is a simpler regimen than SMART. However, the Subcommittee considered that it is unclear how many patients would transition from SABA-only therapy to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy, given previous experience with salbutamol generic transitions. The Subcommittee noted that some patients are loyal to a certain product and in many cases are willing to pay an extra part charge per dispensing to maintain treatment with their current branded therapy, which could mean that some patients will resist switching from SABA-only to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be cost saving to the health system from reduced exacerbations as a result of AIR vs SABA-only therapy.

The Subcommittee also considered that, during the phase-out of SABA-only use in favour of AIR, costs to the combined pharmaceutical budget will escalate in the interim due to the higher price of AIR treatment options compared with SABA inhalers. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients are likely to require more than two inhalers per dispensing in order to keep inhalers in more than one location in case exacerbations were acute and severe. The Subcommittee considered that a clinician would typically be comfortable with prescribing 6 months’ supply to a patient deemed to be well managed on current therapy, if this meant they would be able to store inhalers at more than one location. The Subcommittee considered however that this would also contribute to greater potential wastage of a product with a shorter shelf-life.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Future procurement process for budesonide/eformoterol</i></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the record of the Respiratory Procurement Advisory Group meeting (<a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PRAG-Record-2019-09.pdf"" target=""_blank"">September 2019</a>). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to retain both 100/6 and 200/6 strengths after any commercial process regarding budesonide/eformoterol inhalers.

The Subcommittee noted that DuoResp Spiromax is not currently approved for AIR therapy with or without maintenance for patients under the age of 18, but that a decision by Medsafe whether to approve for adolescent patients is expected in 2021.

The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation.

The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner’s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=""color: black; font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/"" target=""_blank"">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the 200/6 strength formulation, available in both brands, is also occasionally used in children aged under 12. The Subcommittee noted that DuoResp Spiromax is not currently approved for AIR therapy with or without maintenance for patients under the age of 18, but that a decision by Medsafe whether to approve for adolescent patients is expected in 2021. The Subcommittee considered that the appropriate age cut-off for this inhaler should be 12 years old, as there is no 100/6 strength of DuoResp Spiromax at this time.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the currently available strengths of budesonide/eformoterol dry powder inhalers are 200/6 and 400/12 for DuoResp Spiromax, and 100/6, 200/6, and 400/12 for Symbicort Turbuhaler. The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation. The Subcommittee considered that if not available, this would reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the 400/12 strength of budesonide/eformoterol as reliever therapy in primary care. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that current practice with salbutamol pMDIs is that they are dispensed in large quantities so that patients can receive multiple inhalers per dispensing. The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner’s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=""color: black; font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/"" target=""_blank"">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the annualised exacerbation rate was lower for the AIR therapy group than that of the salbutamol group (absolute rate, 0.195 vs. 0.400; relative rate 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.72; p&lt;0.001) and that the number of severe exacerbations was reduced in the AIR therapy group compared with the salbutamol only group. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of AIR therapy was that in mild asthma it would reduce the annualised exacerbation rate and the number of severe exacerbations compared to salbutamol-only therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was important to incorporate baseline exacerbation rates into any analysis of the impact of AIR therapy, as a direct comparison between trial arms could over-estimate true rates due to the variation in exacerbation rates between arms at baseline.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if budesonide/eformoterol were to be funded in New Zealand stat for AIR therapy in patients with mild asthma, the most appropriate comparator would be currently funded SABA treatments.

The Subcommittee considered that availability of AIR therapy could be a driver for transitioning patients from their reliance on SABA inhalers to budesonide/eformoterol, which is safer and more effective at reducing exacerbations.

The Subcommittee considered that the PHARMAC estimate of 8% uptake per annum, which was based on the uptake of SMART therapies earlier, was likely too low, as advocacy and health sector support for AIR therapy is strong, and AIR is a simpler regimen than SMART. However, the Subcommittee considered that it is unclear how many patients would transition from SABA-only therapy to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy, given previous experience with salbutamol generic transitions. The Subcommittee noted that some patients are loyal to a certain product and in many cases are willing to pay an extra part charge per dispensing to maintain treatment with their current branded therapy, which could mean that some patients will resist switching from SABA-only to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be cost saving to the health system from reduced exacerbations as a result of AIR vs SABA-only therapy.

The Subcommittee considered that a clinician would typically be comfortable with prescribing 6 months’ supply to a patient deemed to be well managed on current therapy, if this meant they would be able to store inhalers at more than one location.

<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
