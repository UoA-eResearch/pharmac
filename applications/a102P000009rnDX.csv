The Subcommittee considered the evidence was compelling and consistent in the context of this disease with low patient numbers meaning that only phase I or II or retrospective cohort studies were viable, without randomised data available. The Subcommittee considered that it is very unlikely that there will be further phase III randomised trials for either of these agents against a chemotherapy comparator, as ROS1 targeted therapies have been approved in other jurisdictions for some time. The Subcommittee noted that crizotinib has been approved by both the PBAC and Scottish Medicines Consortium in July 2018, and in Canada in May 2019, and that entrectinib was approved by the PBAC in March 2020, NICE (UK and Wales) August 2020, Scotland December 2020, and Canada in January 2021. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend single agent crizotinib or entrectinib in the first line or second line in patients with stage IV NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement, and considered this would be the likely treatment paradigm should these agents be funded in New Zealand <a href=""https://www.esmo.org/content/download/347819/6934778/1/ESMO-CPG-mNSCLC-15SEPT2020.pdf"" target=""_blank"">(ESMO 2020.

However, they considered that while the applicant has proposed there is a potential difference between crizotinib and entrectinib due to different effects on brain metastases relating to CNS penetration. The Subcommittee considered that a therapeutic agent that can cross the blood-brain barrier is an attractive option in NSCLC, but that there was currently insufficient evidence that entrectinib is more effective than crizotinib in this setting. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered both crizotinib and entrectinib have suitability advantages over current chemotherapy treatment and may provide health system advantages due to reduced infusion requirements when compared to chemotherapy.\xa0The Subcommittee considered the impact of these advantages was difficult to predict, as numbers are very small, and as there may be some patients who progress to chemotherapy following TKI treatment who may have been considered unsuitable for this in the first line.

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
