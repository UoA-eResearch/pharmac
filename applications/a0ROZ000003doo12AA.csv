However, the Subcommittee considered that the funded supplements contained levels of copper and selenium that were significantly below the levels required for repletion and improved wound healing in severe cases.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two publications (Toppi et al. Burns. 2019;45:1456-61 and McInnes et al. Burns. 2019;45:1553-61) from the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand (BRANZ), which indicated that there are approximately 18 major burns patients admitted to hospital per year in New Zealand, almost all of which would transferred to the National Burns Centre at Middlemore Hospital for treatment. The Committee noted that most patients admitted to hospital with severe burns were aged between 18 and 40 years of age, and the majority were male.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the very high health need of patients with major burns, noting a mortality rate of 17% and a median length of stay in intensive care of approximately one week. The Committee noted that the median length of stay in hospital based on ACC data (Toppi et al. 2019) was 24 days.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients admitted acutely to hospital in New Zealand with a burn between 1996 and 2006 (Mistry et al. Burns. 2010;36:403-8), which reported higher rates of hospital admission for Māori, Pacific and socioeconomically deprived populations. The Committee noted that these populations were more likely to be exposed to burn hazards such as poor housing quality, lack of smoke detectors, and cigarette smoking.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the treatment of patients with major burns required significant hospital resource, noting that approximately 60% of the total cost of hospitalisation was related to inpatient care, followed by operations (20%) and outpatient visits (Koljonen et el. J Burn Care Res. 2013;34:318–25).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is strong biological plausibility for supplementation to be initiated as soon as possible following hospital admission when acute trace element depletion is likely to occur due to significant exudative losses and metabolic and oxidative stress. The Committee noted that supplementation should be continued until the wound has healed and/or any mineral deficiencies are restored. The Committee noted that copper needs to be delivered intravenously due to the competition between copper and zinc for intestinal absorption via the metallothionein transporter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two international guidelines that outline the nutritional requirements for patients admitted to hospital with major burns:</p><p><br></p><p>The Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) (McCalve et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016;40:159-211), which considered the evidence for all antioxidants and for all critically ill patients in the United States</p><p><br></p><p>The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) endorsed recommendations for nutritional therapy in major burns (Rousseau et al. Clin Nutr. 2013;32:497-502). The Committee noted that the ESPEN-endorsed recommendations outline that initiating supplementation immediately after admission is associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation, improved antioxidant defences, improved immunity with lower incidence of infectious complications, improved wound healing, and possibly shorter ICU stays.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the guidelines noted above are a combination of syntheses of published empirical evidence and expert opinion. While the Committee considered there to be a consensus view that trace element supplementation be included as a part of a broader nutritional strategy for major burn patients, it considered the evidence-base underpinning the guidelines to be limited and of low quality.</p><p><br></p><p>The Members noted that two small prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trials previously reviewed by PTAC in March 2014 (Berger et al. Am J Clin Nutr.2007;85:1293- 1300 &amp; 1301-6) were referenced extensively throughout the ESPEN-endorsed recommendations. The Committee noted that these trials examined the effect of supplementation with copper, selenium and zinc on various parameters of burn healing in patients with burns greater than 20% of body surface area. The Committee noted that trace element supplementation was associated with early normalisation of plasma trace element concentrations, lower grafting requirements, and fewer pulmonary infections, but considered that the trials lacked primary endpoints, power calculations and clarity around the number of participants included in these studies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted three further publications, which it had not previously reviewed:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Pantet et al. Clin Nutr. 2019;38:246-51: a retrospective dose-finding study assessing the safety and efficacy of a trace element repletion strategy in 139 patients with burns greater than 20% of body surface area. The Committee considered there to be no significant safety issues in this study associated with doses in line with those outlined by the National Burns Centre (400mg Copper chloride and 300μg Selenium) and noted that the mean number of infections per patient during the first 21 days significantly reduced as higher elemental doses were prescribed, from 2.3 infections per patient to 1.7 infections per patients (p &lt; 0.05).</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Berger et al. Crit Care. 2006;10:153: an aggregation of two consecutive, randomised, double-blinded supplementation studies assessing the impact of trace element supplementation on infection risk, wound healing and length of ICU stay in 41 severe burn patients admitted to hospital. The Committee noted that the publication reported no statistically significant reduction in the median length of mechanical ventilation in the supplemented group, however, found a small reduction in the number of total infections (from 2.0 ± 1.0 in the supplement group vs 3.5 ± 1.2 placebo group (p &lt;0.001)) and median length of ICU stays as proportion of burned body surface area (0.63 (0.23 to 1.64) supplemented group vs 0.99 (0.43 to 2.48) placebo group (p = 0.002)). The Committee considered that while the combined studies reported a meaningful reduction in wound healing, there was insufficient evidence to suggest this translated into shorter hospital stays.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Kurmis et al. J Burn Care Res. 2016;37:143-59: a systematic review and meta-analysis on trace element supplementation following severe burn injury, which included eight studies. The Committee noted that the analysis reported a significant decrease in infectious episodes with trace element supplementation (weighted mean difference: −1.25, 95% CI −1.70 to −0.80, p &lt;0.00001,) but that there was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.18 t0 5.01, p =0.96) or time in intensive care. Of note these findings relied on the Berger studies above and two earlier studies from the same group.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, while much of the external validity of the evidence-base is limited by the fact that it is underpinned by a few trials conducted on a small cohort of Swiss patients (the Berger et al. 2006 and 2007 publications), it considered there to be no reason that it would not be relevant to the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that empirical evidence supporting trace element supplementation in the setting of major burns to be of moderate strength but low quality, despite there being a strong mechanistic rationale for their use. The Committee considered that while there was some improvement in endpoints such as the rate of wound healing and the number of infections, there was limited information on the effect on long-term quality of life. Members considered that it was very difficult to establish an evidence-base in this field, particularly regarding longer term health outcomes, noting that BRANZ was set up for this purpose but has experienced low participation rates, high-loss to follow-up and strong responder bias (Gabbe et al. Burn. 2015;41:1732-40).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it appropriate to limit use to specialist burns units or after consultation with the national specialist burns unit so as to reduce the risk of use outside of the intended patient population. The Committee considered that the existing eligibility criteria for multivitamin and mineral supplements be amended for consistency. The Committee considered that requiring evidence of nutritional deficiency could be introduced if hospital usage is significantly higher than expected.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered the financial risk of funding copper and selenium for this indication to be relatively small, given that trace element supplementation is already used in this setting. Members noted that there is currently limited visibility of hospital usage due to variable reporting and considered that funding via the Pharmaceutical Schedule would improve visibility and that this could be used to tighten restrictions if required. The Committee considered that burns specialists could inform the resource use associated with treating this patient population, and how hospital day and regrafting requirements could be affected by the funding of trace mineral supplementation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was unclear how many patients may access treatment if trace element supplementation was funded. The Committee considered that Toppi et al. 2019 reported fewer than 20 patients a year, but that this was only adults with severe burns, while Mistry et al. 2010 reflected all patients admitted with burns and was likely an overestimate. The Committee recommended that Pharmac staff engage with burns experts to get a better estimate of current usage.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for trace element supplementation is zinc/selenium/copper in combination, and that this would reflect current practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for copper and selenium if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment for major burns.

The Committee noted that the National Burns Centre currently accesses copper and selenium through the DHB hospital rapid NPPA assessment process&#39; emergency use rule, and considered that any decision to list copper chloride and selenium in the Pharmaceutical Schedule would likely have only a small impact on the overall use of these products.\xa0</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(62, 62, 60);"">\ufeff</span>The Committee noted that copper and selenium are critical trace elements in several cellular pathways in growth and metabolism, including those involved in wound healing, and are disproportionately lost in patients with major burns. The Committee noted that there is a strong biological rationale for the role of trace element supplementation in improving skin graft success and in reducing the risk of infection following severe burns.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that multivitamin and mineral supplements are already listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for patients hospitalised with burns. However, the Subcommittee considered that the funded supplements contained levels of copper and selenium that were significantly below the levels required for repletion and improved wound healing in severe cases.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two publications (Toppi et al. Burns. 2019;45:1456-61 and McInnes et al. Burns. 2019;45:1553-61) from the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand (BRANZ), which indicated that there are approximately 18 major burns patients admitted to hospital per year in New Zealand, almost all of which would transferred to the National Burns Centre at Middlemore Hospital for treatment. The Committee noted that most patients admitted to hospital with severe burns were aged between 18 and 40 years of age, and the majority were male.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the very high health need of patients with major burns, noting a mortality rate of 17% and a median length of stay in intensive care of approximately one week. The Committee noted that the median length of stay in hospital based on ACC data (Toppi et al. 2019) was 24 days.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients admitted acutely to hospital in New Zealand with a burn between 1996 and 2006 (Mistry et al. Burns. 2010;36:403-8), which reported higher rates of hospital admission for Māori, Pacific and socioeconomically deprived populations. The Committee noted that these populations were more likely to be exposed to burn hazards such as poor housing quality, lack of smoke detectors, and cigarette smoking.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the treatment of patients with major burns required significant hospital resource, noting that approximately 60% of the total cost of hospitalisation was related to inpatient care, followed by operations (20%) and outpatient visits (Koljonen et el. J Burn Care Res. 2013;34:318–25).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is strong biological plausibility for supplementation to be initiated as soon as possible following hospital admission when acute trace element depletion is likely to occur due to significant exudative losses and metabolic and oxidative stress. The Committee noted that supplementation should be continued until the wound has healed and/or any mineral deficiencies are restored. The Committee noted that copper needs to be delivered intravenously due to the competition between copper and zinc for intestinal absorption via the metallothionein transporter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two international guidelines that outline the nutritional requirements for patients admitted to hospital with major burns:</p><p><br></p><p>The Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) (McCalve et al. JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2016;40:159-211), which considered the evidence for all antioxidants and for all critically ill patients in the United States</p><p><br></p><p>The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) endorsed recommendations for nutritional therapy in major burns (Rousseau et al. Clin Nutr. 2013;32:497-502). The Committee noted that the ESPEN-endorsed recommendations outline that initiating supplementation immediately after admission is associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation, improved antioxidant defences, improved immunity with lower incidence of infectious complications, improved wound healing, and possibly shorter ICU stays.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the guidelines noted above are a combination of syntheses of published empirical evidence and expert opinion. While the Committee considered there to be a consensus view that trace element supplementation be included as a part of a broader nutritional strategy for major burn patients, it considered the evidence-base underpinning the guidelines to be limited and of low quality.</p><p><br></p><p>The Members noted that two small prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trials previously reviewed by PTAC in March 2014 (Berger et al. Am J Clin Nutr.2007;85:1293- 1300 &amp; 1301-6) were referenced extensively throughout the ESPEN-endorsed recommendations. The Committee noted that these trials examined the effect of supplementation with copper, selenium and zinc on various parameters of burn healing in patients with burns greater than 20% of body surface area. The Committee noted that trace element supplementation was associated with early normalisation of plasma trace element concentrations, lower grafting requirements, and fewer pulmonary infections, but considered that the trials lacked primary endpoints, power calculations and clarity around the number of participants included in these studies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted three further publications, which it had not previously reviewed:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Pantet et al. Clin Nutr. 2019;38:246-51: a retrospective dose-finding study assessing the safety and efficacy of a trace element repletion strategy in 139 patients with burns greater than 20% of body surface area. The Committee considered there to be no significant safety issues in this study associated with doses in line with those outlined by the National Burns Centre (400mg Copper chloride and 300μg Selenium) and noted that the mean number of infections per patient during the first 21 days significantly reduced as higher elemental doses were prescribed, from 2.3 infections per patient to 1.7 infections per patients (p &lt; 0.05).</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Berger et al. Crit Care. 2006;10:153: an aggregation of two consecutive, randomised, double-blinded supplementation studies assessing the impact of trace element supplementation on infection risk, wound healing and length of ICU stay in 41 severe burn patients admitted to hospital. The Committee noted that the publication reported no statistically significant reduction in the median length of mechanical ventilation in the supplemented group, however, found a small reduction in the number of total infections (from 2.0 ± 1.0 in the supplement group vs 3.5 ± 1.2 placebo group (p &lt;0.001)) and median length of ICU stays as proportion of burned body surface area (0.63 (0.23 to 1.64) supplemented group vs 0.99 (0.43 to 2.48) placebo group (p = 0.002)). The Committee considered that while the combined studies reported a meaningful reduction in wound healing, there was insufficient evidence to suggest this translated into shorter hospital stays.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Kurmis et al. J Burn Care Res. 2016;37:143-59: a systematic review and meta-analysis on trace element supplementation following severe burn injury, which included eight studies. The Committee noted that the analysis reported a significant decrease in infectious episodes with trace element supplementation (weighted mean difference: −1.25, 95% CI −1.70 to −0.80, p &lt;0.00001,) but that there was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.18 t0 5.01, p =0.96) or time in intensive care. Of note these findings relied on the Berger studies above and two earlier studies from the same group.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that, while much of the external validity of the evidence-base is limited by the fact that it is underpinned by a few trials conducted on a small cohort of Swiss patients (the Berger et al. 2006 and 2007 publications), it considered there to be no reason that it would not be relevant to the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that empirical evidence supporting trace element supplementation in the setting of major burns to be of moderate strength but low quality, despite there being a strong mechanistic rationale for their use. The Committee considered that while there was some improvement in endpoints such as the rate of wound healing and the number of infections, there was limited information on the effect on long-term quality of life. Members considered that it was very difficult to establish an evidence-base in this field, particularly regarding longer term health outcomes, noting that BRANZ was set up for this purpose but has experienced low participation rates, high-loss to follow-up and strong responder bias (Gabbe et al. Burn. 2015;41:1732-40).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it appropriate to limit use to specialist burns units or after consultation with the national specialist burns unit so as to reduce the risk of use outside of the intended patient population. The Committee considered that the existing eligibility criteria for multivitamin and mineral supplements be amended for consistency. The Committee considered that requiring evidence of nutritional deficiency could be introduced if hospital usage is significantly higher than expected.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered the financial risk of funding copper and selenium for this indication to be relatively small, given that trace element supplementation is already used in this setting. Members noted that there is currently limited visibility of hospital usage due to variable reporting and considered that funding via the Pharmaceutical Schedule would improve visibility and that this could be used to tighten restrictions if required. The Committee considered that burns specialists could inform the resource use associated with treating this patient population, and how hospital day and regrafting requirements could be affected by the funding of trace mineral supplementation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was unclear how many patients may access treatment if trace element supplementation was funded. The Committee considered that Toppi et al. 2019 reported fewer than 20 patients a year, but that this was only adults with severe burns, while Mistry et al. 2010 reflected all patients admitted with burns and was likely an overestimate. The Committee recommended that Pharmac staff engage with burns experts to get a better estimate of current usage.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for trace element supplementation is zinc/selenium/copper in combination, and that this would reflect current practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for copper and selenium if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment for major burns.
