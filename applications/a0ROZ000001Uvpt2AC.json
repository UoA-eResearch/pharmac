The Gastrointestinal Subcommittee considered that while the scope and quality of the clinical evidence was limited, the studies did show efficacy. The Gastrointestinal Subcommittee considered that there is significant morbidity in the patient population with rectal inflammation due to IBD, that medications such as budesonide and other topical agents do not seem to be effective, and that tacrolimus suppositories might potentially reduce the need to escalate to biologics.</p><p>3.3.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">February 2019</a>, PTAC considered the application for tacrolimus suppositories and considered that it was unclear what the costs of this proposal would be, as a process for compounding and distributing tacrolimus suppositories had not yet been developed. PTAC considered that more information was needed to provide advice about this application and so did not accept the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee\u2019s recommendation. PTAC recommended that PHARMAC research the costs of providing tacrolimus suppositories and bring this information to PTAC for a recommendation about priority for funding.</p><h2>\u00a0</h2><h2>Discussion</h2><p>3.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that tacrolimus is a macrolide calcineurin inhibitor that acts as an immunomodulator, reducing cytokine levels and reducing damage from immune responses.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC currently funds oral tacrolimus capsules for organ transplant and for patients who require long-term immunosuppression where ciclosporin has been trialled and discontinued. </p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with rectal inflammation due to IBD have a high health need due to the chronic nature of this disease, especially the small proportion of patients who have not responded to previous treatment and experience disabling proctitis. Members considered that the current treatment options for these patients are the anti-tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNFs) adalimumab and infliximab, which are funded for more severe cases of IBD where other treatments have failed. Adalimumab is not currently funded for ulcerative colitis (UC). If there is insufficient response to anti-TNFs then subsequent treatment would be surgical removal of the colon.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the application for tacrolimus suppositories is for the treatment of patients with IBD that is localised to the rectum; specifically, those with UC of the rectum (ulcerative proctitis) or distal colitis, and those with IBD for whom first- and second-line therapy with oral and topical mesalazine and corticosteroid preparations have not been effective. The Committee noted that the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee estimated had that approximately 300 patients per year may be eligible for treatment with tacrolimus suppositories according to these patient definitions. The Committee considered that a total of about 50 patients nationwide per year may be a more realistic estimate of patient numbers.</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that topical treatment of proctitis, such as tacrolimus suppositories in patients for whom mesalazine and steroids has not been effective, may delay or prevent use of the anti-TNFs adalimumab and infliximab. The Committee considered that infliximab may be an appropriate comparator for assessment of the efficacy of tacrolimus suppositories in the requested patient population. </p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members were of the view that topical treatment, eg. with suppositories, exerts a local effect due to high drug concentrations within the bowel wall. However, Members considered that the drug could also be acting systemically because of rectal mucosal absorption to systemic circulation. The Committee advised that there is some literature regarding the use of oral tacrolimus in IBD but there appears to be little medical interest in further investigating this treatment modality, and noted that there are no comparative studies comparing rectal to oral dose regimens of tacrolimus in IBD.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the evidence from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, induction trial of topical tacrolimus 0.5 mg/mL ointment, 3 mL twice a day for eight weeks in 21 adults with active UC with inflammation limited to 25 cm from the anal verge (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28286194\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2017;15:1248-55</a>). The Committee noted the trial used an ointment preparation with applicator (not a suppository), that it included an adult population with established UC, and that the trial was conducted at four centres in Australia. The Committee noted that all patients had received insufficient benefit from or did not tolerate conventional therapy with either oral and/or rectal mesalazine and/or oral or rectal steroids, and that the proportions of patients in each treatment group who were intolerant of, or received insufficient benefit from, these agents was similar.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of this randomised induction trial was clinical response at 8 weeks follow-up, and that the authors reported that 8 of 11 patients receiving tacrolimus achieved clinical response demonstrated by the Mayo Clinic score, compared with 1 of 10 patients receiving placebo (73% vs 10%; <i>P</i>=0.004). The Committee noted that five patients receiving tacrolimus achieved clinical remission compared with no patients receiving placebo (45% vs 0%; <i>P</i>=0.015) and that mucosal healing was achieved in eight patients receiving tacrolimus compared with one patient receiving placebo (73% vs 10%; <i>P</i>=0.004).

Members considered that the patient population included in the brief reporting of this study were resistant to previous treatments, and that the study appeared to be of higher quality than the other currently available evidence. Members noted that the study indicated equivalent clinical and endoscopic responses at 4 weeks with tacrolimus compared with beclomethasone, with no significant differences in adverse event rates. The Committee was of the view that the impending full publication of this trial may provide useful evidence and should be considered by the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee; however, the Committee considered that the appropriate comparator would be infliximab rather than beclomethasone suppositories.</p><p>3.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted recent guidance from the American College of Gastroenterology (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840605-acg-clinical-guideline-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/\" target=\"_blank\">Rubin et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2019;114:384-413</a>) regarding the induction of remission in mildly active UC, which did not make any recommendation regarding tacrolimus for the treatment of UC in adults. Members noted that the evidence for tacrolimus that was referenced in this guidance comes from three trials of oral tacrolimus that were either single-arm or placebo-controlled and that the reviewers considered there was limited data regarding long-term outcomes and colectomy rates.</p><p>3.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for management of UC (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng130\" target=\"_blank\">NICE guideline NG130 [Internet]. NICE (UK); May 2019</a>) did not make any recommendation regarding the use of tacrolimus for UC. Members noted that the evidence for tacrolimus that was referenced in the NICE guidance came from the randomised controlled trial of tacrolimus ointment reported by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28286194\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence et al.</a> described above, which NICE considered to be of low quality, and NICE had expressed concerns about the applicability of the evidence due to the ointment preparation used instead of a suppository.</p><p>3.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the NICE guideline NG130 included a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC, and reported that fourth-line use of topical tacrolimus for proctitis may be cost-effective but the health gains in quality-adjusted life years would be small due to the small number of patients who require fourth-line treatment in the UK. The Committee noted that the NICE reviewing committee did not recommend topical tacrolimus given the uncertainty around treatment sequencing and the cost of compounding suppositories, instead making a research recommendation to further investigate efficacy and cost-effectiveness of topical tacrolimus for treatment-resistant proctitis.</p><p>3.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there remained uncertainty around the quantity and quality of evidence for use of tacrolimus suppositories, compared with for other tacrolimus preparations and for other pharmaceuticals<b>.</b> </p><p>3.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2018-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">October 2018</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">, </u>the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee had noted that the compounding of suppositories was challenging and that most community pharmacies do not have the capability to compound suppositories. The Committee noted that there is no proprietary tacrolimus suppository product and that compounding of tacrolimus suppositories would need to be outsourced, which would be associated with significant cost compared to the cost of the tacrolimus itself.\u00a0</p>",
