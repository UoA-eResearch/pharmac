The <a class=""external-link"" href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/about/expert-advice/pharmacology-and-therapeutics-advisory-committee-ptac/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC)</a>  meets quarterly.

<p>In November 2021, we introduced separate terms of reference for the SACs to make clear that these committees have different, but complementary, roles, expertise and perspectives to PTAC.</p>

<p>PTAC and SACs may make recommendations to Pharmac that differ from each other when looking at the same evidence. Pharmac considers the recommendations provided by all our clinical advisory committees when assessing applications.</p>
