The Committee considered that bevacizumab as first line treatment improves OS in those with Stage IV disease and, possibly, those with inoperable or sub-optimally debulked Stage III disease compared with placebo. The Committee considered that, when used as second-line therapy, bevacizumab has a small beneficial effect on PFS, and that one trial (AURELIA) reported a measurable HRQoL improvement with bevacizumab, whilst noting there may be methodological problems with that analysis related to the treatment of missing data.

The Committee noted that these cancers follow relapsing and remitting disease courses, in which patients receive sequential rounds of therapy and experience progressively shorter intervals between treatments and relapses.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ovarian cancer alone was among the ten most commonly registered cancers in women in New Zealand in 2019, with an incidence of diagnosis of 7.1 per registrations per 100,000 female population per year (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/new-cancer-registrations-2019.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK"" target=""_blank"">MoH. New Cancer Registrations 2019)</a>. The Committee noted that in 2013, the mortality rate from ovarian cancer in New Zealand was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 in the female population; the lowest mortality rate for ovarian cancer over the previous decade (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-trends-2013-nov2016compat2010.xlsx"" target=""_blank"">MoH. Cancer Trends 2013</a>). It was noted that the survival rates for patients with ovarian cancer were noted by PTAC in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2017-05.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2017</a> to be 65%, 36% and 31% at 1, 5, and 10 years respectively. The Committee noted that health outcomes observed in Māori are also reflected in Pacific peoples, with an age-standardised rate of ovarian cancer of 25.4 per 100,000 (95% confidence [CI] 20.2 to 30.2) compared to 18.7 per 100,000 (95% CI 18.1 to 19.4) for European/other women (<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-012-9986-x"" target=""_blank"">Meredith et al.

The Committee noted that chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is known to be associated with significant toxicities, such as nausea, neutropenia, alopecia, anaemia, and fatigue, some of which can remain long-term (eg peripheral neuropathy). The Committee noted that with more advanced disease, patients may develop pleural effusions, abdominal masses which can lead to bowel obstruction, or ascites which may require repeated drainage. The Committee considered the average life expectancy of patients with advanced disease to be three years and noted that about 70% of patients with ovarian cancer will experience relapse within two years following standard first-line treatment. The Committee noted that subsequent lines of therapy may utilise treatments that have been used previously (eg additional chemotherapy) and are often given with palliative intent. The Committee also considered that<span style=""font-size: 10pt;""> </span>QoL is disproportionately worse for family and caregivers of patients with ovarian cancer (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14581826/"" target=""_blank"">Le et al.

The Committee noted that patients who receive partial or complete response to chemotherapy and have documentation confirming pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 gene mutation are then eligible (from 1 August 2022) to receive olaparib treatment (as a maintenance treatment ongoing for partial responders, and for two years maximum for complete response). The Committee considered that treatment options for non-BRCA1/2 patients are limited.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby reducing tumour angiogenesis and inhibiting tumour growth (<a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/a/Avastininf.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Medsafe Datasheet: Avastin (bevacizumab). 2021</a>). The Committee noted that bevacizumab is <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/ProductDetail.asp?ID=11531"" target=""_blank"">Medsafe approved</a> for the treatment of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The Committee noted that the recommended dose of bevacizumab in first-line treatment is 15 mg/kg once every three weeks via intravenous infusion when administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to six cycles of treatment, followed by continued use of bevacizumab as single agent, continued for a total of 15 months therapy or until disease progression (whichever occurs earlier).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee briefly reprised the evidence previously considered (the ICON7, GOG-0218, OCEANS, and AURELIA trials) current at that time, and noted the additional following key updated evidence for bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted again that ICON7 had been a phase III, randomised, open-label, international trial that compared the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab (7.5\u202fmg/kg every 3\u202fweeks) in 1528 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage (FIGO stage I-IIA, grade 3, or clear-cell histology) or advanced (FIGO stage IIB-IV). The Committee considered updated evidence from ICON7 in the form of retrospective exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses by disease stage and extent of residual disease after upfront surgery (<a href=""https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(18)31166-1/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">Martin et al. Gynecol Oncol. 2019;152:53-60</a>). The Committee noted that after a treatment duration of 12 months, the PFS benefit from bevacizumab was reported to be consistent across all subgroups examined. The Committee noted that the PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.77 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.99) in 411 patients with stage IIIB-IV ovarian cancer with no visible residuum and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.95) in 749 patients with stage IIIB-IV disease and visible residuum. The Committee noted that no OS difference was detected in any subgroup except the previously described high-risk subgroup. The Committee noted that safety results in analysed subgroups were consistent with the overall study population. The Committee reiterated the methodological limitations and lessened evidence quality of post-hoc subgroup analyses, and the need for caution interpreting them.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that AURELIA had been a phase III, open-label, randomised trial that compared the efficacy of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV for 21-day cycles) in 361 patients with<span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(80, 80, 80);""> </span>platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The Committee noted updated evidence from AURELIA in the form of further analysis of this trial (sponsored by Roche) examining the chemotherapy arm (n=182) and compared patients that crossed over to bevacizumab (40%) with those who did not (60%) (<a href=""https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(19)32159-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">Bamias et al. Ann Oncol. 2017;28:1842-8</a>). The Committee noted that the crossover group experienced superior survival but considered that these results were not equivalent to that of a randomised trial given that crossover allocation is selective. The Committee reiterated the methodological limitations, interpretative challenges, and lessened evidence quality with cross-over analyses in this trial, requiring caution in interpretation. The Committee considered that, given the side effect profile of bevacizumab, it would be highly likely that those deemed unsuitable for crossover had clinical characteristics placing them at higher risks of disease progression and death.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted new trial evidence in the form of JGOG3023, a phase II, randomised, open label, multicentre trial that compared the efficacy of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (dose published as “15 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span>“ IV for 21-day cycles) in 106 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose disease had progressed after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. The Committee noted that after 6 months PFS was 3.1 months in the chemotherapy group and 4.0\xa0months in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab group (HR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.90,\xa0<em>P</em>=0.0082), and that the median OS was 11.3 and 15.3\xa0month in each group, respectively (HR=0.67, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.17,\xa0<em>P</em>=0.1556). The Committee noted that the incidence of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) was 42.0% and 54.9%, with only 2 and 12 events leading to discontinuation of therapy, respectively (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.15185"" target=""_blank"">Shoji et al. Cancer Sci. 2022;113:240-50</a>). The Committee noted the stated dose of bevacizumab as published, “15 mg/m<span style=""font-size: 9.75px;"">2</span>”, was clearly incorrect (the correct dose would have been 15 mg/kg) and considered this could raise questions about the overall quality of the trial, alongside the known limitations of non-blinding in trials.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee was made aware of GOG-0213; a phase III, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial that examined the efficacy of chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV for 21-day cycles) in women with ovarian cancer recurring 6 months after completion of initial therapy. The Committee noted that after a median follow up of 49.6 months, median OS in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group was 42.2 months (95% CI 37.7 to 46.2) vs. 37.3 months (95% CI 32.6 to 39.7) in the chemotherapy group (HR=0.829; 95% CI 0.683 to 1.005; <em>P</em>=0.056). It was also noted that there was no difference in HRQoL scores. The Committee noted that 96% of those in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group had at least one grade 3 or worse AE compared with 86% in the chemotherapy group, with the most frequently reported AEs being hypertension (12% vs. 1%, respectively), fatigue (8% vs. 2%), and proteinuria (8% vs. none) (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(17)30279-6"" target=""_blank"">Coleman et al.

The Committee considered that the PFS observed in these studies was similar to that seen in the ICON7 and GOG-0218 trials. The Committee considered that the assumption of bevacizumab being a part of first-line care is so strong that in newer comparative trials it is regarded as standard therapy.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee was also made aware of a meta-analysis comparing bevacizumab to polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The Committee noted that the PARPi are indicated in those with ovarian cancer with a BRCA1/2 mutation. The Committee noted that the study concluded that PARPi may be a more effective therapeutic strategy than bevacizumab with respect to PFS, and that the risk of serious AEs posed by PARPi and bevacizumab are similar in women with newly diagnosed BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer (<a href=""https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-022-09455-x"" target=""_blank"">Suh et al.

The Committee considered this benefit to be greatest in high-risk patients in first-line setting, with a smaller, less certain benefit in second-line treatment of patients with relapsed disease.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that first-line treatment with bevacizumab in doses of either 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every three weeks improves PFS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer compared with placebo. The Committee considered that the value of PFS is offset by detriments in HRQoL related to the AE profile of the drug. The Committee considered that bevacizumab as first line treatment improves OS in those with Stage IV disease and, possibly, those with inoperable or sub-optimally debulked Stage III disease compared with placebo. The Committee considered that, when used as second-line therapy, bevacizumab has a small beneficial effect on PFS, and that one trial (AURELIA) reported a measurable HRQoL improvement with bevacizumab, whilst noting there may be methodological problems with that analysis related to the treatment of missing data. The Committee considered that the OS is likely not altered in the second-line setting, however one study in platinum-sensitive patients (GOG213) reported a borderline improvement.<span style=""font-size: 10pt;""> </span>The Committee was made aware that there has been a shift in opinion amongst the oncology research community around the validity of PFS when matched against OS as gold standard, and that PFS is now accepted as an appropriate endpoint in some cancers, this including gynaecological cancers.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the pivotal trials suffered from methodological issues: ICON7 was an open-label study and one of its published reports (<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00086-8/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">Oza et al. Lancet Oncol. 2015;16:928-39</a>) contained a typographical error that understated the overall mortality in the group of high-risk patients using bevacizumab (“54%” when it should have been 64%, from 158 deaths of 248 patients in that group; in the context of 69% deaths in the high-risk patients using chemotherapy group); GOG-0218 (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1104390"" target=""_blank"">Burger et al.

J Clin Oncol. 2019;37:2317-28</a>) was a double-blinded RCT, however the only group that had benefitted (Stage IV patients treated with both concomitant and maintenance bevacizumab) was reasonably small (n=92 by three years, n=53 by 5 years, HR 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95), with the possibility of\xa0Type I statistical error in addition to the inherent problems associated with being a post-hoc analysis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the ICON7 study protocol used a dose of 7.5mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks, which differs from the recommended dose stated in the Avastin Medsafe datasheet and the doses used in other trials. The Committee noted that the original application acknowledged this difference and suggested that this did not modify (with any statistical significance) any treatment benefit for PFS or OS. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that most patients would utilise dosing of 7.5 mg/kg.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if funded access were to be widened, use of infusion services may remain unchanged for the initial cycles as bevacizumab would be administered in combination with other chemotherapy infusions. However, due to the option of further cycles of bevacizumab treatment continuing after that initial phase, it was noted that continued use this may add to the infusion service burden of work at hospitals and cancer day-stay facilities. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there is also a risk of bevacizumab-related AEs (eg hypertension, proteinuria, muco-cutaneous bleeding, bowel perforations), which could potentially increase the burden on the health system. The Committee considered that those receiving bevacizumab treatment may also require monthly safety monitoring with a medical oncologist but there was unlikely to be any additional requirement for laboratory monitoring compared to currently funded chemotherapies.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered, following clinician correspondence, that approximately 5% of high-risk ovarian cancer patients would not receive bevacizumab due to bowel obstruction, 10% would not receive it on the grounds of poor functional status or would personally decline the drug, and a further 15% would likely have germline BRCA1/2 mutations (and would be better candidates for treatment with olaparib). It was therefore considered that approximately 70% of eligible patients would be treated with bevacizumab if funded access were to be widened. The Committee considered that bevacizumab would not be used as a replacement for another treatment, but rather it would be given in addition to current regimens.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line advanced ovarian cancer.

The Committee noted that chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is known to be associated with significant toxicities, such as nausea, neutropenia, alopecia, anaemia, and fatigue, some of which can remain long-term (eg peripheral neuropathy). The Committee noted that with more advanced disease, patients may develop pleural effusions, abdominal masses which can lead to bowel obstruction, or ascites which may require repeated drainage. The Committee considered the average life expectancy of patients with advanced disease to be three years and noted that about 70% of patients with ovarian cancer will experience relapse within two years following standard first-line treatment.

The Committee noted that the recommended dose of bevacizumab in first-line treatment is 15 mg/kg once every three weeks via intravenous infusion when administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to six cycles of treatment, followed by continued use of bevacizumab as single agent, continued for a total of 15 months therapy or until disease progression (whichever occurs earlier).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee briefly reprised the evidence previously considered (the ICON7, GOG-0218, OCEANS, and AURELIA trials) current at that time, and noted the additional following key updated evidence for bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.10.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted again that ICON7 had been a phase III, randomised, open-label, international trial that compared the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab (7.5\u202fmg/kg every 3\u202fweeks) in 1528 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer that was either high-risk early-stage (FIGO stage I-IIA, grade 3, or clear-cell histology) or advanced (FIGO stage IIB-IV). The Committee considered updated evidence from ICON7 in the form of retrospective exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses by disease stage and extent of residual disease after upfront surgery (<a href=""https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(18)31166-1/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">Martin et al.

The Committee reiterated the methodological limitations, interpretative challenges, and lessened evidence quality with cross-over analyses in this trial, requiring caution in interpretation.

The Committee considered that bevacizumab as first line treatment improves OS in those with Stage IV disease and, possibly, those with inoperable or sub-optimally debulked Stage III disease compared with placebo. The Committee considered that, when used as second-line therapy, bevacizumab has a small beneficial effect on PFS, and that one trial (AURELIA) reported a measurable HRQoL improvement with bevacizumab, whilst noting there may be methodological problems with that analysis related to the treatment of missing data. The Committee considered that the OS is likely not altered in the second-line setting, however one study in platinum-sensitive patients (GOG213) reported a borderline improvement.<span style=""font-size: 10pt;""> </span>The Committee was made aware that there has been a shift in opinion amongst the oncology research community around the validity of PFS when matched against OS as gold standard, and that PFS is now accepted as an appropriate endpoint in some cancers, this including gynaecological cancers.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the pivotal trials suffered from methodological issues: ICON7 was an open-label study and one of its published reports (<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00086-8/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">Oza et al. Lancet Oncol. 2015;16:928-39</a>) contained a typographical error that understated the overall mortality in the group of high-risk patients using bevacizumab (“54%” when it should have been 64%, from 158 deaths of 248 patients in that group; in the context of 69% deaths in the high-risk patients using chemotherapy group); GOG-0218 (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1104390"" target=""_blank"">Burger et al.

J Clin Oncol. 2019;37:2317-28</a>) was a double-blinded RCT, however the only group that had benefitted (Stage IV patients treated with both concomitant and maintenance bevacizumab) was reasonably small (n=92 by three years, n=53 by 5 years, HR 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95), with the possibility of\xa0Type I statistical error in addition to the inherent problems associated with being a post-hoc analysis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the ICON7 study protocol used a dose of 7.5mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks, which differs from the recommended dose stated in the Avastin Medsafe datasheet and the doses used in other trials. The Committee noted that the original application acknowledged this difference and suggested that this did not modify (with any statistical significance) any treatment benefit for PFS or OS. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that most patients would utilise dosing of 7.5 mg/kg.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if funded access were to be widened, use of infusion services may remain unchanged for the initial cycles as bevacizumab would be administered in combination with other chemotherapy infusions. However, due to the option of further cycles of bevacizumab treatment continuing after that initial phase, it was noted that continued use this may add to the infusion service burden of work at hospitals and cancer day-stay facilities. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there is also a risk of bevacizumab-related AEs (eg hypertension, proteinuria, muco-cutaneous bleeding, bowel perforations), which could potentially increase the burden on the health system. The Committee considered that those receiving bevacizumab treatment may also require monthly safety monitoring with a medical oncologist but there was unlikely to be any additional requirement for laboratory monitoring compared to currently funded chemotherapies.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered, following clinician correspondence, that approximately 5% of high-risk ovarian cancer patients would not receive bevacizumab due to bowel obstruction, 10% would not receive it on the grounds of poor functional status or would personally decline the drug, and a further 15% would likely have germline BRCA1/2 mutations (and would be better candidates for treatment with olaparib). It was therefore considered that approximately 70% of eligible patients would be treated with bevacizumab if funded access were to be widened. The Committee considered that bevacizumab would not be used as a replacement for another treatment, but rather it would be given in addition to current regimens.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line advanced ovarian cancer.
