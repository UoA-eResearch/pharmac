The Committee noted that Pacific peoples are less likely to be affected by MS given that the disease predominantly affects those of Northern European ancestry (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1352458510379614?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor et al Mult Scler. 2010;16:1422-31</a>).</p><h2><em>Health need</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MS predominantly affects Caucasian people; that a north to south latitudinal gradient is associated with an increase in prevalence of MS in the New Zealand total population; and that for many people, RRMS ultimately becomes secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The Committee considered that Pharmac is aware of the health need of people with RRMS and their families and wh\u0101nau, noting the advice provided in 2018 for <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008puFI/p000837\" target=\"_blank\">ocrelizumab for RRMS</a>, and considered there was no new advice to be provided about health needs at this time.</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is given at a dose of 20 mg as a weekly subcutaneous injection for three weeks and then monthly. The Committee considered that the first injection would be given in a medical clinic and subsequent doses would be self-administered at home.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that no B-cell monitoring would be required alongside treatment with ofatumumab given the low dose used for RRMS and the absence of safety concerns relating to B-cell levels in the large clinical trial populations. The Committee noted that other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as ocrelizumab can cause hepatitis B (HBV) reactivation in those with prior HBV infection, and that people commencing treatment with ocrelizumab are tested for HBV prior. The Committee considered it was reasonable for Pharmac to assume that HBV serology tests and vaccination or treatment for HBV, as applicable, would be required with ofatumumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ofatumumab was recommended for the treatment of RRMS by several international funding agencies in 2021 who considered it to be superior to teriflunomide (<a href=\"https://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2021-03/files/ofatumumab-psd-03-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PBAC, Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/cdr/complete/SR0657%20Kesimpta%20-%20CDEC%20Final%20Recommendation%20March%201%2C%202021_For%20posting.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CADTH-CDEC, Canada</a>); superior to other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) (<a href=\"https://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/media/6108/ofatumumab-kesimpta-final-june-2021-for-website.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SMC, Scotland</a>) and superior to a number of DMTs and equivalent to intravenous (IV) natalizumab and ocrelizumab (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta699/resources/ofatumumab-for-treating-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis-pdf-82609448917957\" target=\"_blank\">NICE, England and Wales</a>). The Committee considered that the assumptions in the NICE CUA were likely applicable to the New Zealand context. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the evidence came from two key clinical trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II, which were identical randomised (1:1), controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre phase 3 trials that were conducted concurrently (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1917246?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Hauser et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383:546-57</a>). The trials included a total of 1,882 people aged 18-55 years with MS with a relapsing\u2013remitting course (~94%) or a secondary progressive course (~6%), disease activity, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5. Participants had at least one relapse, or one lesion on MRI, in the year prior, or at least 2 relapses in the two years prior. About 40% of participants were treatment na\u00efve and the mean EDSS score was about three. Participants received ofatumumab SC (20 mg weekly loading doses for three weeks, then 20 mg every four weeks) or oral teriflunomide (14 mg once daily) for up to 30 months on treatment. </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the rationale for teriflunomide, which has a different mechanism of action, as comparator was unexplained, but considered that this was likely chosen so that the trial could demonstrate a superiority benefit (as opposed to noninferiority) with ofatumumab. The Committee noted that the authors reported in detail the extent of Novartis involvement in the trial and the rationale for this. </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.7.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of annualised relapse rate (ARR) was reported after median follow-up of 1.6 years, with about 30% of participants on medication for approximately two years. The Committee noted that the ARR in ASCLEPIOS I was 0.11 with ofatumumab and 0.22 with teriflunomide (difference, \u22120.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.16 to \u22120.06; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001) and ARR in ASCLEPIOS II was 0.10 with ofatumumab and 0.25 with teriflunomide (difference, \u22120.15; 95% CI, \u22120.20 to \u22120.09; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001). The Committee noted that the authors concluded both medicines reduced relapse rates, but that ofatumumab was better than teriflunomide.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.7.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that confirmed disability worsening (CDW) using pooled data from the two trials was 10.9% with ofatumumab and 15.0% with teriflunomide at three months (hazard ratio, HR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.86; <em>P</em>=0.002) and at six months CDW was 8.1% with ofatumumab and 12.0% with teriflunomide (HR 0.68; <em>P</em>=0.01). The Committee noted that there was no difference in confirmed disability improvement at six months.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.7.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the radiological endpoints in the ASCLEPIOS trials and considered that while they were clinically relevant, relapse and disability endpoints would be most important for people with MS. The Committee noted that adverse events were similar between treatment groups in the trials, however, considered that the greater incidence of alopecia with teriflunomide (occurring in about 15%) would likely be quite important to people with MS. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a post-hoc analysis of 615 participants who were treatment na\u00efve at entry into ASCLEPIOS I and II (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/35266417/\" target=\"_blank\">G\u00e4rtner et al. Mult Scler. 2022;28:1562-75</a>). The Committee noted that in this subgroup, the ARR was reduced by 50% with ofatumumab compared to teriflunomide (0.09 ofatumumab vs. 0.18 teriflunomide; rate ratio 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.74]; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001); the six-month CDW was delayed by 46% versus teriflunomide (HR 0.54 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.98]; <em>P</em>=0.044); and six-month progression independent of relapse activity was delayed by 56% with ofatumumab (HR 0.44 [95% CI: 0.20, 1.00]; <em>P</em>=0.049).

Members considered that very few people with MS receive older injectable medicines (ie interferon beta-1 alpha, interferon beta-1-beta, and glatiramer acetate) and as those people would be receiving a long-term response to treatment, it is unlikely they would switch to a higher efficacy treatment like ofatumumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that ofatumumab should be listed only if cost-neutral to ocrelizumab (at an individual level) as the most relevant mAb comparator, and that Pharmac should use up to date infusion costs when taking this into account.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the same funding criteria was in place for all MS treatments used in RRMS and considered that there was no reason to apply different criteria to ofatumumab for RRMS.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ofatumumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for RRMS.

However, the Committee noted that direct comparison with other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used for the treatment of RRMS such as ocrelizumab, which are the most relevant comparators in terms of efficacy, was absent. Members considered that the length of trial follow-up out to about three years was short relative to the many years it may take to change EDSS score states. The Committee considered that ofatumumab offered no additional health benefits over currently funded mAbs for RRMS. The Committee considered that ofatumumab was similar to other mAbs for the treatment of RRMS and likely superior to other DMTs for RRMS for relapse rate and disability worsening. </p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the main benefit of ofatumumab over currently funded MABs for MS, which require infusion, is its formulation as a subcutaneous injection.

Members considered that currently natalizumab and in some cases, ocrelizumab, is given on a six-weekly dosing schedule instead of four-weekly with total chair time per infusion of 30-60 minutes for natalizumab and two hours for ocrelizumab.

Members considered that JC virus (JCV) positive people receiving ocrelizumab who need a higher efficacy treatment would likely switch to ofatumumab instead of natalizumab due to the significant risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with the latter; JCV negative people with MS would likely receive natalizumab which is considered safe and effective in that subgroup. Members considered that very few people with MS receive older injectable medicines (ie interferon beta-1 alpha, interferon beta-1-beta, and glatiramer acetate) and as those people would be receiving a long-term response to treatment, it is unlikely they would switch to a higher efficacy treatment like ofatumumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that ofatumumab should be listed only if cost-neutral to ocrelizumab (at an individual level) as the most relevant mAb comparator, and that Pharmac should use up to date infusion costs when taking this into account.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the same funding criteria was in place for all MS treatments used in RRMS and considered that there was no reason to apply different criteria to ofatumumab for RRMS.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ofatumumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for RRMS.

The trials included a total of 1,882 people aged 18-55 years with MS with a relapsing\u2013remitting course (~94%) or a secondary progressive course (~6%), disease activity, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5. Participants had at least one relapse, or one lesion on MRI, in the year prior, or at least 2 relapses in the two years prior. About 40% of participants were treatment na\u00efve and the mean EDSS score was about three. Participants received ofatumumab SC (20 mg weekly loading doses for three weeks, then 20 mg every four weeks) or oral teriflunomide (14 mg once daily) for up to 30 months on treatment. </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.7.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the rationale for teriflunomide, which has a different mechanism of action, as comparator was unexplained, but considered that this was likely chosen so that the trial could demonstrate a superiority benefit (as opposed to noninferiority) with ofatumumab.

The Committee noted that the ARR in ASCLEPIOS I was 0.11 with ofatumumab and 0.22 with teriflunomide (difference, \u22120.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.16 to \u22120.06; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001) and ARR in ASCLEPIOS II was 0.10 with ofatumumab and 0.25 with teriflunomide (difference, \u22120.15; 95% CI, \u22120.20 to \u22120.09; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001).

However, the Committee noted that direct comparison with other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used for the treatment of RRMS such as ocrelizumab, which are the most relevant comparators in terms of efficacy, was absent. Members considered that the length of trial follow-up out to about three years was short relative to the many years it may take to change EDSS score states. The Committee considered that ofatumumab offered no additional health benefits over currently funded mAbs for RRMS. The Committee considered that ofatumumab was similar to other mAbs for the treatment of RRMS and likely superior to other DMTs for RRMS for relapse rate and disability worsening. </p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the main benefit of ofatumumab over currently funded MABs for MS, which require infusion, is its formulation as a subcutaneous injection.

Members considered that currently natalizumab and in some cases, ocrelizumab, is given on a six-weekly dosing schedule instead of four-weekly with total chair time per infusion of 30-60 minutes for natalizumab and two hours for ocrelizumab.

Members considered that JC virus (JCV) positive people receiving ocrelizumab who need a higher efficacy treatment would likely switch to ofatumumab instead of natalizumab due to the significant risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with the latter; JCV negative people with MS would likely receive natalizumab which is considered safe and effective in that subgroup. Members considered that very few people with MS receive older injectable medicines (ie interferon beta-1 alpha, interferon beta-1-beta, and glatiramer acetate) and as those people would be receiving a long-term response to treatment, it is unlikely they would switch to a higher efficacy treatment like ofatumumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that ofatumumab should be listed only if cost-neutral to ocrelizumab (at an individual level) as the most relevant mAb comparator, and that Pharmac should use up to date infusion costs when taking this into account.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the same funding criteria was in place for all MS treatments used in RRMS and considered that there was no reason to apply different criteria to ofatumumab for RRMS.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ofatumumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for RRMS.
