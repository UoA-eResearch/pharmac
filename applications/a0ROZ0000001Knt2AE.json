The Committee noted that PHARMAC made a decision to decline this application in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/notification-2019-07-22-inactive-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>. The Committee therefore considered that in the absence of new evidence relevant to gastric cancer, that the application for CT-P6 would be considered only for HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancers.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that biosimilars are likely to play an important role in the field of oncology in the future, and that uptake will be dependent on clinician and patient confidence in regulatory processes and appropriate education. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that both the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have released position statements in support of biosimilar use in oncology (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28848668\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Tabernero et al.

However, the Committee considered there is also variation in the innovator product over time due to changes in manufacturing processes. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CT-P6 has been approved by the EMA for use in the European Union, by the FDA for use in the United States, and by Medsafe for use in New Zealand for all the indications of the reference trastuzumab product. The Committee noted the comprehensive international regulatory processes regarding the safety and efficacy of biosimilars. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical development program for CT-P6 includes two un-published Phase 1 trials (Study CT-P6 1.5 and Study CT-P6 1.4) and one Phase 3 trial (Study CT-P6 3.2). </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the two randomised, double-blind, controlled, single-dose Phase 1 studies conducted to investigate CT-P6: a pivotal pharmacokinetic study in health subjects (Study CT-P6 1.5), and a pilot study evaluating initial safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects (Study CT-P6 1.4). The Committee noted that the results of these studies are unpublished, but that there is a summary available in the European Medicines Agency Assessment report for CT-P6 (<a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/herzuma-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EMA Assessment Report. Herzuma. December 2017</a>). The Committee considered that the results of these studies support the biosimilarity of CT-P6 with the reference trastuzumab product, from a pharmacokinetic perspective.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, Phase 3 trial that aimed to establish the equivalence of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of 549 patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer (Study CT-P6 3.2; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592386\" target=\"_blank\">Stebbing et al. Lancet Oncol. 2017;18:917-28</a>). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of definitive surgery (following 24 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab), and that pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety data were also collected. The Committee noted that regulators, including in Europe and the United States, have accepted pCR as a surrogate endpoint for efficacy, albeit the evidence appeared mixed on whether pCR is truly predictive of event-free survival and/or overall survival. The Committee also noted that it is unlikely that survival data will be forthcoming as it is not mandated for biosimilars approval.</p><p>1.10.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Stebbing et al. (2017) reported that 116 of 248 (46.8%) patients receiving CT\u2011P6 achieved pCR compared with 129 of 256 (50.4%) patients receiving reference trastuzumab, and that the 95% confidence interval of the estimated treatment outcome difference was within the equivalence margin of -0.15 to 0.15 (outcome difference -0.04%; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.05). The Committee considered that the results from the secondary endpoints at the end of the neoadjuvant period were similar between the treatment groups.</p><p>1.10.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the safety profiles of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab reported by Stebbing et al. (2017) were similar; treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 19 of 271 (7%) patients receiving CT-P6 and 22 of 278 (8%) patients receiving reference trastuzumab, and serious adverse events included febrile neutropenia (4 [1%] CT-P6 vs 1 [&lt;1%] reference trastuzumab) and neutropenia (1 [&lt;1%] CT-P6 vs 2 [1%] reference trastuzumab).</p><p>1.10.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Stebbing et al (2017) reported that there were no notable differences in pharmacokinetic endpoints between the treatment groups at any cycle in the neoadjuvant period. The Committee noted that the EMA Assessment report provided further details on the pharmacokinetic findings from the Phase 3 trial, including a discussion of unexpected findings that were subsequently attributed to the assay platform used.</p><p>1.10.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that antidrug antibodies can develop as a result of exposure to a drug, and that the biological role of these is unclear (antidrug antibodies can be neutralising, immunogenic, or present with no discernible effect). The Committee noted that 12 patients in the Phase 3 trial were antidrug antibody positive at baseline (all neutralising antibody negative), but that no patients were positive for antidrug antibodies in the adjuvant or post-treatment follow-up period (<a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/herzuma-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EMA Assessment Report. Herzuma. December 2017</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered a randomised double-blind equivalence trial that investigated the safety and efficacy of switching patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer from reference trastuzumab to the biosimilar trastuzumab ABP 980, after neoadjuvant treatment with the reference product (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880292\" target=\"_blank\">von Minckwitz et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:987-98</a>). The Committee noted the conclusion of the study, which was that the lower bounds of the 90% confidence intervals for the risk ratio and risk difference showed non-inferiority but that the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins, meaning the analysis of non-superiority was inconclusive. The Committee noted that the reference trastuzumab product and ABP 980 had similar safety outcomes. The Committee noted there have been a number of switching studies between biosimilar formulations of rituximab.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is limited switching data available at this time specifically for CT-P6, and none relevant to breast cancer. The Committee also considered that there is no data available for the use of biosimilar trastuzumab in combination with other monoclonal antibody therapies e.g. pertuzumab, or for sequencing of therapies following biosimilar trastuzumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that there are a number of biosimilar trastuzumab products undergoing regulatory approval internationally. The Committee noted that CT-P6 is the only biosimilar trastuzumab currently approved by Medsafe, but that there are two others currently under review.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if CT-P6 or another biosimilar trastuzumab were to be funded, that there should be only one trastuzumab product listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule to reduce the possibility of unmanaged switching, given the lack of biosimilar to biosimilar switching data available at this time. The Committee also considered that frequent switching between products is not desirable, and that the contract period for a listed product should be at least three years to minimise this (noting that this period exceeds the average duration of treatment for most patients, meaning the majority of patients would need to switch a maximum of once).</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if CT-P6 or any other trastuzumab biosimilar were to be funded, that a managed transition period of six months would be appropriate, provided immunogenicity is monitored. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the nocebo effect (i.e. a negative outcome occurring due to a belief that the intervention will cause harm via adverse effects or a perceived lack of treatment benefit) will be a concern with biosimilars in oncology, particularly in the metastatic setting where disease progression is inevitable and may be attributed to a biosimilar switch without good evidence.

The Committee noted that the results of these studies are unpublished, but that there is a summary available in the European Medicines Agency Assessment report for CT-P6 (<a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/herzuma-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EMA Assessment Report.

Lancet Oncol. 2017;18:917-28</a>). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of definitive surgery (following 24 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab), and that pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety data were also collected. The Committee noted that regulators, including in Europe and the United States, have accepted pCR as a surrogate endpoint for efficacy, albeit the evidence appeared mixed on whether pCR is truly predictive of event-free survival and/or overall survival. The Committee also noted that it is unlikely that survival data will be forthcoming as it is not mandated for biosimilars approval.</p><p>1.10.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Stebbing et al. (2017) reported that 116 of 248 (46.8%) patients receiving CT\u2011P6 achieved pCR compared with 129 of 256 (50.4%) patients receiving reference trastuzumab, and that the 95% confidence interval of the estimated treatment outcome difference was within the equivalence margin of -0.15 to 0.15 (outcome difference -0.04%; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.05). The Committee considered that the results from the secondary endpoints at the end of the neoadjuvant period were similar between the treatment groups.</p><p>1.10.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the safety profiles of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab reported by Stebbing et al. (2017) were similar; treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 19 of 271 (7%) patients receiving CT-P6 and 22 of 278 (8%) patients receiving reference trastuzumab, and serious adverse events included febrile neutropenia (4 [1%] CT-P6 vs 1 [&lt;1%] reference trastuzumab) and neutropenia (1 [&lt;1%] CT-P6 vs 2 [1%] reference trastuzumab).</p><p>1.10.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Stebbing et al (2017) reported that there were no notable differences in pharmacokinetic endpoints between the treatment groups at any cycle in the neoadjuvant period.

The Committee noted that 12 patients in the Phase 3 trial were antidrug antibody positive at baseline (all neutralising antibody negative), but that no patients were positive for antidrug antibodies in the adjuvant or post-treatment follow-up period (<a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/herzuma-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EMA Assessment Report.

Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:987-98</a>). The Committee noted the conclusion of the study, which was that the lower bounds of the 90% confidence intervals for the risk ratio and risk difference showed non-inferiority but that the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins, meaning the analysis of non-superiority was inconclusive. The Committee noted that the reference trastuzumab product and ABP 980 had similar safety outcomes. The Committee noted there have been a number of switching studies between biosimilar formulations of rituximab.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is limited switching data available at this time specifically for CT-P6, and none relevant to breast cancer. The Committee also considered that there is no data available for the use of biosimilar trastuzumab in combination with other monoclonal antibody therapies e.g. pertuzumab, or for sequencing of therapies following biosimilar trastuzumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that there are a number of biosimilar trastuzumab products undergoing regulatory approval internationally.

The Committee also considered that frequent switching between products is not desirable, and that the contract period for a listed product should be at least three years to minimise this (noting that this period exceeds the average duration of treatment for most patients, meaning the majority of patients would need to switch a maximum of once).</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if CT-P6 or any other trastuzumab biosimilar were to be funded, that a managed transition period of six months would be appropriate, provided immunogenicity is monitored. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the nocebo effect (i.e. a negative outcome occurring due to a belief that the intervention will cause harm via adverse effects or a perceived lack of treatment benefit) will be a concern with biosimilars in oncology, particularly in the metastatic setting where disease progression is inevitable and may be attributed to a biosimilar switch without good evidence.

The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of definitive surgery (following 24 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab), and that pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety data were also collected. The Committee noted that regulators, including in Europe and the United States, have accepted pCR as a surrogate endpoint for efficacy, albeit the evidence appeared mixed on whether pCR is truly predictive of event-free survival and/or overall survival.

Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:987-98</a>). The Committee noted the conclusion of the study, which was that the lower bounds of the 90% confidence intervals for the risk ratio and risk difference showed non-inferiority but that the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins, meaning the analysis of non-superiority was inconclusive. The Committee noted that the reference trastuzumab product and ABP 980 had similar safety outcomes.

The Committee also considered that frequent switching between products is not desirable, and that the contract period for a listed product should be at least three years to minimise this (noting that this period exceeds the average duration of treatment for most patients, meaning the majority of patients would need to switch a maximum of once).</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if CT-P6 or any other trastuzumab biosimilar were to be funded, that a managed transition period of six months would be appropriate, provided immunogenicity is monitored. </p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the nocebo effect (i.e. a negative outcome occurring due to a belief that the intervention will cause harm via adverse effects or a perceived lack of treatment benefit) will be a concern with biosimilars in oncology, particularly in the metastatic setting where disease progression is inevitable and may be attributed to a biosimilar switch without good evidence.

The Subcommittee also noted that PTAC considered that, in the absence of new evidence relevant to gastric cancer, the application for CT-P6 would be considered only for HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancers. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the intravenous preparation of the trastuzumab reference product has been listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule since 2005 and is currently funded in New Zealand for HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancer. Members considered that patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer are a relatively homogenous group, however, patients with metastatic breast cancer are a heterogenous group whose drug resistance mechanisms may have been altered by prior anticancer treatment regimens.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that CT-P6 has been approved by the EMA for use in the European Union, by the FDA for use in the United States, and by Medsafe for use in New Zealand for all the indications of the reference trastuzumab product. The Subcommittee noted that the Medsafe approval for CT-P6 includes use in combination with a taxane for patients who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Members also considered vinorelbine in combination was a suitable and effective alternative to combine with a taxane, as occurs with reference trastuzumab (although use of reference trastuzumab or CT-P6 in combination with vinorelbine is not Medsafe-approved for this indication).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that biosimilars are rigorously investigated for risks of reactions and to assess immunogenicity. The Subcommittee noted that investigation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), antidrug antibodies, safety and efficacy are required to assess clinical efficacy in appropriate populations and to establish biosimilarity with the reference product. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the non-clinical evidence was comprehensive and supported biosimilarity between CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab:</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted data from a 3-way similarity study with an extensive comparative analysis of primary, secondary and tertiary structure, glycan profiles and of post-translational modifications, and considered that the molecular characteristics of CT-P6 demonstrated no significant differences between the biosimilar and reference trastuzumab (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482416\" target=\"_blank\">Lee et al. MAbs. 2018;10:547-71</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that non-clinical PD data for CT-P6 demonstrated very similar blocking of HER2 cleavage and subsequent HER-2 down-regulation compared with reference trastuzumab (<a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/herzuma-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Herzuma Assessment report. European Medicines Agency [EMA], 2017</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the safety data from the phase I clinical trials in healthy subjects were similar and presented no concerns. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase III, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, CT-P6 3.2 equivalence trial which investigated 8 cycles of neoadjuvant CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab (with neoadjuvant chemotherapy), then surgery, followed by adjuvant CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab for a total of 1 year of treatment in 549 women with stage I-IIIa operable HER2-positive breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592386\" target=\"_blank\">Stebbing et al. Lancet Oncol. 2017;18:917-28</a>). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the CT-P6 3.2 trial patient characteristics were well balanced between groups, that patients had good baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and that staging was slightly higher in the CT-P6 arm. The Subcommittee considered that these factors were not sufficient to impact the clinical trial outcomes. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome of the CT-P6 3.2 trial was pathological complete response (pCR) after surgery, and that this excluded ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The Subcommittee noted that after 19.5 months of follow up the pCR rate was 46.8% with CT-P6 compared to 50.4% with reference trastuzumab. The Subcommittee noted that the pCR with CT-P6 was within the prespecified equivalence margin of \u00b115% from the expected pCR of 54%, therefore demonstrating equivalence according to this definition.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the safety data from the CT-P6 3.2 trial was broadly similar between CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab. The Subcommittee considered that there were similar frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events in each group, and comparable immunogenicity with no differences in the frequency of infusion reactions or anti-drug antibodies. The Subcommittee noted that there were no significant differences in LVEF change.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered the possibility of an interaction between pertuzumab and biosimilar trastuzumab, which bind to different subdomains of the HER2 receptor and therefore do not directly interact. Members considered that as CT-P6 binds to the same epitope on subdomain IV of the HER2 receptor as reference trastuzumab, it is unlikely there would be an interaction between CT-P6 and pertuzumab which binds to subdomain II. Members considered CT-P6 would provide the same benefit that would be expected as for reference trastuzumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy and safety data supported the biosimilarity of CT-P6 compared with reference trastuzumab.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a change to a biosimilar trastuzumab as a result of a competitive procurement process would be unlikely to have any impact on health benefits or risks for patients who would receive treatment with reference trastuzumab, due to comprehensive testing already being done to assess risks and benefits. The Subcommittee considered that it was clinically acceptable for a biosimilar trastuzumab to be listed and be the only available trastuzumab product for all funded indications if the cost saving is worthwhile and supply is secured. The Subcommittee supported a competitive process and recommended that PHARMAC bring any other biosimilar trastuzumab options that are proposed for funding to CaTSoP, when available in future, for review. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for biosimilarity of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab demonstrated that similarity was established. The Subcommittee considered that interchangeability (for which there are different regulatory definitions used in Europe and the USA) still remained unconfirmed and that there is limited real-world data regarding switching from one trastuzumab product to another, or multiple changes between trastuzumab products over time. The Subcommittee considered that interchangeability data would be desirable and should be reviewed in future, if such data becomes available.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that they had no concerns and did not identify any specific risks associated with changing existing patients who have commenced on a treatment course of reference trastuzumab to biosimilar trastuzumab, whether these were patients with early breast cancer who would receive a 9 week or 12 month course, or patients with metastatic breast cancer who would be treated until disease progression. The Subcommittee considered that, for patients who were responding well to reference trastuzumab and then change to biosimilar trastuzumab, it may be difficult to ascertain whether any subsequent loss of response was due to the change or due to natural progression of the disease. Members noted that any change would be closely managed and supported by treating clinicians and hospital pharmacists. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a 6-month transition period has been proposed by PHARMAC. The Subcommittee considered that it would be clinically acceptable to change trastuzumab products during a patient\u2019s treatment course if they have more than 6 months\u2019 Herceptin treatment remaining. The Subcommittee noted that during the transition period, Herceptin would remain funded as per Special Authority current criteria and that patients with less than 6 months\u2019 Herceptin treatment remaining would not be required to transition.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to establish confidence for prescribers and other groups regarding biosimilar trastuzumab in order to support implementation of a biosimilar. The Subcommittee considered that the minor batch-to-batch variation of reference trastuzumab in 2019 compared with trastuzumab in 2015 was relevant for comparative purposes, and similar data may be helpful for clinician education. Members considered it would also be useful to have patient outcome data available to support and assess the impact of any change.\u00a0</p>",
