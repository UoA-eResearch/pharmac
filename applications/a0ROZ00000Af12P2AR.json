However, noting that a barrier to IUD access is fear related to insertion, the Subcommittee considered that, on balance, the availability of an evidence-based treatment to reduce pain would improve equitable access to IUDs and further support uptake. The Subcommittee <b>recommended</b> that lidocaine with prilocaine cream be funded for intra-uterine device insertion, noting that availability of appropriate pain relief, with evidence of benefit, is likely to improve the acceptability of IUDs and positively impact equitable uptake in the community setting.\u00a0</p>",
