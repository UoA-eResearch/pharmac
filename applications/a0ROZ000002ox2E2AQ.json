The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018.

The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate.

The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia.

The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\">NG203</a>) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis. The Committee noted that this guideline discussed and interpreted the evidence and made recommendations for a combined population of individuals with stage 5 CKD on dialysis and stage 4 or 5 CKD not on dialysis. The Committee noted that this guidance document commented on the lack of credible mortality data available. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis presented in NG203 compared eleven different treatments, including those currently funded in New Zealand, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate. The Committee noted that there was not a clinically significant difference between any of the agents in reducing phosphate levels, and that treatments varied in their efficacy at different time points.

The Committee noted that there are inequities in the incidence and prevalence of kidney failure, and treatment practices in kidney replacement therapy for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific people population in New Zealand. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori have a substantially higher rate of type 2 diabetic nephropathy causing kidney failure, and are significantly less likely to receive a kidney transplant, and more likely to initiate dialysis with haemodialysis, M\u0101ori are provided with facility-based dialysis as the principal modality of care, with a lower provision of home-based modalities compared with non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific peoples (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. 44</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report.2021</a>).

The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018.

The Committee noted that, at that time PTAC requested that advice be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the Special Authority criteria, in particular whether eligibility should include CT coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores to identify those at greatest need. </p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health Need</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia describes an individual\u2019s measured serum phosphate levels being greater than 4.5mg/dL (1.46mol/L). The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate. The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia in CKD is associated with cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that dialysis commonly inadequately controls serum phosphorus.

The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia.

The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\">NG203</a>) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis.

The Committee noted that there are inequities in the incidence and prevalence of kidney failure, and treatment practices in kidney replacement therapy for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific people population in New Zealand. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori have a substantially higher rate of type 2 diabetic nephropathy causing kidney failure, and are significantly less likely to receive a kidney transplant, and more likely to initiate dialysis with haemodialysis, M\u0101ori are provided with facility-based dialysis as the principal modality of care, with a lower provision of home-based modalities compared with non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific peoples (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. 44</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report.2021</a>). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also have significantly lower rates of kidney transplantation prior to requiring dialysis. The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence of differences in hyperphosphataemia between ethnicities.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with CKD, receiving dialysis and whose phosphate serum levels cannot be controlled on calcium carbonate was previously reviewed by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC</a> in November 2021 where PTAC recommended the application be declined and considered that the evidence available at the time was consistent with only a modest clinically meaningful health benefit, with some difficulty in translating this into the New Zealand setting, and the high-quality evidence demonstrates no benefit of lanthanum carbonate over calcium carbonate. The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018. The Committee noted that, in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-nephrology-subcommittee-minutes-2018-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a>, it recommended that sevelamer carbonate to be listed with a medium priority on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for individuals who are on dialysis and expected to be on dialysis for at least 12-months, currently taking a calcium-based binding agent and with a phosphate level equal or greater than 4.5 mmol/L<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span>. \u00a0</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptrP/p000099\" target=\"_blank\">2019, PTAC</a> recommended that sevelamer carbonate be funded with a low priority for the management of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis subject to Special Authority criteria. The Committee noted that, at that time PTAC requested that advice be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the Special Authority criteria, in particular whether eligibility should include CT coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores to identify those at greatest need. </p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health Need</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia describes an individual\u2019s measured serum phosphate levels being greater than 4.5mg/dL (1.46mol/L). The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate. The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia in CKD is associated with cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that dialysis commonly inadequately controls serum phosphorus. The Committee noted that individuals on dialysis are often treated with phosphate-binding agents.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the currently available treatment for hyperphosphataemia secondary to CKD are calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide. The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia. The Committee considered that the benefits/harms of phosphate binders are likely to be the same between these two groups. </p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder, which forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\">NG203</a>) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis. The Committee noted that this guideline discussed and interpreted the evidence and made recommendations for a combined population of individuals with stage 5 CKD on dialysis and stage 4 or 5 CKD not on dialysis. The Committee noted that this guidance document commented on the lack of credible mortality data available. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis presented in NG203 compared eleven different treatments, including those currently funded in New Zealand, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate. The Committee noted that there was not a clinically significant difference between any of the agents in reducing phosphate levels, and that treatments varied in their efficacy at different time points. The Committee considered the quality of evidence included in the network meta-analysis to be of low quality. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that calcium carbonate treatment increases calcium in the blood, but considered that this is not necessarily harmful to individuals receiving treatment unless calcium levels are already high (i.e. hypercalcaemia). The Committee noted that in this instance, calcium containing binders would likely not be used. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee note the LANDMARK trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021; 18:1946-1954</a>)\u00a0where individuals with CKD, hyperphosphatasaemia and at least one factor of vascular calcification were randomised to receive either lanthanum carbonate (n = 1154) or calcium carbonate (n = 1155) and titrated to achieve serum phosphate levels of between 3.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia). Following 3.16 years cardiovascular events occurred in 147 of 1063 patients in the lanthanum calcium group and 134 of 1072 patients in the calcium carbonate group (incidence rate, 4.80 vs 4.30 per 100 person-years; difference 0.50 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.57 to 1.56]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [95%, CI, 0.88 to 1.41], P = 0.37). There were no significant differences in all-cause death (difference, 0.43 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.63 to 1.49]; HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.37]; P = 0.42). </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the available evidence does not suggest lanthanum is likely to significantly reduce mortality or the number of cardiovascular events. The Committee considered that mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, and vascular calcification outcomes are clinically important to consider for individuals with CKD but considered that there is no strong evidence to inform how and to what degree this is impacted by lowering phosphate. However, the Committee considered that lowering phosphate was clinically desirable and that lanthanum would be a useful additional option for clinicians.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the context of the applications for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate was to include these agents as alternatives to current treatments and not necessarily as a replacement. The Committee considered that for the majority, lanthanum would be combined with calcium-phosphate binders. The Committee noted that there is no data relating to the benefit of the addition of these agents into regiments with currently funded phosphate lowering binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://aktn.org.au/phosphate-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">PHOSPHATE</a> study, currently being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand, and noted that hard outcomes relating to any benefits for lowering phosphate in individuals with CKD may be clearer following publication of results from this study.\u00a0</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would not replace current treatment for many individuals with hyperphosphataemia but would rather be in addition to their current treatment. The Committee considered that funding these treatments would add to already significant \u201cpill burden\u201d experienced by these individuals. However, the Committee considered that the impact of this is unclear and that if all medications were to be taken at the same time of day (ie three times daily with meals) adherence may not be impacted.\u00a0</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Cost and savings</em></h3><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that use of aluminium hydroxide in New Zealand would almost exclusively be for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, and not use as antacid treatment. The Committee considered that individuals from this group are likely to access sevelamer or lanthanum as both medications can be utilised as an add-on to calcium or aluminium based binders or replacement therapy.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of individuals with chronic renal failure potentially requiring treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would be two to three times the number of individuals receiving dialysis. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there would be a subset of patients currently receiving aluminium hydroxide who would switch over to lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate due to the potential toxicities associated with aluminium but considered that this number would be small.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The <span style=\"color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate if it were to be funded in New Zealand for hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD.
