At that time, PTAC considered that the submission reviewed by NICE was supported by evidence which, if accompanied by the appropriate application content, might meet Pharmac’s application requirements. The Committee considered that it would be reasonable to consider Epidyolex for the adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (eg Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), if Pharmac were to receive an application for that indication.</p><h2><em>Health Need</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Dravet syndrome is a Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), one of a group of severe epilepsies characterised by frequent seizures which are difficult to treat and lead to significant developmental delays. Dravet syndrome is generally linked to a mutation in the sodium channel gene SCN1A, and is associated with prolonged seizures, behavioural problems, increasing comorbidity over the person’s lifetime, and increased risk of unexpected death. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that the incidence of Dravet syndrome is five per 100,000 live births, based on the applicant estimate of 50 children aged zero to 16 years in New Zealand with Dravet syndrome at any one time. The Committee noted that diagnosis usually occurs between two and five years of age, and that the average patient age is 6.5 years. The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome in New Zealand are usually under the care of a paediatrician and paediatric neurologist, and that adult patients would be transferred to receive ongoing care from a neurologist. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome have very high health needs with many children, teenagers and adults being dependent on caregivers.

Members considered that the frequency and impact of seizures (eg on behaviour) ranges, but in general, that the health need and health resource usage (eg paediatric neurologist, emergency department (ED), days in hospital, interventions) is high in Dravet syndrome. The Committee noted that the reported Dravet-specific Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) rate of 9.32 per 1000-person-years is considerably higher than the 5.1 SUDEP rate per 1000-person-years for adults with refractory epilepsy, and that patients with Dravet syndrome have an annual mortality rate of 1.58%<span style=""color: rgb(46, 46, 46);""> (</span><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920121116302443?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"">Cooper et al.

Seizure. 2019;65: 72-79</a>) have disease that is refractory to these treatments. The Committee noted that topiramate, levetiracetam and a ketogenic diet are second-line options, although funded support for a ketogenic diet for this population is only available for a very limited number of people and not in all areas across New Zealand. The Committee noted that stiripentol is funded for Dravet syndrome following use of four prior therapies but is not widely used. The Committee considered that this is likely because of its undesirable adverse effect profile for patients/families and that there may be challenges involved in in the optimal titration for benefit and adverse effect tolerance, The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome experience diminishing returns from each subsequent treatment and move through different anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) relatively quickly if they receive insufficient clinical benefit. The Committee noted that AEDs acting on the sodium channel are inappropriate for use in Dravet syndrome. The Committee considered that while treatments are currently funded and used, there is a lack of effective funded treatments for Dravet syndrome.</p><h2><em>Health Benefits and Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa that has antiseizure activity but is structurally distinct from other AEDs. The Committee noted that it does not convey psychoactive effects as it does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The Committee note that cannabidiol has novel multimodal mechanisms of action involving the G<span style="""">‐</span>protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid1 (TRPV1), modulates adenosine uptake, and causes minimal activation of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 or CB2 in usual prescribed doses (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30582156/"" target=""_blank"">Devinsky et al. Epilepsia. 2019;60:294-302</a>). The Committee considered that the potential for abuse by others was low due to these receptor differences. The Committee considered that the novel mechanism of action of cannabidiol may appeal, especially where families feel failed by conventional medicines. The Committee considered that, if funded, it would be important to fund a pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol product (ie approved by Medsafe as a medicine).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral solution) has been submitted to Medsafe but is not yet approved.

Trial treatment was either Epidyolex cannabidiol oral liquid 20 mg/kg/day or placebo for 14 weeks. The Committee considered this trial included a diverse population whose baseline seizures per month ranged widely but included those with very high frequency (over 1,700) and whose disease had not resulted in very early death.</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the percentage change in convulsive seizure frequency, with median change of −38.9% (interquartile range, −69.5 to −4.8) from baseline with cannabidiol vs −13.3% (−52.5 to 20.2) with placebo. The Committee noted that the convulsive seizure frequency in the cannabidiol group decreased from a median of 12.4 seizures/month (range, 3.9 to 1717) at baseline to 5.9 (range, 0.0 to 2159), change in seizure frequency, −22.8% (95% CI, −41.1 to −5.4).

The Committee considered that uptake would likely be 100% among patients with Dravet syndrome given the likely interest in trying cannabidiol and the known side effect profile of stiripentol.

The Committee considered that the renewal criteria should reflect this and consequently that discontinuation from funded treatment would be less than that reported in the clinical trials. The Committee considered it might be reasonable to assume long-term discontinuation from cannabidiol of 5% per year, noting that available data is short-term and suggests stabilisation to this level after two years.

The Committee noted that topiramate, levetiracetam and a ketogenic diet are second-line options, although funded support for a ketogenic diet for this population is only available for a very limited number of people and not in all areas across New Zealand. The Committee noted that stiripentol is funded for Dravet syndrome following use of four prior therapies but is not widely used. The Committee considered that this is likely because of its undesirable adverse effect profile for patients/families and that there may be challenges involved in in the optimal titration for benefit and adverse effect tolerance, The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome experience diminishing returns from each subsequent treatment and move through different anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) relatively quickly if they receive insufficient clinical benefit. The Committee noted that AEDs acting on the sodium channel are inappropriate for use in Dravet syndrome. The Committee considered that while treatments are currently funded and used, there is a lack of effective funded treatments for Dravet syndrome.</p><h2><em>Health Benefits and Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa that has antiseizure activity but is structurally distinct from other AEDs. The Committee noted that it does not convey psychoactive effects as it does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The Committee note that cannabidiol has novel multimodal mechanisms of action involving the G<span style="""">‐</span>protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid1 (TRPV1), modulates adenosine uptake, and causes minimal activation of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 or CB2 in usual prescribed doses (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30582156/"" target=""_blank"">Devinsky et al. Epilepsia. 2019;60:294-302</a>). The Committee considered that the potential for abuse by others was low due to these receptor differences. The Committee considered that the novel mechanism of action of cannabidiol may appeal, especially where families feel failed by conventional medicines.

The Committee considered that the renewal criteria should reflect this and consequently that discontinuation from funded treatment would be less than that reported in the clinical trials. The Committee considered it might be reasonable to assume long-term discontinuation from cannabidiol of 5% per year, noting that available data is short-term and suggests stabilisation to this level after two years.

Dravet syndrome is generally linked to a mutation in the sodium channel gene SCN1A, and is associated with prolonged seizures, behavioural problems, increasing comorbidity over the person’s lifetime, and increased risk of unexpected death. The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that the incidence of Dravet syndrome is five per 100,000 live births, based on the applicant estimate of 50 children aged zero to 16 years in New Zealand with Dravet syndrome at any one time. The Committee noted that diagnosis usually occurs between two and five years of age, and that the average patient age is 6.5 years. The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome in New Zealand are usually under the care of a paediatrician and paediatric neurologist, and that adult patients would be transferred to receive ongoing care from a neurologist. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome have very high health needs with many children, teenagers and adults being dependent on caregivers.

The Committee noted that topiramate, levetiracetam and a ketogenic diet are second-line options, although funded support for a ketogenic diet for this population is only available for a very limited number of people and not in all areas across New Zealand. The Committee noted that stiripentol is funded for Dravet syndrome following use of four prior therapies but is not widely used. The Committee considered that this is likely because of its undesirable adverse effect profile for patients/families and that there may be challenges involved in in the optimal titration for benefit and adverse effect tolerance, The Committee noted that people with Dravet syndrome experience diminishing returns from each subsequent treatment and move through different anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) relatively quickly if they receive insufficient clinical benefit. The Committee noted that AEDs acting on the sodium channel are inappropriate for use in Dravet syndrome. The Committee considered that while treatments are currently funded and used, there is a lack of effective funded treatments for Dravet syndrome.</p><h2><em>Health Benefits and Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa that has antiseizure activity but is structurally distinct from other AEDs. The Committee noted that it does not convey psychoactive effects as it does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The Committee note that cannabidiol has novel multimodal mechanisms of action involving the G<span style="""">‐</span>protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid1 (TRPV1), modulates adenosine uptake, and causes minimal activation of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 or CB2 in usual prescribed doses (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30582156/"" target=""_blank"">Devinsky et al. Epilepsia. 2019;60:294-302</a>). The Committee considered that the potential for abuse by others was low due to these receptor differences. The Committee considered that the novel mechanism of action of cannabidiol may appeal, especially where families feel failed by conventional medicines.

The Committee noted that more than 40% of patients had a 50% or greater reduction in convulsive seizures and in total seizures at each 12-week follow up window (reductions observed through 48 weeks) and at least 80% of patients/caregivers reported improvement in overall condition after 24, 36 and 48 weeks of treatment using the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change (S/CGIC) scale. The Committee noted that 19 (7.2%) patients discontinued due to adverse events and there were two deaths due to Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), both considered unrelated to treatment.

However, the Committee considered that it was unknown whether cannabidiol was associated with a reduction in the risk of mortality for people with Dravet syndrome, noting that the reduction in the risk of mortality from a reduction in seizures would be difficult to quantify in the context of a large number of ongoing seizures and that the clinical trial data was limited by relatively short trial durations.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted results from a safety analysis of an open-label trial which included 162 patients [33 (20%) of which had Dravet syndrome] aged 1-30 years with severe, intractable, childhood-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy receiving stable doses of AEDs (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(15)00379-8"" target=""_blank"">Devinsky et al.

The median monthly frequency of motor seizures was 30.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 11.0-96.0] at baseline and 15.8 (5.6-57.6) over 12-weeks treatment; median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 36.5% (IQR 0-64.7).

However, the Committee considered that its long-term effects were unknown, including any reduction in the risk of mortality, SUDEP, or neurological deterioration. The Committee considered that the quality of the trials was high given the outcomes were difficult to define in this complex condition. The Committee noted that the therapeutic effect was strong vs placebo for a reduction in seizure frequency and considered the adverse event profile was well described, including somnolence and the liver function test abnormalities associated with concurrent sodium valproate. The Committee considered that complete seizure freedom appeared uncommon with Epidyolex in Dravet syndrome.</p><h2><em>Costs and Savings</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted there was some evidence reporting that fewer seizures conveyed a reduction in emergency service usage\xa0(<a href=""https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(18)30621-6/fulltext#supplementaryMaterial"" target=""_blank"">Ligae et al. Seizure. 2019;65: 72-79</a>). However, the key clinical trial evidence reported no reduction in hospitalisation due to epilepsy with Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral liquid) (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611618?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"" target=""_blank"">Devinsky et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376:2011-20</a>), although reduced inpatient hospitalisations was one of many secondary endpoints that the study was not powered to detect. The Committee considered that the limited evidence made it difficult to quantify potential health sector savings, although a reduction in Emergency Department visits, Paediatric Intensive Care Unit admissions, and hospitalisations was probable depending on an individual patient’s baseline seizure rate. Members considered that these savings could be substantial. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.19.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was medium quality evidence for a health benefit (improved health-related quality of life) for family, whānau or wider society. However, it was unclear if this would be associated with a reduction in the number of caregivers required per patient or other health-related savings (eg relating to respite care, hospital admission costs, or parental health).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it would be reasonable for the use of Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral liquid) to be positioned after sodium valproate and clobazam (ie second line), noting that requiring use of other AEDs first (eg levetiracetam or topiramate) would reportedly be unlikely to convey sufficient benefits for most patients with Dravet syndrome and therefore would only be additional treatment steps to move through prior. The Committee considered that uptake would likely be 100% among patients with Dravet syndrome given the likely interest in trying cannabidiol and the known side effect profile of stiripentol. The Committee considered that clobazam would likely be preferred over sodium valproate for combination therapy with Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral liquid) due to liver function abnormalities reported when used with sodium valproate.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume that 50 patients with Dravet syndrome would start Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral liquid) in year one of funding, with three new patients per year in subsequent years. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to base patient number estimates on the assumption that 90% of patients with Dravet syndrome would have disease that is refractory to first line therapy. Members considered that the risk of those outside the intended patient population receiving treatment was low given that access to cannabidiol would be via a paediatric neurologist.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, due to the complexities and high need/severity of Dravet syndrome, assessment of ongoing funded treatment should be based on practitioner and patient/family assessment of meaningful benefit rather than a particular reduction in seizure frequency (eg the trial outcome of a ≥25% reduction in seizures, which may be too high a threshold to detect a meaningful reduction in seizures in this context). The Committee considered that the renewal criteria should reflect this and consequently that discontinuation from funded treatment would be less than that reported in the clinical trials. The Committee considered it might be reasonable to assume long-term discontinuation from cannabidiol of 5% per year, noting that available data is short-term and suggests stabilisation to this level after two years. The Committee considered that it would be reasonable to reassess ongoing treatment every six or 12 months as people with Dravet syndrome would be routinely assessed this frequently. </p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral liquid) if it were to be funded in New Zealand for Dravet syndrome.
