          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cefazolin 2g vial for surgical antibacterial prophylaxis was considered by the Anti-Infective Subcommittee at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-09-22-Anti-Infective-Subcommittee-full-WEB-VERSION-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a> meeting, in the context of:</p><p>1.2. <span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>A funding application from a clinical microbiologist for the funding of a larger size of cefazolin vial for injection (2 g) for use in prophylaxis of surgical site infection.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>A letter from the Health Quality and Safety Commission\u2019s Surgical Site Infection Improvement Programme which outlined that listing the 2 g vial would reduce the risk of contamination, time in dose preparation and waste in consumables and diluent used.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>At that time, the Subcommittee had considered that there was no unmet health need in this patient population and that the potential benefits were predominantly related to suitability. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to list the 2\u00a0g vial if cost-neutral relative to the currently funded 1 g vial.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cefazolin 500 mg vials and 1 g vials for injection are currently funded. The Subcommittee had noted that all three strengths of cefazolin (500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g vials) were included in the 2019/2020 Invitation-to-tender and that Pharmac resolved to award tenders to 500 mg and 1 g presentations only, and to decline the bid for 2 g presentation in June 2020.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, while it is uncertain the exact proportion of 1g usage that would switch to 2g vials, estimates by Pharmac staff indicated the maximum incremental cost if all 1g usage was to be converted to 2g usage would be approximately $52,000 per year.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e332a62c703f653182faf47/5e332a62c703f652982fd382_Merry-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Morris et al.
