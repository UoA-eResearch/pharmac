The Subcommittee noted the need to admit high risk, and some intermediate risk, patients and the need for outpatient laboratory monitoring of low risk patients. The Subcommittee considered that there can be difficulties obtaining timely laboratory results for regional patients whose blood must be sent to a main centre for analysis. The Subcommittee considered that for patients living in rural areas, where local laboratory monitoring may not be readily available, ibrutinib would provide a more suitable treatment option than venetoclax.

The Subcommittee considered that patients intolerant or refractory to venetoclax containing regimens had the highest unmet health.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With regards to patients with intolerance to venetoclax; the Subcommittee noted that in a retrospective cohort study where patients had received a median of three prior therapies, venetoclax was reportedly discontinued by 29% of patients, 21% of which were due to toxicity (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880613/"" target=""_blank"">Mato et al.

Lancet Oncology. 2016;17:768-78</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the results of the Murano trial of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with venetoclax-rituximab, in which, 16.5% of patients experienced progression or death and there was a 2 year progression free survival (PFS) of 84.9% (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976"" target=""_blank"">Seymour et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1107-1120</a>).\xa0The Subcommittee noted that there are currently limited treatment options for patients who have progressed on venetoclax with or without rituximab, and that these options include obinutuzumab-chlorambucil (if not received previously), allogenic transplant or methyl prednisone. The Subcommittee considered that, in this setting, the appropriate comparator for ibrutinib would be obinutuzumab-chlorambucil.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted the results of the RESONATE trial, a randomised, multicentre, open‐label, phase III study, which investigated the use of ibrutinib compared with ofatumumab in patients with previously treated CLL or SLL (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6899718/"" target=""_blank"">Munir et al. Am J Hematol. 2019;94(12):1353‐63</a>). The Subcommittee noted the progression free survival benefit of ibrutinib over ofatumumab in the genomic high-risk population with del(17p), TP53 mutation, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV status (median progression free survival 44.1 vs 8.0 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.110; 95% CI: 0.080-0.152). The Subcommittee also noted that approximately 30% of patients on this trial continued to receive treatment after five years. The Subcommittee noted that in the RESONATE-2 trial, 58% of patients continued to receive ibrutinib at 60 months follow up (<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-019-0602-x"" target=""_blank"">Burger et al. Leukemia 2020;34:787–98</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the results of the RESONATE and RESONATE 2 trials could be used to inform the expected median duration of ibrutinib treatment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee considered that as an alternative therapy, there was good evidence supporting ibrutinib in the relapsed/refractory group and that the outcome data were more mature than that of venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that as a subsequent line of therapy, given that ibrutinib has a different mechanism of action to venetoclax, patients refractory to venetoclax could respond to ibrutinib. The Subcommittee noted the recent publication of an observational retrospective consecutive case series, in which ibrutinib was reported to be effective for patients with CLL who progressed on venetoclax after a remission period of greater than 24 months, 91% of whom obtained an objective response (OR) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244251/"" target=""_blank"">Lin et al. Blood. 2020;135:2266-70</a>).

However, the Subcommittee considered that there would be less pressure to use effective but potentially toxic therapies in first line, and therefore it would be important to specify the definition of relapsed/refractory and ensure that patients had undergone appropriate first line therapy such as receiving at least two cycles of chemoimmunotherapy in first line.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee considered that if ibrutinib were funded in the relapsed/refractory setting, there would be a reduction in the requirement for TLS prophylactic regimens and associated hospital admissions. The Subcommittee considered that treatment is required until progression for ibrutinib, unlike venetoclax and this would result in ongoing clinic requirements for surveillance of toxicity as well as progression, but that the associated costs would be minimal.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With regards to patients with bulky disease; the Subcommittee noted results suggesting reduced complete response (CR) rate and shorter duration of response in patients with bulky CLL/SLL treated with venetoclax (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/134/2/111/260687/Efficacy-of-venetoclax-in-relapsed-chronic"" target=""_blank"">Roberts et al.

Haematolgica. 2018;103:1511-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients receiving treatment with venetoclax require monitoring for TLS. The Subcommittee noted the need to admit high risk, and some intermediate risk, patients and the need for outpatient laboratory monitoring of low risk patients. The Subcommittee considered that there can be difficulties obtaining timely laboratory results for regional patients whose blood must be sent to a main centre for analysis. The Subcommittee considered that for patients living in rural areas, where local laboratory monitoring may not be readily available, ibrutinib would provide a more suitable treatment option than venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that while ibrutinib would be more convenient in these circumstances, the majority of patients can be managed appropriately with a TLS prophylactic strategy in place.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Ibrutinib for patients with relapsed/refractory del11q CLL</i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted that the current Special Authority for venetoclax in combination with rituximab includes patients with relapsed/refractory del 11q CLL.

The Subcommittee noted that data from the CLL8 trial reported this risk of faster progression is reversed with immunochemotherapy (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/127/2/208/34815/Long-term-remissions-after-FCR-chemoimmunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">Fischer et al.

The Subcommittee considered that, when treated with FCR, the overall survival of patients with the del11q mutation is not adversely reduced compared with patients with normal cytogenetics. The Subcommittee considered that there was little evidence that the del11q subgroup is a high risk subgroup with greater unmet health need when compared with the wider CLL population.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted the results of a pooled analysis of the randomised RESONATE, RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials, which reported that ibrutinib-treated patients with del11q had a significantly longer progression free survival than ibrutinib-treated patients without del11q (42-month progression free survival rate 70% vs. 65%, p=0.02) (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue;"">Kipps et al.</a><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank""> </a><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue;"">Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19(11):715-22</a>).

The Subcommittee considered that patients intolerant or refractory to venetoclax containing regimens had the highest unmet health.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With regards to patients with intolerance to venetoclax; the Subcommittee noted that in a retrospective cohort study where patients had received a median of three prior therapies, venetoclax was reportedly discontinued by 29% of patients, 21% of which were due to toxicity (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880613/"" target=""_blank"">Mato et al.

Lancet Oncology. 2016;17:768-78</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the results of the Murano trial of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with venetoclax-rituximab, in which, 16.5% of patients experienced progression or death and there was a 2 year progression free survival (PFS) of 84.9% (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976"" target=""_blank"">Seymour et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1107-1120</a>).\xa0The Subcommittee noted that there are currently limited treatment options for patients who have progressed on venetoclax with or without rituximab, and that these options include obinutuzumab-chlorambucil (if not received previously), allogenic transplant or methyl prednisone. The Subcommittee considered that, in this setting, the appropriate comparator for ibrutinib would be obinutuzumab-chlorambucil.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted the results of the RESONATE trial, a randomised, multicentre, open‐label, phase III study, which investigated the use of ibrutinib compared with ofatumumab in patients with previously treated CLL or SLL (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6899718/"" target=""_blank"">Munir et al. Am J Hematol. 2019;94(12):1353‐63</a>). The Subcommittee noted the progression free survival benefit of ibrutinib over ofatumumab in the genomic high-risk population with del(17p), TP53 mutation, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV status (median progression free survival 44.1 vs 8.0 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.110; 95% CI: 0.080-0.152). The Subcommittee also noted that approximately 30% of patients on this trial continued to receive treatment after five years. The Subcommittee noted that in the RESONATE-2 trial, 58% of patients continued to receive ibrutinib at 60 months follow up (<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-019-0602-x"" target=""_blank"">Burger et al. Leukemia 2020;34:787–98</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the results of the RESONATE and RESONATE 2 trials could be used to inform the expected median duration of ibrutinib treatment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee considered that as an alternative therapy, there was good evidence supporting ibrutinib in the relapsed/refractory group and that the outcome data were more mature than that of venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that as a subsequent line of therapy, given that ibrutinib has a different mechanism of action to venetoclax, patients refractory to venetoclax could respond to ibrutinib. The Subcommittee noted the recent publication of an observational retrospective consecutive case series, in which ibrutinib was reported to be effective for patients with CLL who progressed on venetoclax after a remission period of greater than 24 months, 91% of whom obtained an objective response (OR) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244251/"" target=""_blank"">Lin et al. Blood. 2020;135:2266-70</a>).

However, the Subcommittee considered that there would be less pressure to use effective but potentially toxic therapies in first line, and therefore it would be important to specify the definition of relapsed/refractory and ensure that patients had undergone appropriate first line therapy such as receiving at least two cycles of chemoimmunotherapy in first line.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee considered that if ibrutinib were funded in the relapsed/refractory setting, there would be a reduction in the requirement for TLS prophylactic regimens and associated hospital admissions. The Subcommittee considered that treatment is required until progression for ibrutinib, unlike venetoclax and this would result in ongoing clinic requirements for surveillance of toxicity as well as progression, but that the associated costs would be minimal.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With regards to patients with bulky disease; the Subcommittee noted results suggesting reduced complete response (CR) rate and shorter duration of response in patients with bulky CLL/SLL treated with venetoclax (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/134/2/111/260687/Efficacy-of-venetoclax-in-relapsed-chronic"" target=""_blank"">Roberts et al. Blood 2019 134(2) 111-122</a>).\xa0The subcommittee noted that if both ibrutinib and venetoclax were funded there may be a clinician preference for the use of ibrutinib in patients with bulky nodal CLL/SLL.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With regards to patients who are challenged by inequity of access to hospital services; the Subcommittee noted that venetoclax is associated with an increased risk of TLS, with reports that 35.8% and 19.4% of patients on venetoclax treatment were at an intermediate or high TLS risk, respectively; with 80% of patients requiring hospitalisation during dose escalation (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880613/"" target=""_blank"">Mato et al. Haematolgica. 2018;103:1511-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients receiving treatment with venetoclax require monitoring for TLS. The Subcommittee noted the need to admit high risk, and some intermediate risk, patients and the need for outpatient laboratory monitoring of low risk patients. The Subcommittee considered that there can be difficulties obtaining timely laboratory results for regional patients whose blood must be sent to a main centre for analysis. The Subcommittee considered that for patients living in rural areas, where local laboratory monitoring may not be readily available, ibrutinib would provide a more suitable treatment option than venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that while ibrutinib would be more convenient in these circumstances, the majority of patients can be managed appropriately with a TLS prophylactic strategy in place.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Ibrutinib for patients with relapsed/refractory del11q CLL</i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted that the current Special Authority for venetoclax in combination with rituximab includes patients with relapsed/refractory del 11q CLL. The Subcommittee noted that ibrutinib has not been specifically reviewed in this subpopulation previously.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted that the del11q mutation is present in 10-20% of patients with CLL, and that patients with del11q were considered to have shorter progression free survival (i.e. faster progression) that those without. The Subcommittee noted that data from the CLL8 trial reported this risk of faster progression is reversed with immunochemotherapy (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/127/2/208/34815/Long-term-remissions-after-FCR-chemoimmunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">Fischer et al. Blood. 2016;127:208-15</a>). The Subcommittee considered that, when treated with FCR, the overall survival of patients with the del11q mutation is not adversely reduced compared with patients with normal cytogenetics. The Subcommittee considered that there was little evidence that the del11q subgroup is a high risk subgroup with greater unmet health need when compared with the wider CLL population.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Subcommittee noted the results of a pooled analysis of the randomised RESONATE, RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials, which reported that ibrutinib-treated patients with del11q had a significantly longer progression free survival than ibrutinib-treated patients without del11q (42-month progression free survival rate 70% vs. 65%, p=0.02) (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue;"">Kipps et al.</a><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank""> </a><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265019303982?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue;"">Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19(11):715-22</a>).
