The Subcommittee noted that ALL can also spread to other organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. The Subcommittee noted that patients with B-Cell ALL typically present with symptoms related to anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to replacement of the bone marrow with tumour cells and that symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising/bleeding, and infections. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 17 incident patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL per year in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that equity as it pertains to socioeconomic status and ethnicity is not a relevant consideration for patients with B-cell ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that approximately 45% of adult patients with ALL experience disease relapse, with a further 4-11% demonstrated to be treatment refractory (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the primary goal from treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi). The Subcommittee noted that patients who achieve a CR/CRi may be eligible for allogenic HSCT, which may potentially be curative.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard first-line salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is reintroduction of intensive chemotherapy treatment as part of an overall plan for long-term disease control to allow for an allografting procedure if eligible. The Subcommittee noted the intensive chemotherapy treatment includes the use of FLAG (Fludarabine, cytarabine [Ara-C] and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) with anthracycline (idarubicin), mitoxantrone with cytarabine, high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) based chemotherapy, and high-dose methotrexate in combination with pegylated-asparginase, vinca alkaloids, steroids, etoposide or alkylating agents. All of which require extended hospital stays for patients. The Subcommittee noted that currently available treatments for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell ALL are also limited by toxicity, associated with extended hospital stays and are associated with adverse events including haematotoxicity, infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, mucositis and neurotoxicity which can limit further treatment and dose intensity, and which may compromise patient outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that multiple studies have reported 5-year survival rates of less than 10% in adults with R/R ALL (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee considered that only 5-30% of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL will be able to proceed to allogenic HSCT with currently funded treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are other treatments which are currently not funded in New Zealand that have been shown to be effective for this patient group, including blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager, and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) - T cell therapy, though the latter (eg. tisagenlecleucel) is currently restricted to the treatment of patients under 24 years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanised anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, which is a cytotoxic antibody agent. The Subcommittee noted that CD22 testing for the percentage of blasts with CD22 expression is currently routine for ALL patients, and that funding of inotuzumab ozogamicin would not create additional requirements for diagnostic testing. The Subcommittee noted that although CD22-positivity testing is widely used, receptor density of CD22 expression is not available in routine clinical practice and considered that this would not be necessary as response to inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed irrespective of receptor density of CD22 expression in the pivotal trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results from the phase III multicentre, global, open-label, randomised INOVATE trial in which patients ≥18 years old with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell -positive ALL and scheduled to receive first or second salvage treatment received either inotuzumab ozogamicin for up to six cycles (n=164) or standard of care (n=162) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30920645/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2019;125:2474-87</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients with Philadelphia positive ALL would be eligible for treatment with an alternate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The Subcommittee noted that median follow-up duration for patients who completed the study or were censored for overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range, 1.7-49.7 months). The Subcommittee noted that the most common standard of care received was FLAG chemotherapy (n=102) and that this was representative of what the New Zealand patient population with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL would receive.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of all patients with CR/CRi was higher for patients that received inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to standard of care (121 of 164 [73.8%] vs 50 of 143 [35.0%]), and that for patients achieving CR/CRi, the duration of remission was significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.91]; 1-sided P = 0.0071; median, 5.4 months [95% CI, 4.2-7.0 months] versus 4.2 months standard of care arm [95% CI, 2.7-5.7 months]). The Subcommittee also noted that the median progression free survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-5.8 months) compared to 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.1 months) in the standard of care treatment arm (HR, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34-0.60]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.0-9.2 months) compared to 6.2 months in the standard of care arm (95% CI, 4.7-8.3 months; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99; 1-sided P = 0.0105). The Subcommittee also noted that the 2-year survival was 22.8% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 16.7 to 29.6), compared to 10.0% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 5.7 to 15.5; P = 0.0004). The Subcommittee noted that three-year survival was 20.3% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 14.4 to 27.0) compared to 6.5% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 2.9 to 12.3; P = 0.0093).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that no difference in overall survival was observed in the Philadelphia-positive group, but when only Philadelphia-negative patients were considered, the HR for overall survival was 0.68 (97.5% CI, 0.51-0.92). The Subcommittee also noted that patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm had a lower rate of subsequent therapies (34.1%) than the standard of care arm (56.8%). The Subcommittee considered that, because subsequent treatments may have affected overall survival, sensitivity analyses which censored patients at the time of their first subsequent salvage therapy (eg blinatumomab, TKIs, CAR-T, or inotuzumab ozogamicin), had been performed, which may have preserved overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/ sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during or after treatment (including after post-HSCT follow-up) occurred in 14.0% of the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm and 2.1% in the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that more patients proceeded to HSCT at any time after study treatment in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm than the standard of care arm (79 of 164 vs 36 of 162; 1-sided P &lt; .0001), and that almost 4 times as many patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm proceeded to HSCT after achieving CR/CRi before the start of any follow-up induction therapy (65 of 164 [39.6%; 95% CI, 32.1%-47.6%] vs 17 of 162 [10.5%; 95% CI, 6.2%-16.3%]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median 2-year survival for inotuzumab ozogamicin patients who achieved CR/CRi was 12.6 months (95% CI 9.3 to 27.7) for those with follow-up HSCT and 7.1 months (95% CI 5.6 to 10.8) for those without follow-up HCST (HR 0.55; 97.5% CI 0.32 to 0.95; P = 0.0065).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that factors associated with improved overall survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm of the INO-VATE trial were best minimal residual disease (MRD) status, baseline platelet count, baseline haemoglobin level, duration of first remission, achieving CR/CRi, and whether a patient underwent HSCT during follow-up (all 2-sided P values &lt; .05).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subgroup analysis of the INO-VATE trial showed that CR/CRi outcomes were better in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group compared to standard of care for all age groups, as was MRD negativity (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29381191/"" target=""_blank"">Jabbour et al. Cancer. 2018;124:1722-32</a>). The Subcommittee also noted that the overall survival was better in patients aged under 55 years in both the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group and the standard of care group (&gt;55 years old: 8.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 7.0-11.1) vs 8.0 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.9-9.5); ≥55 years old: 5.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 4.8-8.0) vs 5.3 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.2-7.1).</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee noted patient reported outcomes from the INO-VATE trial assessed via self-administered European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Group 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508899/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2018;124:2151-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Overall health status measurements of global health status/QoL from the QLQ-C30, health state from the EQ-5D VAS, and the EQ-5D index scores all were numerically better among patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm, although without statistical significance. The Subcommittee also noted that individual functioning scores favoured inotuzumab ozogamicin (P&lt;0.05) in physical functioning (LSM difference, 6.9; 95% CI 1.4-12.3), role functioning (Least squares mean difference, 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-19.5) social functioning (LSM difference, 8.4; 95% CI 0.7-16.1). The Subcommittee noted that gastrointestinal symptoms such as appetite loss (LSM difference, -8.7; 95% CI 16.0 to -1.4; P &lt;0.05) were in favour of inotuzumab ozogamicin and exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 5.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant in relation to inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment for R/R B-cell positive ALL:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769965/"" target=""_blank"">De Angelo et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the health benefits that would be experienced if inotuzumab ozogamicin were funded may be expected to be greater in New Zealand due to the current lack of access to alternative salvage therapies.

Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2020;20:556-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was a relatively small trial (n=84) which reported that the time to progression after induction with inotuzumab ozogamicin within one year was 36% of patients, which was lower than the 57% of patients reported in the INO-VATE trial. The Subcommittee considered that the proportion of patients that were Philadelphia chromosome positive in the Badar et al trial was greater than that of the INO-VATE trial may explain the variation in results between the two trials. The Subcommittee also noted that there were less instances of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in the Bader et al trial compared to the INO-VATE trial which was likely due to patients receiving prophylactic treatment for VOD in the Bader et al trial rather than treating VOD at onset. The Subcommittee also noted that the Bader et al. trial had relatively high incidence of matched donor transplants which are usually associated with lower rates of mortality than non-donor matched transplants, compared to both the New Zealand population and the INO-VATE trial population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc analysis of the INO-VATE trial seeking to assess the relationship between CD22 expression and treatment outcomes for inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard of care (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602684/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2021;27:2742-54</a>). The Subcommittee noted that in patients with higher (≥90%) CD22 positivity, the rate of CR/CRi was 78.5% (95% CI 69.5% to 85.9%) for inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 35.5% (95% CI 25.8%–46.1%) for standard of care (rate difference 43%; 97.5% CI 28.8%–57.3%; one-sided P &lt; 0.0001). The Subcommittee also noted that in patients with lower (&lt;90%) CD22 positivity, CR/CRi rate of inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard of care was 65.7% (95% CI 47.8%–80.9%) versus 30.6% (95% CI 16.3%–48.1%; rate difference 35.2%; (97.5% CI, 10.3%–60%; one-sided P = 0.0015). The Subcommittee noted that within the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group, the rate of CR (indicating a response with better quality of hematopoietic recovery than CRi) was 42.1% and 20% for patients with CD22 positivity ≥90% and &lt;90%, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the degree of CD22 positivity should not limit access to inotuzumab ozogamicin, as lower CD22-positivity remained sufficient to be able to induce response compared to standard of care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that inotuzumab ozogamicin offers significant benefits over currently funded treatments and that these include; high rates of complete response/complete haematological response, higher MRD negativity rates, longer progression free survival, longer overall survival, requires less transfusion support, decreases time spent in hospital, reduced need for second salvage therapy, and an increased likelihood of eligibility for allogenic HSCT.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also considered that the largest difference in cost to the health sector if inotuzumab ozogamicin were funded would be in the inpatient setting, as patients would spend considerably less time there compared to current standard of care. The Subcommittee considered that this would be expected to be similar to the differences observed for patients in the INO-VATE trial. The Subcommittee considered, however, that utilization of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this patient population may increase the demand on transplant services due to more patients achieving an adequate response and being able to progress to allogenic HSCT.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that while all patient subgroups showed benefit with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment, predictors of increased overall survival with inotuzumab were having the best MRD status, healthy baseline platelet count, high CD22 expression, longer duration of first remission, achieving complete response or complete haematologic response, low disease burden, and receiving follow-up allogenic HSCT. The Subcommittee considered that while treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin would benefit all patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, the greatest benefit would be experienced by those patients eligible for potentially curative allogenic HSCT.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, if inotuzumab were to be funded for relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, approximately 15-17 patients per year would be eligible to receive treatment. The Subcommittee considered that if funded for patients as a bridge to allogenic HSCT, approximately 7-8 patients per year may be eligible to receive treatment. The Subcommittee considered that patients would receive, on average, 2-3 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin, and that once MRD is achieved, patients would need to proceed to transplant quickly.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for inotuzumab ozogamicin if it were to be funded in New Zealand </span>as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplant for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia<span style=""color: black;"">.

The Subcommittee noted that ALL can also spread to other organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. The Subcommittee noted that patients with B-Cell ALL typically present with symptoms related to anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to replacement of the bone marrow with tumour cells and that symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising/bleeding, and infections. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 17 incident patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL per year in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that equity as it pertains to socioeconomic status and ethnicity is not a relevant consideration for patients with B-cell ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that approximately 45% of adult patients with ALL experience disease relapse, with a further 4-11% demonstrated to be treatment refractory (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the primary goal from treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi). The Subcommittee noted that patients who achieve a CR/CRi may be eligible for allogenic HSCT, which may potentially be curative.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard first-line salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is reintroduction of intensive chemotherapy treatment as part of an overall plan for long-term disease control to allow for an allografting procedure if eligible. The Subcommittee noted the intensive chemotherapy treatment includes the use of FLAG (Fludarabine, cytarabine [Ara-C] and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) with anthracycline (idarubicin), mitoxantrone with cytarabine, high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) based chemotherapy, and high-dose methotrexate in combination with pegylated-asparginase, vinca alkaloids, steroids, etoposide or alkylating agents. All of which require extended hospital stays for patients. The Subcommittee noted that currently available treatments for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell ALL are also limited by toxicity, associated with extended hospital stays and are associated with adverse events including haematotoxicity, infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, mucositis and neurotoxicity which can limit further treatment and dose intensity, and which may compromise patient outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that multiple studies have reported 5-year survival rates of less than 10% in adults with R/R ALL (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee considered that only 5-30% of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL will be able to proceed to allogenic HSCT with currently funded treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are other treatments which are currently not funded in New Zealand that have been shown to be effective for this patient group, including blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager, and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) - T cell therapy, though the latter (eg. tisagenlecleucel) is currently restricted to the treatment of patients under 24 years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanised anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, which is a cytotoxic antibody agent. The Subcommittee noted that CD22 testing for the percentage of blasts with CD22 expression is currently routine for ALL patients, and that funding of inotuzumab ozogamicin would not create additional requirements for diagnostic testing. The Subcommittee noted that although CD22-positivity testing is widely used, receptor density of CD22 expression is not available in routine clinical practice and considered that this would not be necessary as response to inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed irrespective of receptor density of CD22 expression in the pivotal trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results from the phase III multicentre, global, open-label, randomised INOVATE trial in which patients ≥18 years old with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell -positive ALL and scheduled to receive first or second salvage treatment received either inotuzumab ozogamicin for up to six cycles (n=164) or standard of care (n=162) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30920645/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2019;125:2474-87</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients with Philadelphia positive ALL would be eligible for treatment with an alternate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The Subcommittee noted that median follow-up duration for patients who completed the study or were censored for overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range, 1.7-49.7 months). The Subcommittee noted that the most common standard of care received was FLAG chemotherapy (n=102) and that this was representative of what the New Zealand patient population with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL would receive.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of all patients with CR/CRi was higher for patients that received inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to standard of care (121 of 164 [73.8%] vs 50 of 143 [35.0%]), and that for patients achieving CR/CRi, the duration of remission was significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.91]; 1-sided P = 0.0071; median, 5.4 months [95% CI, 4.2-7.0 months] versus 4.2 months standard of care arm [95% CI, 2.7-5.7 months]). The Subcommittee also noted that the median progression free survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-5.8 months) compared to 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.1 months) in the standard of care treatment arm (HR, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34-0.60]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.0-9.2 months) compared to 6.2 months in the standard of care arm (95% CI, 4.7-8.3 months; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99; 1-sided P = 0.0105). The Subcommittee also noted that the 2-year survival was 22.8% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 16.7 to 29.6), compared to 10.0% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 5.7 to 15.5; P = 0.0004). The Subcommittee noted that three-year survival was 20.3% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 14.4 to 27.0) compared to 6.5% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 2.9 to 12.3; P = 0.0093).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that no difference in overall survival was observed in the Philadelphia-positive group, but when only Philadelphia-negative patients were considered, the HR for overall survival was 0.68 (97.5% CI, 0.51-0.92). The Subcommittee also noted that patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm had a lower rate of subsequent therapies (34.1%) than the standard of care arm (56.8%). The Subcommittee considered that, because subsequent treatments may have affected overall survival, sensitivity analyses which censored patients at the time of their first subsequent salvage therapy (eg blinatumomab, TKIs, CAR-T, or inotuzumab ozogamicin), had been performed, which may have preserved overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/ sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during or after treatment (including after post-HSCT follow-up) occurred in 14.0% of the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm and 2.1% in the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that more patients proceeded to HSCT at any time after study treatment in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm than the standard of care arm (79 of 164 vs 36 of 162; 1-sided P &lt; .0001), and that almost 4 times as many patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm proceeded to HSCT after achieving CR/CRi before the start of any follow-up induction therapy (65 of 164 [39.6%; 95% CI, 32.1%-47.6%] vs 17 of 162 [10.5%; 95% CI, 6.2%-16.3%]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median 2-year survival for inotuzumab ozogamicin patients who achieved CR/CRi was 12.6 months (95% CI 9.3 to 27.7) for those with follow-up HSCT and 7.1 months (95% CI 5.6 to 10.8) for those without follow-up HCST (HR 0.55; 97.5% CI 0.32 to 0.95; P = 0.0065).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that factors associated with improved overall survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm of the INO-VATE trial were best minimal residual disease (MRD) status, baseline platelet count, baseline haemoglobin level, duration of first remission, achieving CR/CRi, and whether a patient underwent HSCT during follow-up (all 2-sided P values &lt; .05).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subgroup analysis of the INO-VATE trial showed that CR/CRi outcomes were better in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group compared to standard of care for all age groups, as was MRD negativity (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29381191/"" target=""_blank"">Jabbour et al. Cancer. 2018;124:1722-32</a>). The Subcommittee also noted that the overall survival was better in patients aged under 55 years in both the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group and the standard of care group (&gt;55 years old: 8.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 7.0-11.1) vs 8.0 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.9-9.5); ≥55 years old: 5.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 4.8-8.0) vs 5.3 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.2-7.1).</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee noted patient reported outcomes from the INO-VATE trial assessed via self-administered European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Group 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508899/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2018;124:2151-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Overall health status measurements of global health status/QoL from the QLQ-C30, health state from the EQ-5D VAS, and the EQ-5D index scores all were numerically better among patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm, although without statistical significance. The Subcommittee also noted that individual functioning scores favoured inotuzumab ozogamicin (P&lt;0.05) in physical functioning (LSM difference, 6.9; 95% CI 1.4-12.3), role functioning (Least squares mean difference, 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-19.5) social functioning (LSM difference, 8.4; 95% CI 0.7-16.1). The Subcommittee noted that gastrointestinal symptoms such as appetite loss (LSM difference, -8.7; 95% CI 16.0 to -1.4; P &lt;0.05) were in favour of inotuzumab ozogamicin and exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 5.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant in relation to inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment for R/R B-cell positive ALL:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769965/"" target=""_blank"">De Angelo et al.

The Subcommittee noted that ALL can also spread to other organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. The Subcommittee noted that patients with B-Cell ALL typically present with symptoms related to anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to replacement of the bone marrow with tumour cells and that symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising/bleeding, and infections. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 17 incident patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL per year in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that equity as it pertains to socioeconomic status and ethnicity is not a relevant consideration for patients with B-cell ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that approximately 45% of adult patients with ALL experience disease relapse, with a further 4-11% demonstrated to be treatment refractory (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the primary goal from treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi). The Subcommittee noted that patients who achieve a CR/CRi may be eligible for allogenic HSCT, which may potentially be curative.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current standard first-line salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL is reintroduction of intensive chemotherapy treatment as part of an overall plan for long-term disease control to allow for an allografting procedure if eligible. The Subcommittee noted the intensive chemotherapy treatment includes the use of FLAG (Fludarabine, cytarabine [Ara-C] and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) with anthracycline (idarubicin), mitoxantrone with cytarabine, high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) based chemotherapy, and high-dose methotrexate in combination with pegylated-asparginase, vinca alkaloids, steroids, etoposide or alkylating agents. All of which require extended hospital stays for patients. The Subcommittee noted that currently available treatments for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell ALL are also limited by toxicity, associated with extended hospital stays and are associated with adverse events including haematotoxicity, infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, mucositis and neurotoxicity which can limit further treatment and dose intensity, and which may compromise patient outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that multiple studies have reported 5-year survival rates of less than 10% in adults with R/R ALL (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032921/"" target=""_blank"">Fielding et al. Blood. 2007;109:944-50</a>, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145276/"" target=""_blank"">Oriol et al. Haematologica. 2010;95:589-96</a>). The Subcommittee considered that only 5-30% of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL will be able to proceed to allogenic HSCT with currently funded treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are other treatments which are currently not funded in New Zealand that have been shown to be effective for this patient group, including blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager, and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) - T cell therapy, though the latter (eg. tisagenlecleucel) is currently restricted to the treatment of patients under 24 years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanised anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, which is a cytotoxic antibody agent. The Subcommittee noted that CD22 testing for the percentage of blasts with CD22 expression is currently routine for ALL patients, and that funding of inotuzumab ozogamicin would not create additional requirements for diagnostic testing. The Subcommittee noted that although CD22-positivity testing is widely used, receptor density of CD22 expression is not available in routine clinical practice and considered that this would not be necessary as response to inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed irrespective of receptor density of CD22 expression in the pivotal trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results from the phase III multicentre, global, open-label, randomised INOVATE trial in which patients ≥18 years old with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell -positive ALL and scheduled to receive first or second salvage treatment received either inotuzumab ozogamicin for up to six cycles (n=164) or standard of care (n=162) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30920645/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2019;125:2474-87</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients with Philadelphia positive ALL would be eligible for treatment with an alternate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The Subcommittee noted that median follow-up duration for patients who completed the study or were censored for overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range, 1.7-49.7 months). The Subcommittee noted that the most common standard of care received was FLAG chemotherapy (n=102) and that this was representative of what the New Zealand patient population with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL would receive.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of all patients with CR/CRi was higher for patients that received inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to standard of care (121 of 164 [73.8%] vs 50 of 143 [35.0%]), and that for patients achieving CR/CRi, the duration of remission was significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.91]; 1-sided P = 0.0071; median, 5.4 months [95% CI, 4.2-7.0 months] versus 4.2 months standard of care arm [95% CI, 2.7-5.7 months]). The Subcommittee also noted that the median progression free survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-5.8 months) compared to 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.1 months) in the standard of care treatment arm (HR, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34-0.60]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.0-9.2 months) compared to 6.2 months in the standard of care arm (95% CI, 4.7-8.3 months; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99; 1-sided P = 0.0105). The Subcommittee also noted that the 2-year survival was 22.8% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 16.7 to 29.6), compared to 10.0% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 5.7 to 15.5; P = 0.0004). The Subcommittee noted that three-year survival was 20.3% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm (95% CI 14.4 to 27.0) compared to 6.5% in the standard of care arm (95% CI 2.9 to 12.3; P = 0.0093).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that no difference in overall survival was observed in the Philadelphia-positive group, but when only Philadelphia-negative patients were considered, the HR for overall survival was 0.68 (97.5% CI, 0.51-0.92). The Subcommittee also noted that patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm had a lower rate of subsequent therapies (34.1%) than the standard of care arm (56.8%). The Subcommittee considered that, because subsequent treatments may have affected overall survival, sensitivity analyses which censored patients at the time of their first subsequent salvage therapy (eg blinatumomab, TKIs, CAR-T, or inotuzumab ozogamicin), had been performed, which may have preserved overall survival for the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/ sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during or after treatment (including after post-HSCT follow-up) occurred in 14.0% of the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm and 2.1% in the standard of care arm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that more patients proceeded to HSCT at any time after study treatment in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm than the standard of care arm (79 of 164 vs 36 of 162; 1-sided P &lt; .0001), and that almost 4 times as many patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm proceeded to HSCT after achieving CR/CRi before the start of any follow-up induction therapy (65 of 164 [39.6%; 95% CI, 32.1%-47.6%] vs 17 of 162 [10.5%; 95% CI, 6.2%-16.3%]; 1-sided P &lt; .0001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median 2-year survival for inotuzumab ozogamicin patients who achieved CR/CRi was 12.6 months (95% CI 9.3 to 27.7) for those with follow-up HSCT and 7.1 months (95% CI 5.6 to 10.8) for those without follow-up HCST (HR 0.55; 97.5% CI 0.32 to 0.95; P = 0.0065).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that factors associated with improved overall survival in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment arm of the INO-VATE trial were best minimal residual disease (MRD) status, baseline platelet count, baseline haemoglobin level, duration of first remission, achieving CR/CRi, and whether a patient underwent HSCT during follow-up (all 2-sided P values &lt; .05).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that subgroup analysis of the INO-VATE trial showed that CR/CRi outcomes were better in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group compared to standard of care for all age groups, as was MRD negativity (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29381191/"" target=""_blank"">Jabbour et al. Cancer. 2018;124:1722-32</a>). The Subcommittee also noted that the overall survival was better in patients aged under 55 years in both the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group and the standard of care group (&gt;55 years old: 8.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 7.0-11.1) vs 8.0 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.9-9.5); ≥55 years old: 5.6 months inotuzumab ozogamicin group (95% CI 4.8-8.0) vs 5.3 months standard of care group (95% CI 4.2-7.1).</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee noted patient reported outcomes from the INO-VATE trial assessed via self-administered European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Group 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508899/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Cancer. 2018;124:2151-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Overall health status measurements of global health status/QoL from the QLQ-C30, health state from the EQ-5D VAS, and the EQ-5D index scores all were numerically better among patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus the standard of care arm, although without statistical significance. The Subcommittee also noted that individual functioning scores favoured inotuzumab ozogamicin (P&lt;0.05) in physical functioning (LSM difference, 6.9; 95% CI 1.4-12.3), role functioning (Least squares mean difference, 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-19.5) social functioning (LSM difference, 8.4; 95% CI 0.7-16.1). The Subcommittee noted that gastrointestinal symptoms such as appetite loss (LSM difference, -8.7; 95% CI 16.0 to -1.4; P &lt;0.05) were in favour of inotuzumab ozogamicin and exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 5.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant in relation to inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment for R/R B-cell positive ALL:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769965/"" target=""_blank"">De Angelo et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the health benefits that would be experienced if inotuzumab ozogamicin were funded may be expected to be greater in New Zealand due to the current lack of access to alternative salvage therapies. The Subcommittee also considered that the ability to identify and treat toxicities related to inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment according to the INO-VATE trial is possible in current practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that progression free survival is a reasonable measure of expected benefit for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell positive ALL and is especially relevant to patients who are unable to progress to transplant. The Subcommittee considered that CR/CRi is crucial to the success of subsequent allogenic HSCT, and that the INO-VATE trial clearly showed an advantage in quickly reaching CR/CRi for patients that received inotuzumab ozogamicin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the Badar et al trial, which reported real-world outcomes from a multi-centre cohort analysis of patients who received treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32291234/"" target=""_blank"">Badar et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2020;20:556-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was a relatively small trial (n=84) which reported that the time to progression after induction with inotuzumab ozogamicin within one year was 36% of patients, which was lower than the 57% of patients reported in the INO-VATE trial. The Subcommittee considered that the proportion of patients that were Philadelphia chromosome positive in the Badar et al trial was greater than that of the INO-VATE trial may explain the variation in results between the two trials. The Subcommittee also noted that there were less instances of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in the Bader et al trial compared to the INO-VATE trial which was likely due to patients receiving prophylactic treatment for VOD in the Bader et al trial rather than treating VOD at onset. The Subcommittee also noted that the Bader et al. trial had relatively high incidence of matched donor transplants which are usually associated with lower rates of mortality than non-donor matched transplants, compared to both the New Zealand population and the INO-VATE trial population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc analysis of the INO-VATE trial seeking to assess the relationship between CD22 expression and treatment outcomes for inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard of care (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602684/"" target=""_blank"">Kantarjian et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2021;27:2742-54</a>). The Subcommittee noted that in patients with higher (≥90%) CD22 positivity, the rate of CR/CRi was 78.5% (95% CI 69.5% to 85.9%) for inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 35.5% (95% CI 25.8%–46.1%) for standard of care (rate difference 43%; 97.5% CI 28.8%–57.3%; one-sided P &lt; 0.0001). The Subcommittee also noted that in patients with lower (&lt;90%) CD22 positivity, CR/CRi rate of inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard of care was 65.7% (95% CI 47.8%–80.9%) versus 30.6% (95% CI 16.3%–48.1%; rate difference 35.2%; (97.5% CI, 10.3%–60%; one-sided P = 0.0015). The Subcommittee noted that within the inotuzumab ozogamicin treated group, the rate of CR (indicating a response with better quality of hematopoietic recovery than CRi) was 42.1% and 20% for patients with CD22 positivity ≥90% and &lt;90%, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the degree of CD22 positivity should not limit access to inotuzumab ozogamicin, as lower CD22-positivity remained sufficient to be able to induce response compared to standard of care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that inotuzumab ozogamicin offers significant benefits over currently funded treatments and that these include; high rates of complete response/complete haematological response, higher MRD negativity rates, longer progression free survival, longer overall survival, requires less transfusion support, decreases time spent in hospital, reduced need for second salvage therapy, and an increased likelihood of eligibility for allogenic HSCT.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also considered that the largest difference in cost to the health sector if inotuzumab ozogamicin were funded would be in the inpatient setting, as patients would spend considerably less time there compared to current standard of care. The Subcommittee considered that this would be expected to be similar to the differences observed for patients in the INO-VATE trial. The Subcommittee considered, however, that utilization of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this patient population may increase the demand on transplant services due to more patients achieving an adequate response and being able to progress to allogenic HSCT.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that while all patient subgroups showed benefit with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment, predictors of increased overall survival with inotuzumab were having the best MRD status, healthy baseline platelet count, high CD22 expression, longer duration of first remission, achieving complete response or complete haematologic response, low disease burden, and receiving follow-up allogenic HSCT.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
