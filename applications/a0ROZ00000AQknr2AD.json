At this time, the Subcommittee considered that the evidence available demonstrated that prucalopride provided a modest but clinically significant benefit for\u00a0</span>patients with severe chronic constipation and recommended that prucalopride be funded with a medium priority. The Committee reviewed these minutes in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2019</a> and considered that the population described by the proposed Special Authority criteria was potentially very large, and that the evidence reviewed suggested only a modest effect. The Committee considered the funding of prucalopride represented a significant fiscal risk and requested that the Committee have the opportunity to review the full application.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that prucalopride is a selective, high-affinity serotonin receptor agonist which facilitates cholinergic and excitatory noradrenergic, non-cholinergic neurotransmission resulting in the initiation of high amplitude propagated contractions in the colon, colonic propulsion, right colonic emptying, and gastric emptying via small bowel transit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that prucalopride is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives have failed to provide adequate relief.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that prucalopride is provided as a 1 mg or 2 mg film-coated tablet and is administered at a dose of 2 mg once daily for adults. The Committee noted that prucalopride is not recommended for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are three major subtypes of chronic idiopathic constipation: normal transit (functional constipation), rectal evacuation disorders, and slow transit constipation. The Committee noted that slow transit constipation is the least prevalent subtype.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available regarding the prevalence of slow-transit constipation in New Zealand. The Committee considered a meta-analysis which identified a pooled prevalence of chronic idiopathic constipation of 14% (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606976\" target=\"_blank\">Suares &amp; Ford. Am J Gastroenterol. 2011;106:1582-91</a>), and a retrospective cohort study which identified a prevalence of slow-transit constipation of 4.3% among patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180057\" target=\"_blank\">Nullens et al. Gut. 2012;61:1132-9</a>). The Committee considered that if these data are applicable to the New Zealand population, there may be as many as 30,000 individuals with chronic idiopathic constipation due to slow-transit constipation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the gold-standard method for assessing colonic transit is the radio-opaque marker test. The Committee noted that there is variable access to colonic transit testing within New Zealand, and that slow-transit constipation is more often diagnosed using a combination of clinical observation, x-ray imaging, and familial history.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the initial management strategy for symptomatic constipation is dietary modification, including fibre and fluid supplementation. The Committee noted that if this approach is inadequate, patients receive osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol and lactulose, with stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl used as a second-line treatment if osmotic laxatives do not adequately address the condition.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two meta-analyses which investigated the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205879\" target=\"_blank\">Ford et al. Gut. 2011;60:209-18</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27287486\" target=\"_blank\">Nelson et al. Gut. 2017;66:1611-22</a>). The Committee noted that Ford et al. (2011) concluded that prucalopride was superior to placebo for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation. The Committee noted that Nelson et al. (2017) reported no difference in primary endpoints for bisacodyl, sodium picosulphate, prucalopride, and velusetrag, but noted bisacodyl was superior in change from baseline in spontaneous bowel movements per week.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Committee noted a systematic review which evaluated the cost effectiveness of treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352437\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Han et al.

Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2013;37:876-86</a>). The Committee noted that the study concluded that macrogol/PEG 3350 plus electrolytes was at least as effective and generally better tolerated than prucalopride for the treatment of chronic constipation. The Committee considered that while this is an example of an active-controlled trial, that there were limitations that prevent its generalizability, including that it was a single-centre Eastern European study conducted in a controlled environment, with a large proportion of participants with an evacuation disorder at baseline, and a non-FDA endorsed primary endpoint.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that prucalopride would be used in conjunction with other agents such as conventional laxatives, and that funding prucalopride would be unlikely to reduce the use of other laxatives.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the use of prucalopride has the potential to reduce longer-term complications of chronic constipation which can require surgical intervention, but that they did not review any evidence that supported this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there are a group of children and adolescents with dysmotility syndromes who could potentially benefit from treatment with prucalopride but noted that no evidence was considered for this population, and that this group is outside the Medsafe approved indication. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that individuals facing significant procedures such as intestinal transplant could still be considered via PHARMAC\u2019s Exceptional Circumstances Framework.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Gastroenterology services in New Zealand are overextended, and that it would be difficult to get an appointment with a gastroenterologist for chronic constipation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Rome IV criteria for functional chronic constipation is adequate for defining the population with chronic idiopathic constipation but is not sufficient to identify patients with slow-transit constipation. The Committee considered that any restrictions on access to prucalopride would need to be specific to patients with slow-transit constipation who are refractory to regular laxatives.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is a high health need for patients with chronic slow-transit constipation for whom conventional laxatives have been inadequate but considered that the evidence provided by the applicant did not reflect this population. \u00a0The Committee considered that the application should be referred back to the Gastroenterology Subcommittee regarding how to define the population with the highest health need and those most likely to benefit, and the evidence for the use of prucalopride in this population.\u00a0</p>",

The Advisory Committee noted that PTAC considered that requiring a gastroenterologist be involved in the Special Authority was a considerable access barrier given the common nature of the condition and the limited number of gastroenterologists. </p><h3><em>Health Need\u00a0</em></h3><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted the comments previously made by the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee and PTAC regarding the significant health need of individuals with treatment refractory slow-transit constipation.

The Advisory Committee considered that there was good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials that prucalopride provided a modest, but clinically significant, benefit over placebo in terms of constipation relief. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that prucalopride is a selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist approved by Medsafe for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives have failed to provide adequate relief. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that PTAC had concerns however, regarding the evidence of benefit in the targeted group, noting the absence of head-to-head trials comparing prucalopride with other laxatives for the treatment of slow-transit constipation. The Advisory Committee considered that it was unlikely that there would be any emerging clinical trial evidence directly comparing the respective laxative agents and considered that indirect evidence was likely the best available data to guide decision making. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of laxative treatments in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipations, that all agents were effective at inducing spontaneous complete bowel motions compared with placebo and that there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between agents (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27287486/\" target=\"_blank\">Nelson et al.

While Members considered that requiring gastroenterologist involvement could mean a barrier to access due to lack of capacity, they considered that it was important to prevent misdiagnosis and it was an important way to limit use outside the intended population. The Committee considered that it wasn\u2019t possible to describe clinical circumstances, for diagnosing slow-transit constipation in funding criteria, that would avoid the need for a gastroenterologist. The Committee considered that the majority of individuals who appear to have slow-transit constipation have anismus (outlet obstruction) and require biofeedback as the main intervention. The Committee considered it was important to ensure that treatment with prucalopride was targeted to those individuals who have had anismus excluded. The Advisory Committee considered that the other criteria remained appropriate in this context. \u00a0</p><h3><em>Suitability</em> </h3><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that prucalopride is a single tablet taken once daily and that this may make it more suitable for some patients than other treatments.</p><h3><em>Costs and Savings </em></h3><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that prucalopride would be used alongside other laxative agents and would constitute additional pharmaceutical expenditure. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted a cost-effectiveness analysis on prucalopride for the treatment of chronic constipation conducted in the Netherlands (<u style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 204);\">Nuijten MJ, Dubois DJ, Joseph A, Annemans L. Cost-effectiveness of prucalopride in the treatment of chronic constipation in the Netherlands. Front Pharmacol. 2015 Apr 14;6:67</u>).
