The Subcommittee noted that tenofovir alafenamide is not currently available in New Zealand; however, there are already tenofovir disoproxil-free treatments available for the small number of patients with tenofovir disoproxil associated renal toxicity. The Subcommittee noted that tenofovir alafenamide would be of benefit for patients with chronic hepatitis B with tenofovir disoproxil associated renal toxicity and that it could be of benefit for patients with proven osteoporosis who have limited treatment options with other standard antiretrovirals.</p><p><br></p><p>5.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the following trials:</p><p>5.6.1\u00a0<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28867499/\" target=\"_blank\">Sax et al.

The Committee noted that the trial patients taking tenofovir alafenamide had a high chance of developing obesity, and that this population would be comparable to the New Zealand patient population. The Subcommittee considered that tenofovir alafenamide with an integrase inhibitor may result in significant rates of obesity and associated metabolic complications but noted that there is currently no peer-reviewed, published data to demonstrate this. The Subcommittee noted that the metabolic effects of tenofovir alafenamide also included an increase in high density lipoproteins across all studies and considered this to be concerning considering the long-term effects of this are unknown.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the evidence provided was of high quality, although lacking in long-term follow-up. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence showed that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide has potent antiviral activity and that it is non-inferior to currently available HIV antiretroviral treatments. The Subcommittee also noted that, compared to tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide results in a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir exposure, thus reducing renal and bone exposure and toxicity.

The Subcommittee noted that bothersome symptoms (ie fatigue, dizziness/light-headedness, nausea/vomiting, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, headaches, bloating/pain/gas, and changes in body composition) were reported by less patients who received bictegravir than those who received dolutegravir, and that four of the seven authors are employed by Gilead Sciences.</p><p><br></p><p>5.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted preliminary unpublished evidence presented at the European AIDS Clinical Society Conference in 2019, comparing tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/dolutegravir, tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/dolutegravir and tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/efavirenz. The Committee noted that the trial patients taking tenofovir alafenamide had a high chance of developing obesity, and that this population would be comparable to the New Zealand patient population. The Subcommittee considered that tenofovir alafenamide with an integrase inhibitor may result in significant rates of obesity and associated metabolic complications but noted that there is currently no peer-reviewed, published data to demonstrate this. The Subcommittee noted that the metabolic effects of tenofovir alafenamide also included an increase in high density lipoproteins across all studies and considered this to be concerning considering the long-term effects of this are unknown.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the evidence provided was of high quality, although lacking in long-term follow-up. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence showed that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide has potent antiviral activity and that it is non-inferior to currently available HIV antiretroviral treatments. The Subcommittee also noted that, compared to tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide results in a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir exposure, thus reducing renal and bone exposure and toxicity. The Subcommittee considered that bictegravir is as good as dolutegravir, which is most commonly prescribed in the first line treatment of HIV in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>5.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide were to be funded, it would be preferred over boosted protease inhibitor-based regimens, dolutegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine, and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil.</p><p><br></p><p>5.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the combination of a single tablet regimen, a small tablet size, and tenofovir alafenamide availability will make bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide an attractive option for patients and health professionals. The Subcommittee considered that, if it were to be funded, there would be 50 to 75% uptake in the first 12-24 months, from the total HIV patient population in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that there may be an even greater uptake in patients currently on a boosted protease-inhibitor regimen, who would only have to take one tablet a day with Biktarvy as opposed to four or five tablets on their current multiple-tablet regimen. The Subcommittee noted that single tablet regimens have rapidly taken over the market share in Australia.</p><p><br></p><p>5.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that most HIV patients are on a once daily dosing and considered that the number of tablets does not have an effect on compliance. The Subcommittee considered that the option of a single-tablet regimen would not have a noticeable impact on treatment adherence, as most HIV patients already have well controlled viral suppression.</p><p><br></p><p>5.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that most other antiretroviral HIV treatments may be significantly cheaper than bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, and that it is highly likely that many patients currently taking these treatments would switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should it become available, on the basis of patient preference for a single-tablet regimen, and the perceived benefit of taking the most recently available treatment. The Subcommittee considered that as this would incur a significant cost to the health system, it would be feasible to fund bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide only if it was cost-neutral to the weighted cost of all other antiretroviral HIV treatments. The Subcommittee also considered that future price reductions of comparator drugs as they come off patent should be taken into account when considering health system costs and savings.</p><p><br></p><p>5.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in the supplier\u2019s cost minimisation model, they had reduced monitoring costs for bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide compared to other drugs. The Committee considered it unlikely that monitoring costs would be reduced as patients would have to undergo all the same tests with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as with other antiretrovirals.</p>",
