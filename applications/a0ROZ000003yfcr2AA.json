          "s": "<p>Multiple myeloma</p><p>8.8.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 400 incident cases of myeloma in New Zealand each year and that this was increasing. The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p>8.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1st line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (Blacklock et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19:10,sE213).</p><p>8.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that transplant eligibility was usually considered based on physiological fitness and that transplants are usually received by people under the age of 70. The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p>8.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>8.11.1.1.\tthe lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>8.11.1.2.\tthe inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>8.11.1.3.\taccess to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p>8.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. B J Haem. 2018;182:513-20).\u00a0</p><p>8.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that approximately 10-20% of patients currently do not respond to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) and that this estimate would be relevant to both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p>8.14.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p>8.15.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>8.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens.\u00a0</p><p>8.18.\tThe Subcommittee considered that in the 2nd line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line.\u00a0</p><p>8.19.\tThe Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients. Lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients</p><p>8.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in 2018 it was difficult to compare the health benefits and risks of lenalidomide and bortezomib containing regimens, but it was reasonable to consider at that stage that they had the same or similar benefits (CaTSoP April 2018).</p><p>8.34.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were no comparative trials between RVD and RD and the standard of care treatment for this population. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of lenalidomide could be reasonably extrapolated from the indirect evidence available.</p><p>8.35.\tThe Subcommittee noted the final analysis of the phase 3 FIRST trial of upfront treatment for multiple myeloma (Facon et al. 2018;131:301-10). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 1623 patients, randomised to receive RD continuously, RD for 18 cycles or MPT for 72 weeks. The Subcommittee noted that PFS was significantly longer with RD continuous vs. MPT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.79; P &lt; .00001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median OS was 10 months longer with RD continuous vs MPT (59.1 vs 49.1 months; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92; P = .0023). The Subcommittee noted that there was a similar PFS benefit for RD continuous compared with RD for 18 cycles, however that there was no OS benefit for RD continuous vs RD for 18 cycles. The Subcommittee noted that continuous RD was associated with fewer haematologic and neurologic adverse effects, a moderate increase in infections and fewer second primary haematologic cancers compared with MPT. The Subcommittee considered that this highlighted a potential discrepancy with the with increased risk of second primary malignancy reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. 2018).</p><p>8.36.\tThe Subcommittee noted a network meta-analysis indirect comparison of first line treatments for newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients (Gil-Sierra et al. Eur J. Haematol. 2020;105(1):56-65). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RVD compared to CTD (0.454; 95% Credibility Intervals (CrI) 0.23, 0.891) and MPT (0.511; 95% CrI 0.384, 0.682), with a numerically better difference than BMP (0.775; 95% CrI 0.43, 1.402). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RD compared to MPT (0.719; 95% CrI 0.612, 0.849), however the difference was not numerically better than CTD (0.639; 95% CrI 0.34, 1.199), and was numerically worse than that of BMP (1.091; 95% CrI 0.638, 1.887). The Subcommittee reiterated the inherent limitations of such indirect comparison methods.</p><p>8.37.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of the randomised, phase 3 trial (SWOG S0777) comparing RVD and RD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, without an intent for immediate transplant (Durie et al. Blood Cancer J. 2020;10:53). The Subcommittee noted that 43% of the 525 patients included in the trial were aged 65 years and over and 69% of all patients were intended for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to evaluate the OS and PFS of RVD and RD in the transplant ineligible patient population was from this trial. However, the Subcommittee considered that although similar, this trial included a younger, fitter population than the average New Zealand transplant ineligible population.</p><p>8.37.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the median PFS for RVD in SWOG S0777 was greater than that of RD (41 months vs 29 months; p=0.003). The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for RVD was greater than that of RD (NR vs. 69 months; p=0.0114) and that when adjusting for age, RVD was better than RD for both PFS and OS. The Subcommittee noted that the subgroup and multivariate analyses reported that all age groups randomised to RVD had greater PFS and OS. However, in patients aged less than 65 years, the differences were statistically significant for PFS only, and the OS difference was only statistically significant in patients aged greater than 75 years. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients with grade 3 toxicity and those who discontinued treatment because of toxicity was greater for those patients who received RVD than RD.</p><p>8.38.\tThe Subcommittee noted a phase 2 trial of modified lenalidomide in combination with VD (RVD-lite) in transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma (O\u2019Donnell et al. Br J Haematol. 2018;182:222-30; O\u2019Donnell et al. Blood 2019;134 (Supplement_1):3178). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 53 patients with a median age of 72 years and that patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly. After a median follow up of 61 months the median PFS was 41.9 months and the OS was not reached (5 year OS of 61.3%). The Subcommittee considered that given the reported 5 year OS in New Zealand (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019), there may be a benefit of this regimen compared to the current status quo for patients in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted the concern regarding the requirement for twice weekly bortezomib, and considered that although this trial was not randomised the results regarding this regimen are promising.</p><p>8.39.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if funded, this would result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, as per the SWOG S0777 trial protocol, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib.\u00a0</p><p>8.40.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, the uptake of RVD or RVD-LITE would be high and be used in approximately 75% of patients with transplant ineligible multiple myeloma compared with RD.</p><p>8.41.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be important to specify the maximum number of cycles of RVD for transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that there was data to support varying cycle numbers, and therefore it was not appropriate to limit the cycle numbers for lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that RVD-LITE had not been trialled against RD in this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that clinicians may elect between the use of the RVD-LITE and full dose RVD regimen depending on patient performance status.\u00a0</p><p>8.42.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of a randomised phase 3 trial that investigated the efficacy of RD followed by maintenance 10 mg/day without dexamethasone (RD-R) (Larocca et al. Blood. blood.2020009507). The Subcommittee noted that the event free survival (EFS) was 10.4 with RD-R vs. 6.9 months with continuous RD (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.95, p=0.02). Median PFS was 20.2 vs 18.3 months (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55-1.10, p=0.16), 3-year OS was 74% vs 63% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-1.03, p=0.06). The Subcommittee considered that on this basis, it would be possible that a proportion of patients would cease treatment with dexamethasone after 9 cycles and receive a lower maintenance dose of lenalidomide. The Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to estimate the uptake of this therapy, but that it would be driven by a combination of patient fitness and disease risk.</p><p>8.43.\tThe Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). These guidelines indicate that optimal treatment includes the combination of a corticosteroid in combination with either an immunomodulatory drug or a proteasome inhibitor. The Subcommittee considered that in the future, there may be a desire to use one of the novel proteasome inhibitors.</p><p>8.44.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it remains difficult to compare bortezomib based regimens with RD in transplant ineligible patients. However, the Subcommittee considered that there was a benefit of providing an option of an entirely oral regimen (RD) compared to the weekly SC injection. The Subcommittee considered that this would reduce the burden for patients, who require multiple visits to the day stay to receive the current standard of care. The Subcommittee considered that the added convenience and suitability of this as an option would be particularly beneficial.</p><p>8.45.\tThe Subcommittee considered that for patients receiving RD, it would be important to factor in the cost of continuous therapy vs. the current standard of care, which is administered for a fixed duration. However, the Subcommittee noted that there would be a significant reduction in the infusion costs and treatment visits for patients compared with the current standard of care.</p><p>8.46.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be necessary to allow sufficient flexibility for patients receiving RD to reduce the dose of lenalidomide and stop dexamethasone if deemed necessary by the treating clinician.</p><p>8.47.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if RD were funded in this setting, this may provide an indirect benefit of delaying treatment with bortezomib, resulting in the patient being exposed to bortezomib for the first time in a later line of therapy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
          "fs": "<p>Multiple myeloma</p><p>8.8.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 400 incident cases of myeloma in New Zealand each year and that this was increasing. The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p>8.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1st line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (Blacklock et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19:10,sE213).</p><p>8.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that transplant eligibility was usually considered based on physiological fitness and that transplants are usually received by people under the age of 70. The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p>8.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>8.11.1.1.\tthe lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>8.11.1.2.\tthe inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>8.11.1.3.\taccess to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p>8.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. B J Haem. 2018;182:513-20).\u00a0</p><p>8.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that approximately 10-20% of patients currently do not respond to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) and that this estimate would be relevant to both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p>8.14.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p>8.15.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>8.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens.\u00a0</p><p>8.18.\tThe Subcommittee considered that in the 2nd line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line.\u00a0</p><p>8.19.\tThe Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients. Lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients</p><p>8.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in 2018 it was difficult to compare the health benefits and risks of lenalidomide and bortezomib containing regimens, but it was reasonable to consider at that stage that they had the same or similar benefits (CaTSoP April 2018).</p><p>8.34.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were no comparative trials between RVD and RD and the standard of care treatment for this population. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of lenalidomide could be reasonably extrapolated from the indirect evidence available.</p><p>8.35.\tThe Subcommittee noted the final analysis of the phase 3 FIRST trial of upfront treatment for multiple myeloma (Facon et al. 2018;131:301-10). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 1623 patients, randomised to receive RD continuously, RD for 18 cycles or MPT for 72 weeks. The Subcommittee noted that PFS was significantly longer with RD continuous vs. MPT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.79; P &lt; .00001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median OS was 10 months longer with RD continuous vs MPT (59.1 vs 49.1 months; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92; P = .0023). The Subcommittee noted that there was a similar PFS benefit for RD continuous compared with RD for 18 cycles, however that there was no OS benefit for RD continuous vs RD for 18 cycles. The Subcommittee noted that continuous RD was associated with fewer haematologic and neurologic adverse effects, a moderate increase in infections and fewer second primary haematologic cancers compared with MPT. The Subcommittee considered that this highlighted a potential discrepancy with the with increased risk of second primary malignancy reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. 2018).</p><p>8.36.\tThe Subcommittee noted a network meta-analysis indirect comparison of first line treatments for newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients (Gil-Sierra et al. Eur J. Haematol. 2020;105(1):56-65). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RVD compared to CTD (0.454; 95% Credibility Intervals (CrI) 0.23, 0.891) and MPT (0.511; 95% CrI 0.384, 0.682), with a numerically better difference than BMP (0.775; 95% CrI 0.43, 1.402). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RD compared to MPT (0.719; 95% CrI 0.612, 0.849), however the difference was not numerically better than CTD (0.639; 95% CrI 0.34, 1.199), and was numerically worse than that of BMP (1.091; 95% CrI 0.638, 1.887). The Subcommittee reiterated the inherent limitations of such indirect comparison methods.</p><p>8.37.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of the randomised, phase 3 trial (SWOG S0777) comparing RVD and RD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, without an intent for immediate transplant (Durie et al. Blood Cancer J. 2020;10:53). The Subcommittee noted that 43% of the 525 patients included in the trial were aged 65 years and over and 69% of all patients were intended for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to evaluate the OS and PFS of RVD and RD in the transplant ineligible patient population was from this trial. However, the Subcommittee considered that although similar, this trial included a younger, fitter population than the average New Zealand transplant ineligible population.</p><p>8.37.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the median PFS for RVD in SWOG S0777 was greater than that of RD (41 months vs 29 months; p=0.003). The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for RVD was greater than that of RD (NR vs. 69 months; p=0.0114) and that when adjusting for age, RVD was better than RD for both PFS and OS. The Subcommittee noted that the subgroup and multivariate analyses reported that all age groups randomised to RVD had greater PFS and OS. However, in patients aged less than 65 years, the differences were statistically significant for PFS only, and the OS difference was only statistically significant in patients aged greater than 75 years. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients with grade 3 toxicity and those who discontinued treatment because of toxicity was greater for those patients who received RVD than RD.</p><p>8.38.\tThe Subcommittee noted a phase 2 trial of modified lenalidomide in combination with VD (RVD-lite) in transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma (O\u2019Donnell et al. Br J Haematol. 2018;182:222-30; O\u2019Donnell et al. Blood 2019;134 (Supplement_1):3178). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 53 patients with a median age of 72 years and that patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly. After a median follow up of 61 months the median PFS was 41.9 months and the OS was not reached (5 year OS of 61.3%). The Subcommittee considered that given the reported 5 year OS in New Zealand (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019), there may be a benefit of this regimen compared to the current status quo for patients in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted the concern regarding the requirement for twice weekly bortezomib, and considered that although this trial was not randomised the results regarding this regimen are promising.</p><p>8.39.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if funded, this would result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, as per the SWOG S0777 trial protocol, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib.\u00a0</p><p>8.40.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, the uptake of RVD or RVD-LITE would be high and be used in approximately 75% of patients with transplant ineligible multiple myeloma compared with RD.</p><p>8.41.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be important to specify the maximum number of cycles of RVD for transplant ineligible patients.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>Multiple myeloma</p><p>8.8.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were approximately 400 incident cases of myeloma in New Zealand each year and that this was increasing. The Subcommittee considered that the incidence was greater in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Subcommittee noted that the median age for people with myeloma in New Zealand was approximately 70 years old and that this was lower for M\u0101ori and Pacific people (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the five year overall survival (OS) of a patient with myeloma was approximately 45%, with a median OS of 51.2 months (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019). The Subcommittee noted that the OS of M\u0101ori and Pacific people was poorer, but that cause-specific survival did not differ between populations. The Subcommittee considered that M\u0101ori and Pacific people were less likely to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</p><p>8.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted a recent registry study from the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma registry, which indicated that M\u0101ori and Pacific people presented with myeloma at younger age, were more likely to present with comorbidities, were more likely to present with an adverse karyotype, were less likely to commence 1st line therapy, and after adjusting for age their OS was less than other populations\u2019 (Blacklock et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2019;19:10,sE213).</p><p>8.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that transplant eligibility was usually considered based on physiological fitness and that transplants are usually received by people under the age of 70. The Subcommittee considered that around half of all patients who present with myeloma would be eligible for transplant. However, the Subcommittee noted that the exact numbers of transplants could be obtained from the Australasian Bone Marrow Registry.</p><p>8.11.\tThe Subcommittee noted correspondence from the New Zealand Myeloma Interest Group (NZMIG), which highlighted specific concerns regarding:</p><p>8.11.1.1.\tthe lack of treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting, in particular, those patients who progress on lenalidomide maintenance therapy;</p><p>8.11.1.2.\tthe inequality in treatment access in the first line, given the requirement for regular day stay visits, presenting a barrier to treatment for many patients</p><p>8.11.1.3.\taccess to lenalidomide in both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients.</p><p>8.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted the potential toxicities of treatment with lenalidomide, principally, neutropoenia, infection and fatigue. The Subcommittee also noted the potential concern regarding an increase in second primary cancers associated with lenalidomide in combination with alkylators reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. B J Haem. 2018;182:513-20).\u00a0</p><p>8.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that approximately 10-20% of patients currently do not respond to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) and that this estimate would be relevant to both transplant eligible and transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 5% of transplant-ineligible patients would not be fit enough to receive a bortezomib containing regimen. The Subcommittee noted that the need to travel may also impact the use of bortezomib in this setting.</p><p>8.14.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for the treatment of either transplant eligible or transplant ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, it would be unlikely that first exposure to bortezomib would be reserved until a later line of therapy for most patients. The Subcommittee considered that the first remission is likely to be the most durable, and therefore reserving the first use of bortezomib until a later line of therapy would not occur unless the patient\u2019s circumstances were such that treatment with bortezomib posed significant difficulty or risk. The Subcommittee considered that if a patient progressed on a regimen in first line, clinicians would be likely to treat the patients with a different treatment in second line in order to offer the benefits of a different active agent.</p><p>8.15.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to dictate or know exactly how lenalidomide would be used if it were funded for the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, however that it would be appropriate to impose some limitations on its usage to manage the fiscal risk regarding the use of lenalidomide for newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>8.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant eligible patients are treated with induction therapy, which consists of 4-6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or 4-6 cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD). The Subcommittee noted that post ASCT, these patients would be eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD and that this would be an appropriate comparator for new agents proposed for funding in this patient group.\u00a0</p><p>8.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted that currently transplant ineligible patients are treated with up to 9 cycles of a bortezomib based regimen (CyBorD, BTD or BMP) or thalidomide based regimens (CTD or MPT). The Subcommittee considered that most patients would be treated with CyBorD, however that there may be a group of patients who are treated with one of the thalidomide based regimens.\u00a0</p><p>8.18.\tThe Subcommittee considered that in the 2nd line setting patients would receive an alternative regimen to what was received in first line and that it would likely include bortezomib, unless not suitable or tolerated. The Subcommittee considered that these treatment options were suboptimal and noted the current applications for carfilzomib and daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma for patients who had not previously received a transplant. The Subcommittee noted that only patients who had not had lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT would be eligible for lenalidomide in third line.\u00a0</p><p>8.19.\tThe Subcommittee noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation test (FISH) is usually used to stratify transplant eligible patients based on risk status. The Subcommittee considered that if lenalidomide were funded for transplant ineligible patients, it might be used increasingly as a risk stratification method to aid with clinical decision making regarding the most appropriate treatment regimens for patients. Lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients</p><p>8.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in 2018 it was difficult to compare the health benefits and risks of lenalidomide and bortezomib containing regimens, but it was reasonable to consider at that stage that they had the same or similar benefits (CaTSoP April 2018).</p><p>8.34.\tThe Subcommittee noted that there were no comparative trials between RVD and RD and the standard of care treatment for this population. However, the Subcommittee considered that the benefit of lenalidomide could be reasonably extrapolated from the indirect evidence available.</p><p>8.35.\tThe Subcommittee noted the final analysis of the phase 3 FIRST trial of upfront treatment for multiple myeloma (Facon et al. 2018;131:301-10). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 1623 patients, randomised to receive RD continuously, RD for 18 cycles or MPT for 72 weeks. The Subcommittee noted that PFS was significantly longer with RD continuous vs. MPT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.79; P &lt; .00001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median OS was 10 months longer with RD continuous vs MPT (59.1 vs 49.1 months; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92; P = .0023). The Subcommittee noted that there was a similar PFS benefit for RD continuous compared with RD for 18 cycles, however that there was no OS benefit for RD continuous vs RD for 18 cycles. The Subcommittee noted that continuous RD was associated with fewer haematologic and neurologic adverse effects, a moderate increase in infections and fewer second primary haematologic cancers compared with MPT. The Subcommittee considered that this highlighted a potential discrepancy with the with increased risk of second primary malignancy reported from surveillance of patient registry data (Costa et al. 2018).</p><p>8.36.\tThe Subcommittee noted a network meta-analysis indirect comparison of first line treatments for newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients (Gil-Sierra et al. Eur J. Haematol. 2020;105(1):56-65). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RVD compared to CTD (0.454; 95% Credibility Intervals (CrI) 0.23, 0.891) and MPT (0.511; 95% CrI 0.384, 0.682), with a numerically better difference than BMP (0.775; 95% CrI 0.43, 1.402). The Subcommittee noted that the hazard ratio in PFS was statistically significantly better for RD compared to MPT (0.719; 95% CrI 0.612, 0.849), however the difference was not numerically better than CTD (0.639; 95% CrI 0.34, 1.199), and was numerically worse than that of BMP (1.091; 95% CrI 0.638, 1.887). The Subcommittee reiterated the inherent limitations of such indirect comparison methods.</p><p>8.37.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of the randomised, phase 3 trial (SWOG S0777) comparing RVD and RD in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, without an intent for immediate transplant (Durie et al. Blood Cancer J. 2020;10:53). The Subcommittee noted that 43% of the 525 patients included in the trial were aged 65 years and over and 69% of all patients were intended for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that the most appropriate evidence to evaluate the OS and PFS of RVD and RD in the transplant ineligible patient population was from this trial. However, the Subcommittee considered that although similar, this trial included a younger, fitter population than the average New Zealand transplant ineligible population.</p><p>8.37.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the median PFS for RVD in SWOG S0777 was greater than that of RD (41 months vs 29 months; p=0.003). The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for RVD was greater than that of RD (NR vs. 69 months; p=0.0114) and that when adjusting for age, RVD was better than RD for both PFS and OS. The Subcommittee noted that the subgroup and multivariate analyses reported that all age groups randomised to RVD had greater PFS and OS. However, in patients aged less than 65 years, the differences were statistically significant for PFS only, and the OS difference was only statistically significant in patients aged greater than 75 years. The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of patients with grade 3 toxicity and those who discontinued treatment because of toxicity was greater for those patients who received RVD than RD.</p><p>8.38.\tThe Subcommittee noted a phase 2 trial of modified lenalidomide in combination with VD (RVD-lite) in transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma (O\u2019Donnell et al. Br J Haematol. 2018;182:222-30; O\u2019Donnell et al. Blood 2019;134 (Supplement_1):3178). The Subcommittee noted that this trial included 53 patients with a median age of 72 years and that patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly. After a median follow up of 61 months the median PFS was 41.9 months and the OS was not reached (5 year OS of 61.3%). The Subcommittee considered that given the reported 5 year OS in New Zealand (The Burden of Multiple Myeloma in New Zealand July 2019), there may be a benefit of this regimen compared to the current status quo for patients in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted the concern regarding the requirement for twice weekly bortezomib, and considered that although this trial was not randomised the results regarding this regimen are promising.</p><p>8.39.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if funded, this would result in a slight increase in the need to manage infections in patients receiving RVD, as per the SWOG S0777 trial protocol, but that there would be no changes to the pharmacy, nursing, day stay requirement if funded, as such requirements primarily relate to the administration of bortezomib.\u00a0</p><p>8.40.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if lenalidomide were funded for newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients, the uptake of RVD or RVD-LITE would be high and be used in approximately 75% of patients with transplant ineligible multiple myeloma compared with RD.</p><p>8.41.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be important to specify the maximum number of cycles of RVD for transplant ineligible patients. The Subcommittee considered that there was data to support varying cycle numbers, and therefore it was not appropriate to limit the cycle numbers for lenalidomide in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that RVD-LITE had not been trialled against RD in this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that clinicians may elect between the use of the RVD-LITE and full dose RVD regimen depending on patient performance status.\u00a0</p><p>8.42.\tThe Subcommittee noted the results of a randomised phase 3 trial that investigated the efficacy of RD followed by maintenance 10 mg/day without dexamethasone (RD-R) (Larocca et al. Blood. blood.2020009507). The Subcommittee noted that the event free survival (EFS) was 10.4 with RD-R vs. 6.9 months with continuous RD (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.95, p=0.02). Median PFS was 20.2 vs 18.3 months (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55-1.10, p=0.16), 3-year OS was 74% vs 63% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-1.03, p=0.06). The Subcommittee considered that on this basis, it would be possible that a proportion of patients would cease treatment with dexamethasone after 9 cycles and receive a lower maintenance dose of lenalidomide. The Subcommittee considered that it would be difficult to estimate the uptake of this therapy, but that it would be driven by a combination of patient fitness and disease risk.</p><p>8.43.\tThe Subcommittee noted the joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario (Mickael et al. J Clin Oncol.2019;37:1228-63). These guidelines indicate that optimal treatment includes the combination of a corticosteroid in combination with either an immunomodulatory drug or a proteasome inhibitor. The Subcommittee considered that in the future, there may be a desire to use one of the novel proteasome inhibitors.</p><p>8.44.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it remains difficult to compare bortezomib based regimens with RD in transplant ineligible patients. However, the Subcommittee considered that there was a benefit of providing an option of an entirely oral regimen (RD) compared to the weekly SC injection. The Subcommittee considered that this would reduce the burden for patients, who require multiple visits to the day stay to receive the current standard of care. The Subcommittee considered that the added convenience and suitability of this as an option would be particularly beneficial.</p><p>8.45.\tThe Subcommittee considered that for patients receiving RD, it would be important to factor in the cost of continuous therapy vs. the current standard of care, which is administered for a fixed duration. However, the Subcommittee noted that there would be a significant reduction in the infusion costs and treatment visits for patients compared with the current standard of care.</p><p>8.46.\tThe Subcommittee considered that it would be necessary to allow sufficient flexibility for patients receiving RD to reduce the dose of lenalidomide and stop dexamethasone if deemed necessary by the treating clinician.</p><p>8.47.\tThe Subcommittee considered that if RD were funded in this setting, this may provide an indirect benefit of delaying treatment with bortezomib, resulting in the patient being exposed to bortezomib for the first time in a later line of therapy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
