The Committee noted that a study from Lakes DHB in 2022 reported that there had been an 8-fold increase in IBD diagnoses in Māori between the 2011–2015 and 2016–2020 periods, though incidence remains significantly lower than that of non-Māori (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35728240/"" target=""_blank"">Qiu et al.

The Committee also considered that an oral option is likely to increase treatment adherence and acceptability.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Need</em></h3><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the health needs of people with ulcerative colitis (UC) are high, and that impacts of treatment failure or UC flares are significant for those affected and can be socially isolating and affect relationships and the ability to work. The Committee noted that according to the American College of Gastroenterology moderate to severe UC is defined by patients: usually having six or more stools per day, frequently experiencing blood in their stool, often feeling bowel urgency, having a lower haemoglobin than normal, and Mayo endoscopy scores of two to three (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840605/"" target=""_blank"">Rubin et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2019;114:384-413</a>). </p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that disease activity refers to a cross-sectional assessment of inflammatory impact on an individual’s symptoms, endoscopy findings, histology, and biomarkers at a point in time, whereas severity refers to the longitudinal and historical factors that provide a complete picture of the overall disease burden since the patient’s diagnosis. The Committee noted that many factors contribute to disease severity scores, including presence of mucosal lesions, impacts of UC on daily activity, experience with biologic treatment, recent hospitalisations, and recent steroid use. The Committee noted that although some of these scores reflect disease activity, these factors are the primary markers to predict a patient’s UC activity in the near future. The Committee considered that disease activity and severity are both necessary to determine the correct treatment pathway for each individual.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there have been no significant new medicines funded for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) since adalimumab was funded in 2006. The Committee noted that there are approximately 20,000 people in New Zealand affected by IBD, and that approximately 40% of these people suffer from UC. </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the incidence of IBD is increasing globally in both industrialized and newly industrializing countries (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27793607/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Kaplan &amp; Ng SC.

The Committee noted that a study from Lakes DHB in 2022 reported that there had been an 8-fold increase in in IBD diagnoses in Māori between the 2011–2015 and 2016–2020 periods, though incidence remains significantly lower than that of non-Māori (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35728240/"" target=""_blank"">Qiu et al.

The Committee considered that due to the highly symptomatic nature of UC, it may be unlikely that those affected would go undiagnosed for long periods of time. The Committee noted that there is no IBD registry in New Zealand, and thus any epidemiological data and information on the incidence of UC in New Zealand may not be representative of the entire population. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that current treatment options for those with moderate to severe UC in New Zealand includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and/or steroids in the first instance, followed by immunomodulators (eg thiopurines with or without steroids) if necessary, followed by surgery. The Committee noted that if an individual has not received sufficient benefit from treatment, if side-effects are intolerable, and surgery is not considered to be a clinically appropriate treatment course, they would be treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent infliximab or adalimumab. The Committee considered that approximately 50% of people would receive infliximab first-line, and 50% would receive adalimumab. The Committee noted that if treatment with anti-TNF agents is no longer appropriate or effective, they do not have other funded treatment options. The Committee noted that it has been estimated that approximately 10–30% of those treated with anti-TNF agents will experience primary non-response (failure of induction therapy) while secondary loss of response occurs in approximately 23–46% patients by 12 months (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845128/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Khan et al.

The Committee noted that currently neither of these agents are funded in this setting. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that although many people develop antidrug antibodies to anti-TNF treatments, clinicians persist with anti-TNF treatment at high doses due to a lack of funded alternatives. The Committee noted that people often have repeated courses of steroids which have long term negative effects, and that ongoing morbidity is high for many individuals. The Committee noted that treatment with corticosteroids should be used as a bridge to further therapy, and not a long-term treatment modality. The Committee also noted that individuals experience increasing hospital admissions due to treatment failure, and that the rates of surgery are now similar to the rates observed before the funding of anti-TNF treatments. The Committee noted that post-surgical morbidity is high for those living with UC who often need stomas and experience diarrhoea, urgency, inability to work, and high caregiver burden.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK-1) which is important in inflammatory cytokine signalling. The Committee noted that the 15 and 30 mg formulation of upadacitinib is Medsafe approved for rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The Committee noted that a submission for use in the treatment of UC has been lodged with Medsafe for use in UC, and 45 mg tablet strength. The Committee noted that JAK-1 inhibitors have a rapid onset of effect compared to anti-TNF agents </p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of upadacitinib for UC is 45 mg once daily for eight to 16 weeks as induction, then 15 or 30 mg once daily based on clinical presentation, with no maximum treatment duration.

The Committee considered that while the placebo population in the maintenance trial had previously received upadacitinib, this was unlikely to impact the week 52 response rates due to the short half-life of upadacitinib (especially in comparison to biologics such as ustekinumab). </p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of moderate/severe UC is not available beyond 52 weeks.

The Committee also noted that rates of UC-related operations were not significantly reduced with upadacitinib treatment, but considered that statistical significance was unlikely to be achieved given the small number of operations occurring in the trial and that longer follow-up will be required to show whether a difference materialises.\xa0The Committee also considered that funding a treatment that contributes to a decrease in hospitalisations would reduce the resource burden in hospitals.\xa0</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment sequencing with regard to biologic treatment is difficult, as most biologic treatments do not have head-to-head published trial data. The Committee noted that the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) score is a tool used in network meta-analysis to compare agents indirectly, with a score of 1 being the best possible outcome. The Committee noted that for biologic naïve patients, infliximab has been reported as having the highest SUCRA ranking for UC (SUCRA score 0.95 for clinical remission), while tofacitinib and ustekinumab have the highest SUCRA scores (SUCRA score 0.87 for both agents for clinical remission) for UC patients previously exposed to anti-TNF agents (infliximab/adalimumab; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945470/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Singh et al.

The Committee considered that funding of upadacitinib would reduce the burden on infusion centres and would be easy to manage in both community and hospital settings. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Costs and Savings </em></h3><p>1.28.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation in which both vedolizumab and upadacitinib were funded, that it would be likely that upadacitinib would be used before vedolizumab for the majority of affected individuals, due to suitability and evidence of benefit. The Committee also considered, however, that vedolizumab would still have a relatively large market share due to the favourable safety profile. The Committee considered that vedolizumab would particularly be used in those who are elderly or who have a higher risk of complications or infection. The Committee considered that usage of vedolizumab in these groups would also occur if vedolizumab and ustekinumab (but not upadacitinib) were funded. </p><p>1.29.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation where vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and upadacitinib were all funded for UC that most individualts would receive upadacitinib following treatment with anti-TNF agents, followed by ustekinumab or vedolizumab. The Committee again noted the favourable safety profile of vedolizumab, and also prescriber familiarity with vedolizumab, and considered that vedolizumab would still be considered beneficial owing to its improved safety.</p><p>1.30.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that treating the elderly with anti-TNF agents poses some risks in terms of safety.

The Committee also considered that it was unclear what factors influence who benefits most from each dosing regimen. The Committee considered that elderly individuals or those with moderate disease may be maintained on the 15mg dose.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria </em></h3><p>1.32.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the population group who would benefit most from funding of upadacitinib is those with moderate/severe UC who have experienced treatment failure (primary or secondary non-response) with infliximab and/or adalimumab. The Committee noted that if an individual experiences remission with infliximab or adalimumab and secondary treatment failure is due to anti-drug antibodies, then a second anti-TNF treatment would typically be trialled before moving them to upadacitinib or another biologic treatment. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it would be appropriate to use either the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) of &gt; 4 or a Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 2-3 to define eligibility for upadacitinib. The Committee considered that endoscopy is generally more accessible than 5-10 years ago, and access to endoscopies is less of a barrier to diagnosis and treatment, though this varies between centres. </p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there is no safety or efficacy data relating to the use of upadacitinib for treatment of UC in the paediatric setting.

The Committee noted that according to the American College of Gastroenterology moderate to severe UC is defined by patients: usually having six or more stools per day, frequently experiencing blood in their stool, often feeling bowel urgency, having a lower haemoglobin than normal, and Mayo endoscopy scores of two to three (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840605/"" target=""_blank"">Rubin et al.

The Committee noted that many factors contribute to disease severity scores, including presence of mucosal lesions, impacts of UC on daily activity, experience with biologic treatment, recent hospitalisations, and recent steroid use. The Committee noted that although some of these scores reflect disease activity, these factors are the primary markers to predict a patient’s UC activity in the near future. The Committee considered that disease activity and severity are both necessary to determine the correct treatment pathway for each individual.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there have been no significant new medicines funded for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) since adalimumab was funded in 2006.

The Committee considered that due to the highly symptomatic nature of UC, it may be unlikely that those affected would go undiagnosed for long periods of time. The Committee noted that there is no IBD registry in New Zealand, and thus any epidemiological data and information on the incidence of UC in New Zealand may not be representative of the entire population. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that current treatment options for those with moderate to severe UC in New Zealand includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and/or steroids in the first instance, followed by immunomodulators (eg thiopurines with or without steroids) if necessary, followed by surgery. The Committee noted that if an individual has not received sufficient benefit from treatment, if side-effects are intolerable, and surgery is not considered to be a clinically appropriate treatment course, they would be treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent infliximab or adalimumab. The Committee considered that approximately 50% of people would receive infliximab first-line, and 50% would receive adalimumab. The Committee noted that if treatment with anti-TNF agents is no longer appropriate or effective, they do not have other funded treatment options. The Committee noted that it has been estimated that approximately 10–30% of those treated with anti-TNF agents will experience primary non-response (failure of induction therapy) while secondary loss of response occurs in approximately 23–46% patients by 12 months (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845128/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Khan et al.

The Committee noted that people often have repeated courses of steroids which have long term negative effects, and that ongoing morbidity is high for many individuals. The Committee noted that treatment with corticosteroids should be used as a bridge to further therapy, and not a long-term treatment modality. The Committee also noted that individuals experience increasing hospital admissions due to treatment failure, and that the rates of surgery are now similar to the rates observed before the funding of anti-TNF treatments. The Committee noted that post-surgical morbidity is high for those living with UC who often need stomas and experience diarrhoea, urgency, inability to work, and high caregiver burden.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK-1) which is important in inflammatory cytokine signalling. The Committee noted that the 15 and 30 mg formulation of upadacitinib is Medsafe approved for rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The Committee noted that a submission for use in the treatment of UC has been lodged with Medsafe for use in UC, and 45 mg tablet strength.

The Committee also noted that maintenance of endoscopic improvement was reported in 62% of the 15 mg group and 70% of the 30 mg group, compared to 19% in the placebo group. The Committee noted that endoscopic remission was reported in 24% of the 15 mg group and 26% of the 30 mg group compared to 6% in the placebo group. The Committee noted that mucosal healing was reported in 18% of the 15 mg group and 19% of the 30 mg group, compared to 5% in the placebo group. </p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that adverse events reported in the trial were generally non-severe and occurred in low rates. The Committee noted small increases in the incidence of hepatic disorder, neutropenia, lymphopenia and CPK elevation in the upadacitinib groups versus the placebo groups in the UC1 and UC2 trials. The Committee also noted a slight increase in the rates of herpes zoster, neutropenia and CPK elevation in the UC3 trial. </p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the strength and quality of the evidence to be high, and that there is high relevance to the New Zealand population concerned. The Committee considered that while the placebo population in the maintenance trial had previously received upadacitinib, this was unlikely to impact the week 52 response rates due to the short half-life of upadacitinib (especially in comparison to biologics such as ustekinumab). </p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of moderate/severe UC is not available beyond 52 weeks. The Committee considered that safety data relating to the use of upadacitinib beyond 52 weeks should not be different to that of other indications, which have longer-term data available. </p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted an unpublished network meta-analysis provided by the supplier that indirectly compared upadacitinib, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab at week 6-10 of induction and 52-60 weeks of maintenance compared to placebo. The Committee noted that upadacitinib possibly performed better than the other two agents regarding clinical remission, clinical response, and mucosal healing, but such signals were substantially limited by the comparisons being only indirect. </p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment with upadacitinib statistically significantly reduced the rates of UC-related hospitalisations in the UC1 and UC3 trials. The Committee also noted that rates of UC-related operations were not significantly reduced with upadacitinib treatment, but considered that statistical significance was unlikely to be achieved given the small number of operations occurring in the trial and that longer follow-up will be required to show whether a difference materialises.\xa0The Committee also considered that funding a treatment that contributes to a decrease in hospitalisations would reduce the resource burden in hospitals.\xa0</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment sequencing with regard to biologic treatment is difficult, as most biologic treatments do not have head-to-head published trial data. The Committee noted that the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) score is a tool used in network meta-analysis to compare agents indirectly, with a score of 1 being the best possible outcome. The Committee noted that for biologic naïve patients, infliximab has been reported as having the highest SUCRA ranking for UC (SUCRA score 0.95 for clinical remission), while tofacitinib and ustekinumab have the highest SUCRA scores (SUCRA score 0.87 for both agents for clinical remission) for UC patients previously exposed to anti-TNF agents (infliximab/adalimumab; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945470/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Singh et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020;18:2179-91</a>). The Committee noted that vedolizumab was reported as having the lowest risk of infection (SUCRA score 0.81). The Committee noted that adalimumab was the lowest ranked treatment for anti-TNF exposed patients. The Committee noted that this network meta-analysis was published prior to publication of trial results for upadacitinib for UC. </p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the sequencing/order of treatment is not as important as the availability of treatment, and that each line of treatment would likely reduce the treatment gap further (ie provide additional benefit to those patients with an unmet health need). The Committee noted that patient preference studies have reported that UC patients are more concerned about complications of their disease (such as increased risk of colon cancer or the possible need for an ostomy) than they are about possible side-effects of treatments (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26950308/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Thompson et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2016;22:940-7</a>). The Committee also noted that patients are more likely to accept significant mortality risks to avoid surgery or ostomy (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24280881/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Bewtra et al.

The Committee considered that funding of upadacitinib would reduce the burden on infusion centres and would be easy to manage in both community and hospital settings. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Costs and Savings </em></h3><p>1.28.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation in which both vedolizumab and upadacitinib were funded, that it would be likely that upadacitinib would be used before vedolizumab for the majority of affected individuals, due to suitability and evidence of benefit. The Committee also considered, however, that vedolizumab would still have a relatively large market share due to the favourable safety profile. The Committee considered that vedolizumab would particularly be used in those who are elderly or who have a higher risk of complications or infection. The Committee considered that usage of vedolizumab in these groups would also occur if vedolizumab and ustekinumab (but not upadacitinib) were funded. </p><p>1.29.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation where vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and upadacitinib were all funded for UC that most individualts would receive upadacitinib following treatment with anti-TNF agents, followed by ustekinumab or vedolizumab. The Committee again noted the favourable safety profile of vedolizumab, and also prescriber familiarity with vedolizumab, and considered that vedolizumab would still be considered beneficial owing to its improved safety.</p><p>1.30.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that treating the elderly with anti-TNF agents poses some risks in terms of safety. The Committee considered that approximately 30% of people would be treated with vedolizumab in the first-line setting if it were available. </p><p>1.31.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear how many people would receive the 15mg maintenance dose of upadacitinib, and how many would receive the 30mg maintenance dose. The Committee also considered that it was unclear what factors influence who benefits most from each dosing regimen. The Committee considered that elderly individuals or those with moderate disease may be maintained on the 15mg dose.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria </em></h3><p>1.32.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the population group who would benefit most from funding of upadacitinib is those with moderate/severe UC who have experienced treatment failure (primary or secondary non-response) with infliximab and/or adalimumab. The Committee noted that if an individual experiences remission with infliximab or adalimumab and secondary treatment failure is due to anti-drug antibodies, then a second anti-TNF treatment would typically be trialled before moving them to upadacitinib or another biologic treatment. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it would be appropriate to use either the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) of &gt; 4 or a Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 2-3 to define eligibility for upadacitinib. The Committee considered that endoscopy is generally more accessible than 5-10 years ago, and access to endoscopies is less of a barrier to diagnosis and treatment, though this varies between centres. </p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there is no safety or efficacy data relating to the use of upadacitinib for treatment of UC in the paediatric setting. The Committee noted that there is some data for the use of vedolizumab in this setting. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary for Assessment </em></h3><p>1.35.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for upadacitinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the second-line biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.

The Committee noted that according to the American College of Gastroenterology moderate to severe UC is defined by patients: usually having six or more stools per day, frequently experiencing blood in their stool, often feeling bowel urgency, having a lower haemoglobin than normal, and Mayo endoscopy scores of two to three (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840605/"" target=""_blank"">Rubin et al.

The Committee noted that many factors contribute to disease severity scores, including presence of mucosal lesions, impacts of UC on daily activity, experience with biologic treatment, recent hospitalisations, and recent steroid use. The Committee noted that although some of these scores reflect disease activity, these factors are the primary markers to predict a patient’s UC activity in the near future. The Committee considered that disease activity and severity are both necessary to determine the correct treatment pathway for each individual.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there have been no significant new medicines funded for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) since adalimumab was funded in 2006.

The Committee considered that due to the highly symptomatic nature of UC, it may be unlikely that those affected would go undiagnosed for long periods of time.

The Committee noted that if an individual has not received sufficient benefit from treatment, if side-effects are intolerable, and surgery is not considered to be a clinically appropriate treatment course, they would be treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent infliximab or adalimumab. The Committee considered that approximately 50% of people would receive infliximab first-line, and 50% would receive adalimumab. The Committee noted that if treatment with anti-TNF agents is no longer appropriate or effective, they do not have other funded treatment options. The Committee noted that it has been estimated that approximately 10–30% of those treated with anti-TNF agents will experience primary non-response (failure of induction therapy) while secondary loss of response occurs in approximately 23–46% patients by 12 months (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845128/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Khan et al.

The Committee noted that currently neither of these agents are funded in this setting. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that although many people develop antidrug antibodies to anti-TNF treatments, clinicians persist with anti-TNF treatment at high doses due to a lack of funded alternatives. The Committee noted that people often have repeated courses of steroids which have long term negative effects, and that ongoing morbidity is high for many individuals. The Committee noted that treatment with corticosteroids should be used as a bridge to further therapy, and not a long-term treatment modality. The Committee also noted that individuals experience increasing hospital admissions due to treatment failure, and that the rates of surgery are now similar to the rates observed before the funding of anti-TNF treatments. The Committee noted that post-surgical morbidity is high for those living with UC who often need stomas and experience diarrhoea, urgency, inability to work, and high caregiver burden.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK-1) which is important in inflammatory cytokine signalling. The Committee noted that the 15 and 30 mg formulation of upadacitinib is Medsafe approved for rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The Committee noted that a submission for use in the treatment of UC has been lodged with Medsafe for use in UC, and 45 mg tablet strength. The Committee noted that JAK-1 inhibitors have a rapid onset of effect compared to anti-TNF agents </p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of upadacitinib for UC is 45 mg once daily for eight to 16 weeks as induction, then 15 or 30 mg once daily based on clinical presentation, with no maximum treatment duration. The Committee noted that the 15 mg daily dosing would be most appropriate for those with a lower burden of disease or who are of a more advanced age. </p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the application was for second-line treatment following failure of, or intolerable side effects from, anti-TNF agents infliximab and/or adalimumab. The Committee noted that for inidividuals for whom upadacitinib is not effective, surgical management would be considered where appropriate.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the published results from three upadacitinib UC trials where upadacitinib treatment was compared with placebo (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35644166/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Danese et al. Lancet. 2022;399:2113-28</a>), which included two replicate eight-week induction studies (U-ACHIEVE induction [UC1] and U-ACCOMPLISH [UC2] with 45 mg upadacitinib versus placebo) and a single 52-week maintenance study for those who responded in the induction phase (U-ACHIEVE maintenance [UC3] with 30 or 15 mg upadacitinib versus placebo). The Committee noted that the participants in the trials had moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (adapted Mayo score 5–9; endoscopic sub score 2 or 3), were between 16 and 75 years of age, and that many had received previous treatment with 5-ASA (68%), steroids (40%), immunomodulators (1-2%) and biologics (~50%). </p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in UC1, 26% of patients in the upadacitinib arm experienced clinical remission (as per the adapted Mayo score) compared to 5% in the placebo group (adjusted treatment difference 21.6%; 95% CI 15.8 to 27.4). The Committee also noted that endoscopic improvement was seen in 36% of upadacitinib treated patients versus 7% of placebo treated patients, with endoscopic remission reported as 14% and 1%, respectively. The Committee noted that a clinical response (as per the adapted Mayo score) was reported in 73% of upadacitinib patients versus 27% of placebo treated patients, with histological-endoscopic mucosal improvement seen in 30% versus 6%, respectively. The Committee also noted that mucosal healing was reported in 11% of the upadacitinib treated group versus 1% in the placebo group. </p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in UC2, 44% of patients in the upadacitinib arm experienced clinical remission (as per the adapted Mayo score) compared to 4% in the placebo group (adjusted treatment difference 35.1%; 95% CI 28.6 to 41.6). The Committee also noted that endoscopic improvement was seen in 44% of upadacitinib treated patients versus 8% of placebo treated patients, with endoscopic remission reported as 18% and 2%, respectively. The Committee noted that a clinical response (as per the adapted Mayo score) was reported in 74% of upadacitinib patients versus 25% of placebo treated patients, with histological-endoscopic mucosal improvement seen in 36% versus 6%, respectively.

The Committee also noted that 49% of the 15 mg group and 62% of the 30 mg group were reported to have endoscopic improvement, compared to 14% in the placebo group. The Committee noted that maintenance of clinical remission (as per adapted Mayo score) was reported in 57% of the 15 mg group and 68% of the 30 mg group compared to 22% in the placebo group. </p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that corticosteroid-free clinical remission was reported in 57% of the 15 mg group and 68% in the 30 mg group, compared to 22% in placebo treated patients. The Committee also noted that maintenance of endoscopic improvement was reported in 62% of the 15 mg group and 70% of the 30 mg group, compared to 19% in the placebo group. The Committee noted that endoscopic remission was reported in 24% of the 15 mg group and 26% of the 30 mg group compared to 6% in the placebo group.

The Committee noted small increases in the incidence of hepatic disorder, neutropenia, lymphopenia and CPK elevation in the upadacitinib groups versus the placebo groups in the UC1 and UC2 trials. The Committee also noted a slight increase in the rates of herpes zoster, neutropenia and CPK elevation in the UC3 trial. </p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the strength and quality of the evidence to be high, and that there is high relevance to the New Zealand population concerned. The Committee considered that while the placebo population in the maintenance trial had previously received upadacitinib, this was unlikely to impact the week 52 response rates due to the short half-life of upadacitinib (especially in comparison to biologics such as ustekinumab). </p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of moderate/severe UC is not available beyond 52 weeks. The Committee considered that safety data relating to the use of upadacitinib beyond 52 weeks should not be different to that of other indications, which have longer-term data available. </p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted an unpublished network meta-analysis provided by the supplier that indirectly compared upadacitinib, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab at week 6-10 of induction and 52-60 weeks of maintenance compared to placebo. The Committee noted that upadacitinib possibly performed better than the other two agents regarding clinical remission, clinical response, and mucosal healing, but such signals were substantially limited by the comparisons being only indirect. </p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment with upadacitinib statistically significantly reduced the rates of UC-related hospitalisations in the UC1 and UC3 trials. The Committee also noted that rates of UC-related operations were not significantly reduced with upadacitinib treatment, but considered that statistical significance was unlikely to be achieved given the small number of operations occurring in the trial and that longer follow-up will be required to show whether a difference materialises.\xa0The Committee also considered that funding a treatment that contributes to a decrease in hospitalisations would reduce the resource burden in hospitals.\xa0</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment sequencing with regard to biologic treatment is difficult, as most biologic treatments do not have head-to-head published trial data. The Committee noted that the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) score is a tool used in network meta-analysis to compare agents indirectly, with a score of 1 being the best possible outcome. The Committee noted that for biologic naïve patients, infliximab has been reported as having the highest SUCRA ranking for UC (SUCRA score 0.95 for clinical remission), while tofacitinib and ustekinumab have the highest SUCRA scores (SUCRA score 0.87 for both agents for clinical remission) for UC patients previously exposed to anti-TNF agents (infliximab/adalimumab; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945470/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Singh et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020;18:2179-91</a>). The Committee noted that vedolizumab was reported as having the lowest risk of infection (SUCRA score 0.81). The Committee noted that adalimumab was the lowest ranked treatment for anti-TNF exposed patients. The Committee noted that this network meta-analysis was published prior to publication of trial results for upadacitinib for UC. </p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the sequencing/order of treatment is not as important as the availability of treatment, and that each line of treatment would likely reduce the treatment gap further (ie provide additional benefit to those patients with an unmet health need). The Committee noted that patient preference studies have reported that UC patients are more concerned about complications of their disease (such as increased risk of colon cancer or the possible need for an ostomy) than they are about possible side-effects of treatments (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26950308/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Thompson et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2016;22:940-7</a>). The Committee also noted that patients are more likely to accept significant mortality risks to avoid surgery or ostomy (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24280881/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"">Bewtra et al.

The Committee considered that funding of upadacitinib would reduce the burden on infusion centres and would be easy to manage in both community and hospital settings. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Costs and Savings </em></h3><p>1.28.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation in which both vedolizumab and upadacitinib were funded, that it would be likely that upadacitinib would be used before vedolizumab for the majority of affected individuals, due to suitability and evidence of benefit. The Committee also considered, however, that vedolizumab would still have a relatively large market share due to the favourable safety profile. The Committee considered that vedolizumab would particularly be used in those who are elderly or who have a higher risk of complications or infection. The Committee considered that usage of vedolizumab in these groups would also occur if vedolizumab and ustekinumab (but not upadacitinib) were funded. </p><p>1.29.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that in a situation where vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and upadacitinib were all funded for UC that most individualts would receive upadacitinib following treatment with anti-TNF agents, followed by ustekinumab or vedolizumab. The Committee again noted the favourable safety profile of vedolizumab, and also prescriber familiarity with vedolizumab, and considered that vedolizumab would still be considered beneficial owing to its improved safety.</p><p>1.30.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that treating the elderly with anti-TNF agents poses some risks in terms of safety. The Committee considered that approximately 30% of people would be treated with vedolizumab in the first-line setting if it were available. </p><p>1.31.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear how many people would receive the 15mg maintenance dose of upadacitinib, and how many would receive the 30mg maintenance dose. The Committee also considered that it was unclear what factors influence who benefits most from each dosing regimen. The Committee considered that elderly individuals or those with moderate disease may be maintained on the 15mg dose.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria </em></h3><p>1.32.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the population group who would benefit most from funding of upadacitinib is those with moderate/severe UC who have experienced treatment failure (primary or secondary non-response) with infliximab and/or adalimumab. The Committee noted that if an individual experiences remission with infliximab or adalimumab and secondary treatment failure is due to anti-drug antibodies, then a second anti-TNF treatment would typically be trialled before moving them to upadacitinib or another biologic treatment. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it would be appropriate to use either the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) of &gt; 4 or a Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 2-3 to define eligibility for upadacitinib. The Committee considered that endoscopy is generally more accessible than 5-10 years ago, and access to endoscopies is less of a barrier to diagnosis and treatment, though this varies between centres. </p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there is no safety or efficacy data relating to the use of upadacitinib for treatment of UC in the paediatric setting. The Committee noted that there is some data for the use of vedolizumab in this setting. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary for Assessment </em></h3><p>1.35.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for upadacitinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the second-line biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
