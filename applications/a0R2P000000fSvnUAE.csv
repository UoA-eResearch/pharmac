The Committee noted that obesity is the most significant risk factor, and that the rates of obesity in New Zealand are increasing across all age groups, including children and adolescents.

(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706899/"" target=""_blank"">Sleep. 2009;32:949–956</a>), which estimated the prevalence of OSA-related excessive daytime sleepiness in New Zealand to be 12.5% of males and 3.4% of females between the ages of 30 and 59. The Committee considered that the prevalence is probably higher than this estimate due to the increased prevalence of obesity in New Zealand since the study was published in 2009. The Committee also noted that this study reported that rates of OSAS were higher for Māori men and women than for non-Māori, but noted that in the Wellington Community Study by the same authors, which adjusted for neck size (as a measure of obesity) and BMI, there were no significant differences in OSAS prevalence between the Māori and non-Māori populations (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706899/"" target=""_blank"">Mihaere et al. Sleep. 2009;32:949–956</a>). The Committee noted that there is currently no data available for prevalence of OSAS in the New Zealand Pacific population but considered that the prevalence of OSAS in this population would also be elevated due to high rates of obesity.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are various measures available to assess a patient’s degree of OSAS: </p><p>1.9.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which is a short questionnaire that asks respondents about their perceived likelihood of falling asleep in 8 different scenarios, such as sitting or travelling. The Committee noted a study by Patel et al. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28961021/"" target=""_blank"">Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018;197:961-963)</a> indicating that a change of -2 to -3 in the ESS is the minimal difference required for improvement in excessive somnolence to be considered clinically significant.

The Committee noted that a sleep latency of less than 8 minutes is consistent with evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. The Committee noted that the MSLT can only be assessed in sleep centres, which are available in major centres, but not country wide.</p><p>1.9.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), which is an objective measure of a patient’s ability to stay awake and alert during the day and consists of four sleep trials with 2-hour breaks between them.

The Committee also noted that patients with mild to moderate OSA can benefit from using mandibular advancement splints. The Committee noted that patients with moderate to severe OSA also have the option of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty surgery and adenotonsillectomy but acknowledged that these surgical procedures are associated with potential perioperative morbidity and mortality. The Committee also considered that patients for whom obesity is the cause of OSA, and for whom nCPAP has been ineffective, may also benefit from bariatric surgery </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current mainstay of treatment for patients with more severe OSA is nCPAP but considered that adherence to treatment needs to be optimised and monitored as the machine can be cumbersome and uncomfortable for patients to use while sleeping. The Committee noted that international data indicates that the prevalence of OSAS with adequate nCPAP treatment is between 6 and 14% <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19407048"" target=""_blank"">(Pepin et al.

The Committee noted that mean ESS scores were reduced with both modafinil and placebo at week 4 (p˂0.001), which was indicative of a placebo effect.

The Committee also noted that there was a significantly greater percentage of modafinil patients with normalised ESS at week 4 compared with placebo (51% and 27% respectively, p˂0.01).

The Committee considered that patients experiencing socioeconomic deprivation are less likely to seek secondary or tertiary care for their OSA and are therefore less likely to undergo the sleep studies needed to obtain treatment such as nCPAP. Additionally, the Committee considered that the inequity is heightened due to the variability in DHB funding criteria and the availability of sleep centres for sleep studies, which are a requirement prior to receipt of funded nCPAP machines. Thus, patients may need to visit private sleep clinics if services are not offered by their DHB.
