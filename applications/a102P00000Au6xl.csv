The Subcommittee noted that approximately 10% of women will have prolapse or incontinence surgery in their lifetime (<a href=""https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4/epdf/full"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2020;11:DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4</a>). The Subcommittee noted that current treatment options include pelvic floor muscle training, lifestyle changes, pessary, or surgery, and that treatment choice depends on a number of factors including age, severity of symptoms, surgical history, treatment preference and cultural factors. The Subcommittee noted that clinicians are most likely to fit pessaries in women aged over 60 years or in those who are unfit for surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current barriers to access in New Zealand include delays in availability of public gynaecology services in some areas, as well as limited specialist pelvic floor physiotherapists, and the cost of primary care and private services. The Subcommittee noted that there is significant variability nationwide in access to funding in community settings for ring pessaries, with some DHBs providing community-based funding.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that symptomatic pelvic prolapse has a significant and negative impact on the individual including physical symptoms such as urinary, bowel, and sexual discomfort, as well as having a negative effect on body image, quality of life, mental wellbeing and the ability to perform daily activities, undertake work or recreational activities. The Subcommittee considered that there was a direct cost on family and whānau, such as the cost of continence products and primary healthcare services. The Subcommittee considered that Māori and Pacific women are likely disproportionately affected by pelvic floor prolapse (though there is no direct evidence for this) due to increased risk factors (eg. high parity, obesity rates, manual work), and have more limited access to treatment options. The Subcommittee also considered that there are other groups experiencing health disparities relating to pelvic prolapse, such as patients with disabilities, or those who are non-binary.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that community funding of ring pessaries would have a positive impact on the government health priorities of improving mental wellbeing, and creating a strong and equitable public health system.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding of ring pessaries in the community would benefit individuals by providing improved access to options for care, reduce time and make it easier for patients to access services (such as those in regional and rural communities), and offer more people the solution of a low-risk intervention compared to surgery. The Subcommittee also considered that there would be a benefit to whānau and family in that patients would be able to take part in whānau and community activities if accessible treatment was more available.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there would also be a benefit to the wider health system in that there would be a reduced demand on gynaecology services, and a potential reduction in the demand for surgery. However, the Subcommittee considered that funded ring pessaries in the community may shift the demand onto an already overloaded primary healthcare system. Members also considered that cost could shift to patients if their DHB did not fund insertion services in primary care and that this could present a barrier to access and uptake in some areas. In addition there would be the need for further training for some primary healthcare providers, although Members noted that ring pessary insertion is relatively straightforward. The Subcommittee noted that ring pessaries are a relatively low-cost intervention compared to pelvic floor muscle training and surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that pessaries are not without risk, in that failure rates of up to 50% have been recorded (compared to a 30% risk of failure from surgery), and that there is a small risk of bleeding, ulceration, and loss of the device. The Subcommittee noted that the risks from surgery for pelvic prolapse are most commonly associated with anaesthetic use and thrombosis, and that the thrombosis risk is increased for Māori and Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that overall, the severity of risks associated with surgery were higher than those for ring pessary use.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the Cochrane systematic review of the use of ring pessaries in the management of pelvic organ prolapse in women (<a href=""https://www.cochrane.org/CD004010/INCONT_pessaries-mechanical-devices-managing-pelvic-organ-prolapse-women"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2020;11. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the review included four studies involving a total of 478 women with various stages of prolapse, which concluded that there is uncertainty regarding whether or not pessaries improve prolapse symptoms for women with no treatment of pelvic floor muscle training. The Subcommittee noted, however, that pessaries in combination with pelvic floor muscle training probably improved patient’s symptoms but noted that there may be an increased risk of adverse events with pessaries when compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the review (<a href=""https://www.cochrane.org/CD004010/INCONT_pessaries-mechanical-devices-managing-pelvic-organ-prolapse-women"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al.

The Subcommittee also noted that evidence from observational studies suggests that about 76% of women who try a pessary continue to use it for at least four weeks and, of those women who continue pessary use for more than four weeks, 86% continued to use the pessary for over five years (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21575953/"" target=""_blank"">Lone et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the findings were that pessary use may improve symptoms of pelvic floor prolapse but that the evidence was low-grade, and that pessary use may be cost-effective when used within a ‘stepped-care’ model (a sequence of interventions followed after the current treatment proves ineffective). The Subcommittee noted that direct patient interviews reported that ring pessary use was an effective treatment option for symptom management, and that conflicting evidence from health providers and long wait times were seen as common barriers to access.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of evidence for the use of pessaries comes from non‐randomised studies with small patient numbers, and as such, the effectiveness of pessaries for managing pelvic organ prolapse still needs to be clearly established. The Subcommittee noted that there is a lack of consensus as to the optimal treatment for women. The Subcommittee reiterated that this funding application related to a service shift and improved access, rather than the availability of a new treatment as ring pessaries are currently administered in secondary care. The Subcommittee considered that while the evidence for the use of ring pessaries for pelvic prolapse was of low quality, that ring pessaries are widely recommended as a cost-effective treatment option for women with symptomatic pelvic floor prolapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that pessaries are an acceptable option for many women, and that the ability to provide pessaries through primary care facilities may decrease the wait times often experienced with secondary care services. The Subcommittee considered that the ability of nurse practitioners and pelvic floor physiotherapists to perform insertions of pessaries may alleviate some pressure on GPs in terms of appointment volume.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was unclear how the funding of pessaries in primary care would impact patient numbers, however that it would be likely to increase their use, due to improved accessibility. The Subcommittee also noted that many women see pelvic prolapse as a consequence of childbirth and as a condition to be ‘lived with’, and often do not seek treatment. The Subcommittee considered that these women may contribute to an increased uptake of pessary use if information is provided to them through a primary care service.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are suitability elements of ring pessary use, and that patients are more likely to accept ring pessaries as a treatment if they are appropriately counselled about the intervention and in some circumstances taught to remove them themselves, as this can enable individuals to feel more in control of their treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple shapes and types of pessaries and considered that ring pessaries are the most appropriate and easiest to insert in most cases, as well as having the least risk associated. The Subcommittee considered that if non-ring pessaries were to be funded, additional training and education would be necessary to mitigate the risk of adverse events.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered there are no other indications in which a ring pessary would be used other than pelvic prolapse and as such it did not recommend that a Special Authority be imposed noting that it would predominantly present as a barrier to access rather than appropriate targeting of treatment.

The Subcommittee noted that approximately 10% of women will have prolapse or incontinence surgery in their lifetime (<a href=""https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4/epdf/full"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2020;11:DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4</a>). The Subcommittee noted that current treatment options include pelvic floor muscle training, lifestyle changes, pessary, or surgery, and that treatment choice depends on a number of factors including age, severity of symptoms, surgical history, treatment preference and cultural factors. The Subcommittee noted that clinicians are most likely to fit pessaries in women aged over 60 years or in those who are unfit for surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current barriers to access in New Zealand include delays in availability of public gynaecology services in some areas, as well as limited specialist pelvic floor physiotherapists, and the cost of primary care and private services. The Subcommittee noted that there is significant variability nationwide in access to funding in community settings for ring pessaries, with some DHBs providing community-based funding.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that symptomatic pelvic prolapse has a significant and negative impact on the individual including physical symptoms such as urinary, bowel, and sexual discomfort, as well as having a negative effect on body image, quality of life, mental wellbeing and the ability to perform daily activities, undertake work or recreational activities. The Subcommittee considered that there was a direct cost on family and whānau, such as the cost of continence products and primary healthcare services. The Subcommittee considered that Māori and Pacific women are likely disproportionately affected by pelvic floor prolapse (though there is no direct evidence for this) due to increased risk factors (eg. high parity, obesity rates, manual work), and have more limited access to treatment options. The Subcommittee also considered that there are other groups experiencing health disparities relating to pelvic prolapse, such as patients with disabilities, or those who are non-binary.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that community funding of ring pessaries would have a positive impact on the government health priorities of improving mental wellbeing, and creating a strong and equitable public health system.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding of ring pessaries in the community would benefit individuals by providing improved access to options for care, reduce time and make it easier for patients to access services (such as those in regional and rural communities), and offer more people the solution of a low-risk intervention compared to surgery. The Subcommittee also considered that there would be a benefit to whānau and family in that patients would be able to take part in whānau and community activities if accessible treatment was more available.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there would also be a benefit to the wider health system in that there would be a reduced demand on gynaecology services, and a potential reduction in the demand for surgery. However, the Subcommittee considered that funded ring pessaries in the community may shift the demand onto an already overloaded primary healthcare system. Members also considered that cost could shift to patients if their DHB did not fund insertion services in primary care and that this could present a barrier to access and uptake in some areas. In addition there would be the need for further training for some primary healthcare providers, although Members noted that ring pessary insertion is relatively straightforward. The Subcommittee noted that ring pessaries are a relatively low-cost intervention compared to pelvic floor muscle training and surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that pessaries are not without risk, in that failure rates of up to 50% have been recorded (compared to a 30% risk of failure from surgery), and that there is a small risk of bleeding, ulceration, and loss of the device. The Subcommittee noted that the risks from surgery for pelvic prolapse are most commonly associated with anaesthetic use and thrombosis, and that the thrombosis risk is increased for Māori and Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that overall, the severity of risks associated with surgery were higher than those for ring pessary use.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the Cochrane systematic review of the use of ring pessaries in the management of pelvic organ prolapse in women (<a href=""https://www.cochrane.org/CD004010/INCONT_pessaries-mechanical-devices-managing-pelvic-organ-prolapse-women"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2020;11. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the review included four studies involving a total of 478 women with various stages of prolapse, which concluded that there is uncertainty regarding whether or not pessaries improve prolapse symptoms for women with no treatment of pelvic floor muscle training. The Subcommittee noted, however, that pessaries in combination with pelvic floor muscle training probably improved patient’s symptoms but noted that there may be an increased risk of adverse events with pessaries when compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the review (<a href=""https://www.cochrane.org/CD004010/INCONT_pessaries-mechanical-devices-managing-pelvic-organ-prolapse-women"" target=""_blank"">Bugge et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2020;11. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004010.pub4</a>) also reported on two economic evaluation studies which compared pessary treatment to alternative interventions (pelvic floor muscle training, expectant management, and surgical procedures) and\xa0indicated better outcomes and lower costs for pessary treated groups when compared to pelvic floor muscle training rather than no intervention.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that recently published <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng123"" target=""_blank"">NICE guidance</a> recommends consideration of pessary use in women who have symptomatic prolapse, but that the quality of evidence was considered to be low to very low. The Subcommittee also noted that evidence from observational studies suggests that about 76% of women who try a pessary continue to use it for at least four weeks and, of those women who continue pessary use for more than four weeks, 86% continued to use the pessary for over five years (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21575953/"" target=""_blank"">Lone et al. Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2011;114:56-9</a>). Furthermore, the Subcommittee noted that pessaries have been shown to improve symptoms in women with pelvic floor prolapse in observational studies (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22222673/"" target=""_blank"">Manchana T, Bunyavejchevin S. Int Urogynecol J. 2012;23:873-7</a>; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00192-011-1390-7"" target=""_blank"">Lamers et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the findings were that pessary use may improve symptoms of pelvic floor prolapse but that the evidence was low-grade, and that pessary use may be cost-effective when used within a ‘stepped-care’ model (a sequence of interventions followed after the current treatment proves ineffective). The Subcommittee noted that direct patient interviews reported that ring pessary use was an effective treatment option for symptom management, and that conflicting evidence from health providers and long wait times were seen as common barriers to access.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of evidence for the use of pessaries comes from non‐randomised studies with small patient numbers, and as such, the effectiveness of pessaries for managing pelvic organ prolapse still needs to be clearly established. The Subcommittee noted that there is a lack of consensus as to the optimal treatment for women. The Subcommittee reiterated that this funding application related to a service shift and improved access, rather than the availability of a new treatment as ring pessaries are currently administered in secondary care. The Subcommittee considered that while the evidence for the use of ring pessaries for pelvic prolapse was of low quality, that ring pessaries are widely recommended as a cost-effective treatment option for women with symptomatic pelvic floor prolapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that pessaries are an acceptable option for many women, and that the ability to provide pessaries through primary care facilities may decrease the wait times often experienced with secondary care services. The Subcommittee considered that the ability of nurse practitioners and pelvic floor physiotherapists to perform insertions of pessaries may alleviate some pressure on GPs in terms of appointment volume.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was unclear how the funding of pessaries in primary care would impact patient numbers, however that it would be likely to increase their use, due to improved accessibility. The Subcommittee also noted that many women see pelvic prolapse as a consequence of childbirth and as a condition to be ‘lived with’, and often do not seek treatment. The Subcommittee considered that these women may contribute to an increased uptake of pessary use if information is provided to them through a primary care service.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are suitability elements of ring pessary use, and that patients are more likely to accept ring pessaries as a treatment if they are appropriately counselled about the intervention and in some circumstances taught to remove them themselves, as this can enable individuals to feel more in control of their treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple shapes and types of pessaries and considered that ring pessaries are the most appropriate and easiest to insert in most cases, as well as having the least risk associated.
