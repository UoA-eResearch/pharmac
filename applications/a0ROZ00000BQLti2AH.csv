The Subcommittee considered the health need of patients with NSCLC is well documented in previous CaTSoP and PTAC records and that the content of those records remains accurate in this regard.\xa0</p><p>7.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted that international treatment guidelines recommend molecular testing for all patients with metastatic non-squamous lung cancer to identify potential therapeutic targets. The Subcommittee noted that approximately 65% of New Zealand patients with NSCLC received EGFR mutation testing in 2014 leading to an estimated prevalence of EGFRm positive disease of approximately 15.5% if all patients with NSCLC were tested (Tin Tin et al. Cancer Epidemiol. 2018;57:24-32).\xa0</p><p>7.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that mutation testing currently uses tumour tissue based samples, however, members considered that about 15-25% of patients may not be physically able to undergo the\xa0biopsy procedure required. The Subcommittee noted that liquid (blood) based testing is currently undertaken internationally and within some New Zealand centres, using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) typically via either private funding or as part of a clinical trial. The Subcommittee noted that some laboratories are developing their own assays, however, access to biopsies and testing is variable.\xa0\xa0</p><p>7.11.\tThe Subcommittee considered the capability to undertake ctDNA testing consistently throughout New Zealand without the requirement for tissue biopsy would enable a greater number of patients to be tested for EGFR mutations. Members considered that ctDNA testing is likely to be introduced within the next five years and that there would be further evolution of mutation testing in New Zealand to track changes over time. The Subcommittee reiterated its suggestion for Pharmac to engage with laboratory representatives, noting the range of potential EGFR mutations and resistance mechanisms, with complexity and testing likely to increase over time.</p><p>7.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted that people with EGFRm positive NSCLC currently receive first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib, followed by second and third-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 60-80% of patients with EGFRm positive NSCLC respond to first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib (time to progression of between 9.2 to 13.1 months based on Wang et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2012;4:19-29), and approximately 40-60% of these patients will develop T790M mutation (based on Hata et al. Cancer. 2013;119:4325-32 and Chai et al. Cancer Manag Res. 2020;12:5439-50), signalling disease progression and acquired treatment resistance. The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no funded treatment to specifically target T790M mutation positive disease.</p><p>7.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered the target EGFRm positive NSCLC population is mutually exclusive to the PD-L1 positive population with NSCLC and funding a new agent in this population would be unlikely to impact the broader funded treatment paradigm for NSCLC. The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitors are not as effective in patients with driver mutations, although the evidence for checkpoint inhibitors and driver mutation targeting agents is evolving.</p><p>7.14.\tThe Subcommittee noted that osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been investigated for EGFRm positive NSCLC in the phase III FLAURA (first-line osimertinib vs gefitinib or erlotinib) and AURA-3 (second-line osimertinib vs pemetrexed with carboplatin/cisplatin in T790M mutation positive disease) clinical trials. The Subcommittee noted that other third generation TKIs have been unsuccessful in trials therefore osimertinib was the only third generation TKI currently available.\xa0</p><p>7.15.\tThe Subcommittee was made aware of evidence that, similar to first-generation TKIs, patients inevitably develop resistance to osimertinib either in the first- or second-line setting and considered that this may lead to resistance mechanisms that would either enable subsequent treatment options (eg first-generation TKIs, erlotinib and/or gefitinib) to be effective or render them ineffective (Leonetti et al. Br J Cancer. 2019; 121: 725–37). The Subcommittee considered it was unclear what the impact of these cross-resistant mechanisms would be on usage of erlotinib or gefitinib in the second line.\xa0</p><p>7.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that funding agencies in Australia (PBAC), England and Wales (NICE) and Canada (CADTH) have recommended osimertinib be funded in both the first- and second-line settings; however, osimertinib is recommended only as a second line treatment for patients with EGFRm T790M positive NSCLC by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). The Subcommittee also noted that osimertinib is recommended only as a first-line treatment for EGFRm positive NSCLC by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (Hanna et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:1040-91).</p><p>Osimertinib in the first-line</p><p>7.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted the application for osimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm positive NSCLC targeted patients with stage IIIb or stage IV NSCLC who were treatment-naïve or had discontinued treatment with erlotinib/gefitinib due to intolerance (not progression), and who had WHO performance status of two or less.\xa0</p><p>7.18.\tThe Subcommittee noted the key evidence for osimertinib in this setting comes from the phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1) controlled FLAURA trial of osimertinib (80 mg once daily) compared with gefitinib (250 mg once daily) or erlotinib (150 mg once daily) in 556 treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm positive NSCLC (Soria et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;372:113-25).\xa0</p><p>7.18.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial population was limited to only a few possible EGFR mutations, was generally well balanced between treatment groups and considered that, although there was a greater proportion of Asian participants than the New Zealand population, the population appeared relevant to the New Zealand context.\xa0</p><p>7.18.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients received gefitinib in the comparator group (66%) compared to erlotinib, but considered the inverse to be true for New Zealand standard of care. Members considered, however, that the choice of first generation TKI was unlikely to make a difference in terms of subsequent eligible population, and considered the FLAURA trial comparators were comparable to standard of care.\xa0</p><p>7.18.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial reported an outcome of median PFS of 18.9 months with osimertinib compared to 10.2 months with the standard TKI comparator (hazard ratio [HR] for disease progression or death 0.46, 95%: CI 0.37-0.57, P&lt;0.001) and noted that this PFS benefit of osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs was statistically significant across all subgroups.</p><p>7.18.4.\tThe Subcommittee noted that an updated publication of the FLAURA trial reported median overall survival (OS) of 38.6 months in the osimertinib group compared with 31.8 months in the comparator arm (HR 0.80, 95.05% CI: 0.64-1.00; P=0.046) (Ramalingam et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:41-50). The Subcommittee considered that the data for up to three years of follow-up indicated a significant benefit in OS from osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs, noting that a number of patients remained on randomised first-line treatment at three years (78 [28%] in the osimertinib group and 26 [9%] in the comparator group).</p><p>7.18.5.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the toxicities reported with osimertinib were as expected for a TKI treatment, and that the trial’s secondary endpoints favoured osimertinib treatment.</p><p>7.18.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted that 65% of the comparator group received subsequent treatment, with substantial crossover in 47% of these patients receiving osimertinib second line. The Subcommittee considered that the difference in OS seen with osimertinib in the context of this extent of crossover supports the survival benefit of this treatment.</p><p>7.19.\tThe Subcommittee considered that first-line osimertinib uptake (compared to erlotinib or gefitinib) would be high and rapid among newly diagnosed EGFRm positive patients, in part due to the ASCO recommendation for its use as first-line treatment in this population. The Subcommittee considered that, based on current access to EGFR testing, approximately 200 patients per year might be eligible for first-line osimertinib treatment. The Subcommittee considered that, as testing becomes more accessible throughout New Zealand there is likely to be a gradual increase in the eligible patient numbers, with further increases once ctDNA testing becomes routinely available (potentially up to approximately 400 per year).</p><p>7.20.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if osimertinib were funded for first-line treatment of EGFRm positive NSCLC, current patients with stable disease on a first-generation TKI who are not experiencing dose-limiting toxicities would be unlikely to switch to osimertinib. The Subcommittee noted that there was sparse evidence to inform what potential benefit patients who received first-line osimertinib might receive from second-line treatment with first-generation TKIs in the event of disease progression.\xa0</p><p>7.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria proposed for first-line osimertinib in this setting, adjusted to align with currently funded TKI criteria and including ECOG rather than WHO performance status, would be appropriate to target funding.</p><p>Osimertinib in the second-line</p><p>7.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the application for osimertinib for the second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm T790M positive NSCLC targeted patients with stage IIIb or stage IV NSCLC who had progressed following treatment with an EGFR TKI.\xa0</p><p>7.23.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the key clinical evidence for osimertinib in the second-line for EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC comes from the phase III, open-label, randomised (2:1) international, AURA-3 trial which recruited 419 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed with previous EGFR TKI therapy and whose tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the EGFR gene. The Subcommittee noted that overall survival was a secondary outcome in AURA-3 and that the final overall survival analysis had now been published (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44).</p><p>7.23.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the cobas EGFR Mutation Test was used to confirm EGFRm and T790M mutation status after progression on a first-line EGFR TKI. The Subcommittee noted that participants were able to be enrolled if they had stable central nervous system metastasis and that there was a high proportion of Asian participants in the trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the trial population and comparator treatments were comparable to the New Zealand setting.</p><p>7.23.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that AURA-3 participants were randomised to receive either 80 mg osimertinib orally once daily or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 of body surface area plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5) or 75 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, with or without pemetrexed maintenance, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Subcommittee noted that cross over to osimertinib was permitted at disease progression for participants in the comparator group.\xa0</p><p>7.23.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome of AURA-3 was progression free survival (PFS);;CaTSoP had previously reviewed a publication from AURA-3 with PFS outcomes in April 2018 which reported a benefit with osimertinib across all subgroups (Mok et al. N Engl J Med 2017; 376:629-640). The Subcommittee considered this was good quality evidence of a PFS benefit.</p><p>7.24.\tThe Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint and that the final OS analysis of AURA-3 after data cut-off (March 2019) reported a median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 22.5 months with platinum-pemetrexed which was not statistically significant (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.12, P=0.277) (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44). The Subcommittee noted there was substantial crossover from platinum-pemetrexed to osimertinib (N=99; 73% of platinum-pemetrexed group) and considered that while this limited extrapolation of this data to the New Zealand setting, it suggests that osimertinib may be useful in either the second-line or third-line setting.</p><p>7.24.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the AURA-3 final analysis used a rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) to report an exploratory crossover-adjusted median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 15.9 months with platinum-pemetrexed (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.60). The Subcommittee noted the wide confidence interval which crossed one, however, members considered that the statistical analysis with this model supports a survival benefit of osimertinib compared with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy and highlights the effect of treatment crossover on the results of the non-adjusted OS analysis.\xa0</p><p>7.24.2.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the methods within the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) crossover-adjusted analysis were reasonable and appropriate, and that the results were applicable to the New Zealand context as no third-line EGFR TKIs are available following progression on platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy. However, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the confidence intervals were wide and that it was not possible to remove or account for all crossover effects. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for OS was of moderate quality.</p><p>7.25.\tThe Subcommittee noted the AURA-3 patient-reported outcomes which identified patients who received osimertinib had 15% better global health-related quality of life (QOL) (OR 2.11, CI 1.24 to 3.67, P=0.007) and increased time to deterioration for chest pain (HR, 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.73, P&lt;0.001) and dyspnoea (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.91, P=0.11) compared to the comparator (Lee et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1853-60). The Subcommittee noted that other metrics were not statistically significant but considered that there was a trend towards other improvements in QOL.</p><p>7.26.\tThe Subcommittee also noted the following publications:</p><p>•\tWu et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2702-9\xa0</p><p>•\tYang et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:538-47</p><p>•\tAkamatsu et al. Cancer Sci. 2018;109:1930-8</p><p>•\tPapadimitrakopoulou et al. Cancer. 2020;126:373-80</p><p>7.27.\tOverall, the Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of a PFS benefit with osimertinib second-line for EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, and that the post-hoc crossover-adjusted analysis supports an OS benefit in a comparable population.</p><p>7.28.\tThe Subcommittee noted that osimertinib offers suitability over systemic chemotherapy due to easier administration and reduced toxicities.\xa0\xa0</p><p>7.29.\tThe Subcommittee considered that most patients who discontinue first-line EGFR TKI treatment would be eligible for second-line treatment, therefore there would be a prevalent pool of patients with EGFR positive NSCLC that would be made up of approximately 150 patients currently on a 1st generation TKI, and approximately 75 patients who have previously discontinued due to prior disease progression. The Subcommittee considered that uptake would likely be rapid.\xa0</p><p>7.30.\tThe Subcommittee was made aware of a Canadian publication reporting participation in osimertinib clinical trials which reported that 97.5% of patients who progressed after first-line treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI had a biopsy at disease progression, with patients typically requiring an average of two biopsies (Chu et al. Curr Oncol. 2020;27:27-33). The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand, up to five biopsies may be attempted per patient and, based on the Canadian data, almost all of the approximately 150 New Zealand patients receiving an EGFR TKI per year would proceed to a biopsy post-disease progression, of which approximately 109 would have successful biopsies in the first instance.\xa0</p><p>7.31.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, based on extrapolation of the Canadian trial data, approximately 40-60% of New Zealand patients would test positive for T790M mutation after progression on a TKI (approximately 62 of 109 successfully biopsied patients) which is slightly less than what may be estimated from the AURA-3 trial data alone (from Supplementary appendix S2). The Subcommittee reiterated that implementation of ctDNA testing would increase the number of T790M mutations identified.\xa0</p><p>7.32.\tThe Subcommittee considered there was a long period of time between progression (occurring after about 10-12 months) and overall survival (about 20 to 30 months) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy, providing ample opportunity for repeat biopsies if needed for T790M mutation testing (Wang et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2012;4:19-29).\xa0</p><p>7.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a validated, accredited T790M mutation test is not available in New Zealand although there is variable access to T790M testing which may be added into testing performed at some centres. The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac could seek further advice from professional pathology societies in New Zealand such as the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) to understand testing in the New Zealand context independent of inter-centre variability. The Subcommittee considered that the number of patients who would seek access to funded treatments for T790M positive disease would increase if validated ctDNA testing were implemented and performed routinely in New Zealand.</p><p>7.34.\tThe Subcommittee considered that funding of osimertinib in the second-line would have additional health system impact for 12- to 18-months due to on-treatment monitoring (monthly clinic visits, three-monthly CT scans, and blood tests), and a small number of patients (approximately &lt;5%, or 3-4 patients per year) who would require hospital admission for management of grade 3-4 adverse events.</p><p>7.35.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would appropriately target osimertinib treatment to the population with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who would benefit in the second-line setting, including patients with central nervous system metastasis. The Subcommittee considered that further evaluation of these may be required if there were to be changes to the evidence regarding immune check point inhibitors in driver mutation NSCLC.\xa0</p><p>General\t</p><p>7.36.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there was evidence to support benefit from osimertinib in each of the first-line and second-line treatment settings, and supported funding osimertinib for a treatment line, either within first-line or second-line. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was not clinically appropriate for a patient to receive osimertinib in more than one treatment line.\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'fs': '<p>7.5.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the application for osimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm positive NSCLC was considered by PTAC in August 2020.

N Engl J Med. 2018;372:113-25).\xa0</p><p>7.18.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial population was limited to only a few possible EGFR mutations, was generally well balanced between treatment groups and considered that, although there was a greater proportion of Asian participants than the New Zealand population, the population appeared relevant to the New Zealand context.\xa0</p><p>7.18.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients received gefitinib in the comparator group (66%) compared to erlotinib, but considered the inverse to be true for New Zealand standard of care. Members considered, however, that the choice of first generation TKI was unlikely to make a difference in terms of subsequent eligible population, and considered the FLAURA trial comparators were comparable to standard of care.\xa0</p><p>7.18.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial reported an outcome of median PFS of 18.9 months with osimertinib compared to 10.2 months with the standard TKI comparator (hazard ratio [HR] for disease progression or death 0.46, 95%: CI 0.37-0.57, P&lt;0.001) and noted that this PFS benefit of osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs was statistically significant across all subgroups.</p><p>7.18.4.\tThe Subcommittee noted that an updated publication of the FLAURA trial reported median overall survival (OS) of 38.6 months in the osimertinib group compared with 31.8 months in the comparator arm (HR 0.80, 95.05% CI: 0.64-1.00; P=0.046) (Ramalingam et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:41-50). The Subcommittee considered that the data for up to three years of follow-up indicated a significant benefit in OS from osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs, noting that a number of patients remained on randomised first-line treatment at three years (78 [28%] in the osimertinib group and 26 [9%] in the comparator group).</p><p>7.18.5.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the toxicities reported with osimertinib were as expected for a TKI treatment, and that the trial’s secondary endpoints favoured osimertinib treatment.</p><p>7.18.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted that 65% of the comparator group received subsequent treatment, with substantial crossover in 47% of these patients receiving osimertinib second line. The Subcommittee considered that the difference in OS seen with osimertinib in the context of this extent of crossover supports the survival benefit of this treatment.</p><p>7.19.\tThe Subcommittee considered that first-line osimertinib uptake (compared to erlotinib or gefitinib) would be high and rapid among newly diagnosed EGFRm positive patients, in part due to the ASCO recommendation for its use as first-line treatment in this population. The Subcommittee considered that, based on current access to EGFR testing, approximately 200 patients per year might be eligible for first-line osimertinib treatment. The Subcommittee considered that, as testing becomes more accessible throughout New Zealand there is likely to be a gradual increase in the eligible patient numbers, with further increases once ctDNA testing becomes routinely available (potentially up to approximately 400 per year).</p><p>7.20.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if osimertinib were funded for first-line treatment of EGFRm positive NSCLC, current patients with stable disease on a first-generation TKI who are not experiencing dose-limiting toxicities would be unlikely to switch to osimertinib. The Subcommittee noted that there was sparse evidence to inform what potential benefit patients who received first-line osimertinib might receive from second-line treatment with first-generation TKIs in the event of disease progression.\xa0</p><p>7.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria proposed for first-line osimertinib in this setting, adjusted to align with currently funded TKI criteria and including ECOG rather than WHO performance status, would be appropriate to target funding.</p><p>Osimertinib in the second-line</p><p>7.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the application for osimertinib for the second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm T790M positive NSCLC targeted patients with stage IIIb or stage IV NSCLC who had progressed following treatment with an EGFR TKI.\xa0</p><p>7.23.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the key clinical evidence for osimertinib in the second-line for EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC comes from the phase III, open-label, randomised (2:1) international, AURA-3 trial which recruited 419 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed with previous EGFR TKI therapy and whose tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the EGFR gene. The Subcommittee noted that overall survival was a secondary outcome in AURA-3 and that the final overall survival analysis had now been published (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44).</p><p>7.23.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the cobas EGFR Mutation Test was used to confirm EGFRm and T790M mutation status after progression on a first-line EGFR TKI. The Subcommittee noted that participants were able to be enrolled if they had stable central nervous system metastasis and that there was a high proportion of Asian participants in the trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the trial population and comparator treatments were comparable to the New Zealand setting.</p><p>7.23.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that AURA-3 participants were randomised to receive either 80 mg osimertinib orally once daily or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 of body surface area plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5) or 75 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, with or without pemetrexed maintenance, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Subcommittee noted that cross over to osimertinib was permitted at disease progression for participants in the comparator group.\xa0</p><p>7.23.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome of AURA-3 was progression free survival (PFS);;CaTSoP had previously reviewed a publication from AURA-3 with PFS outcomes in April 2018 which reported a benefit with osimertinib across all subgroups (Mok et al. N Engl J Med 2017; 376:629-640). The Subcommittee considered this was good quality evidence of a PFS benefit.</p><p>7.24.\tThe Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint and that the final OS analysis of AURA-3 after data cut-off (March 2019) reported a median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 22.5 months with platinum-pemetrexed which was not statistically significant (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.12, P=0.277) (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44). The Subcommittee noted there was substantial crossover from platinum-pemetrexed to osimertinib (N=99; 73% of platinum-pemetrexed group) and considered that while this limited extrapolation of this data to the New Zealand setting, it suggests that osimertinib may be useful in either the second-line or third-line setting.</p><p>7.24.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the AURA-3 final analysis used a rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) to report an exploratory crossover-adjusted median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 15.9 months with platinum-pemetrexed (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.60). The Subcommittee noted the wide confidence interval which crossed one, however, members considered that the statistical analysis with this model supports a survival benefit of osimertinib compared with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy and highlights the effect of treatment crossover on the results of the non-adjusted OS analysis.\xa0</p><p>7.24.2.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the methods within the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) crossover-adjusted analysis were reasonable and appropriate, and that the results were applicable to the New Zealand context as no third-line EGFR TKIs are available following progression on platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy. However, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the confidence intervals were wide and that it was not possible to remove or account for all crossover effects. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for OS was of moderate quality.</p><p>7.25.\tThe Subcommittee noted the AURA-3 patient-reported outcomes which identified patients who received osimertinib had 15% better global health-related quality of life (QOL) (OR 2.11, CI 1.24 to 3.67, P=0.007) and increased time to deterioration for chest pain (HR, 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.73, P&lt;0.001) and dyspnoea (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.91, P=0.11) compared to the comparator (Lee et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1853-60). The Subcommittee noted that other metrics were not statistically significant but considered that there was a trend towards other improvements in QOL.</p><p>7.26.\tThe Subcommittee also noted the following publications:</p><p>•\tWu et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2702-9\xa0</p><p>•\tYang et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:538-47</p><p>•\tAkamatsu et al. Cancer Sci. 2018;109:1930-8</p><p>•\tPapadimitrakopoulou et al. Cancer. 2020;126:373-80</p><p>7.27.\tOverall, the Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of a PFS benefit with osimertinib second-line for EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, and that the post-hoc crossover-adjusted analysis supports an OS benefit in a comparable population.</p><p>7.28.\tThe Subcommittee noted that osimertinib offers suitability over systemic chemotherapy due to easier administration and reduced toxicities.\xa0\xa0</p><p>7.29.\tThe Subcommittee considered that most patients who discontinue first-line EGFR TKI treatment would be eligible for second-line treatment, therefore there would be a prevalent pool of patients with EGFR positive NSCLC that would be made up of approximately 150 patients currently on a 1st generation TKI, and approximately 75 patients who have previously discontinued due to prior disease progression. The Subcommittee considered that uptake would likely be rapid.\xa0</p><p>7.30.\tThe Subcommittee was made aware of a Canadian publication reporting participation in osimertinib clinical trials which reported that 97.5% of patients who progressed after first-line treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI had a biopsy at disease progression, with patients typically requiring an average of two biopsies (Chu et al. Curr Oncol. 2020;27:27-33). The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand, up to five biopsies may be attempted per patient and, based on the Canadian data, almost all of the approximately 150 New Zealand patients receiving an EGFR TKI per year would proceed to a biopsy post-disease progression, of which approximately 109 would have successful biopsies in the first instance.\xa0</p><p>7.31.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, based on extrapolation of the Canadian trial data, approximately 40-60% of New Zealand patients would test positive for T790M mutation after progression on a TKI (approximately 62 of 109 successfully biopsied patients) which is slightly less than what may be estimated from the AURA-3 trial data alone (from Supplementary appendix S2). The Subcommittee reiterated that implementation of ctDNA testing would increase the number of T790M mutations identified.\xa0</p><p>7.32.\tThe Subcommittee considered there was a long period of time between progression (occurring after about 10-12 months) and overall survival (about 20 to 30 months) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy, providing ample opportunity for repeat biopsies if needed for T790M mutation testing (Wang et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2012;4:19-29).\xa0</p><p>7.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a validated, accredited T790M mutation test is not available in New Zealand although there is variable access to T790M testing which may be added into testing performed at some centres. The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac could seek further advice from professional pathology societies in New Zealand such as the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) to understand testing in the New Zealand context independent of inter-centre variability. The Subcommittee considered that the number of patients who would seek access to funded treatments for T790M positive disease would increase if validated ctDNA testing were implemented and performed routinely in New Zealand.</p><p>7.34.\tThe Subcommittee considered that funding of osimertinib in the second-line would have additional health system impact for 12- to 18-months due to on-treatment monitoring (monthly clinic visits, three-monthly CT scans, and blood tests), and a small number of patients (approximately &lt;5%, or 3-4 patients per year) who would require hospital admission for management of grade 3-4 adverse events.</p><p>7.35.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would appropriately target osimertinib treatment to the population with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who would benefit in the second-line setting, including patients with central nervous system metastasis. The Subcommittee considered that further evaluation of these may be required if there were to be changes to the evidence regarding immune check point inhibitors in driver mutation NSCLC.\xa0</p><p>General\t</p><p>7.36.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there was evidence to support benefit from osimertinib in each of the first-line and second-line treatment settings, and supported funding osimertinib for a treatment line, either within first-line or second-line. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was not clinically appropriate for a patient to receive osimertinib in more than one treatment line.\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': '<p>7.1.\tThe Subcommittee considered the following applications:</p><p>7.1.1.\tOsimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation (EGFRm) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), following review of this application by PTAC; and</p><p>7.1.2.\tOsimertinib for the second-line treatment of EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC after prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, in light of updated evidence from the AURA-3 trial’s final overall survival analysis.</p><p><br></p>', 'fs': '<p>7.1.\tThe Subcommittee considered the following applications:</p><p>7.1.1.\tOsimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation (EGFRm) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), following review of this application by PTAC; and</p><p>7.1.2.\tOsimertinib for the second-line treatment of EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC after prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, in light of updated evidence from the AURA-3 trial’s final overall survival analysis.</p><p><br></p>', 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': 'High', 'fs': 'High', 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Aug 2021', 'fs': 'Aug 2021', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'fs': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000R5LPZ2A3'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000R5LPZ2A3', 'Event_Date__c': '2021-08-03', 'Event_Description__c': 'Clinical advice received from Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) at meeting Monday 12 April 2021.', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Outcome__c': 'High', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Aug 2021', 'Published_Recommendation__c': '<p>7.2.\tThe Subcommittee recommended that the application for osimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFRm) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) be funded with a high priority, in the context of treatment of malignancy, subject to the following Special Authority criteria:\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>OSIMERTINIB</p><p>Special Authority for Subsidy – Retail Pharmacy - Specialist</p><p>Initial application – (NSCLC – first line) only from a relevant specialist or any other medical practitioner on the recommendation of a relevant specialist.

At that time, PTAC recommended it be funded if cost-neutral to current first-line TKI’s, erlotinib and/or gefitinib, due to:</p><p>•\tThe high health need of people with lung cancer and the current availability of two effective agents in the same class funded for this indication; and</p><p>•\tThe high quality, randomised-control trial evidence that reported benefit in progression free survival compared with the comparator (gefitinib or erlotinib); and\xa0</p><p>•\tThe uncertain evidence regarding benefit in overall survival compared with the comparator (erlotinib or gefitinib); and</p><p>•\tThe lack of evidence of superiority of osimertinib to the current two first-line pharmaceuticals for this indication.</p><p>7.5.1.\tAt that time, PTAC considered that Pharmac could seek advice from CaTSoP regarding the sequence of treatments in this indication, and appropriate Special Authority criteria for osimertinib in the first-line setting.</p><p>7.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the application for osimertinib for second-line treatment of EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC after prior EGFR TKI therapy was received in November 2017 and was considered by CaTSoP in April 2018 with a recommendation to defer pending publication of longer-term follow-up data including mature survival data from the AURA-3 clinical trial.</p><p>7.6.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that Pharmac received correspondence from the supplier, AstraZeneca, and from clinicians regarding osimertinib, which was subsequently considered by CaTSoP in September 2018 and reiterated that publication of longer-term mature survival data (including AURA-3 trial data) was awaited.</p><p>7.6.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that updated AURA-3 study materials provided by the supplier in June 2020 were considered by PTAC in August 2020, where it was recommended that the application be deferred pending publication and peer-review of AURA-3 overall survival results.</p><p>7.6.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that in early 2021, a peer-reviewed publication of overall survival outcomes from the AURA-3 trial and two other publications from the trial were made available warranting further consideration of the application.\xa0</p><p>Discussion</p><p>7.7.\tPTAC and PTAC Subcommittees may differ in the advice they provide to Pharmac, including recommendations’ priority, due to the committees’ different, albeit complementary, roles, expertise, experience, and perspectives.</p><p>7.8.\tThe Subcommittee noted that 90% of lung cancers diagnosed in New Zealand are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and that EGFRm positive disease has been estimated to occur in about 20% of NSCLC, equivalent to 91 new registrations in Māori and 337 in non-Māori based on 2018 data (Ministry of Health, 2018). The Subcommittee considered the health need of patients with NSCLC is well documented in previous CaTSoP and PTAC records and that the content of those records remains accurate in this regard.\xa0</p><p>7.9.\tThe Subcommittee noted that international treatment guidelines recommend molecular testing for all patients with metastatic non-squamous lung cancer to identify potential therapeutic targets. The Subcommittee noted that approximately 65% of New Zealand patients with NSCLC received EGFR mutation testing in 2014 leading to an estimated prevalence of EGFRm positive disease of approximately 15.5% if all patients with NSCLC were tested (Tin Tin et al. Cancer Epidemiol. 2018;57:24-32).\xa0</p><p>7.10.\tThe Subcommittee noted that mutation testing currently uses tumour tissue based samples, however, members considered that about 15-25% of patients may not be physically able to undergo the\xa0biopsy procedure required. The Subcommittee noted that liquid (blood) based testing is currently undertaken internationally and within some New Zealand centres, using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) typically via either private funding or as part of a clinical trial. The Subcommittee noted that some laboratories are developing their own assays, however, access to biopsies and testing is variable.\xa0\xa0</p><p>7.11.\tThe Subcommittee considered the capability to undertake ctDNA testing consistently throughout New Zealand without the requirement for tissue biopsy would enable a greater number of patients to be tested for EGFR mutations. Members considered that ctDNA testing is likely to be introduced within the next five years and that there would be further evolution of mutation testing in New Zealand to track changes over time. The Subcommittee reiterated its suggestion for Pharmac to engage with laboratory representatives, noting the range of potential EGFR mutations and resistance mechanisms, with complexity and testing likely to increase over time.</p><p>7.12.\tThe Subcommittee noted that people with EGFRm positive NSCLC currently receive first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib, followed by second and third-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 60-80% of patients with EGFRm positive NSCLC respond to first-line treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib (time to progression of between 9.2 to 13.1 months based on Wang et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2012;4:19-29), and approximately 40-60% of these patients will develop T790M mutation (based on Hata et al. Cancer. 2013;119:4325-32 and Chai et al. Cancer Manag Res. 2020;12:5439-50), signalling disease progression and acquired treatment resistance. The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no funded treatment to specifically target T790M mutation positive disease.</p><p>7.13.\tThe Subcommittee considered the target EGFRm positive NSCLC population is mutually exclusive to the PD-L1 positive population with NSCLC and funding a new agent in this population would be unlikely to impact the broader funded treatment paradigm for NSCLC. The Subcommittee considered that there is evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitors are not as effective in patients with driver mutations, although the evidence for checkpoint inhibitors and driver mutation targeting agents is evolving.</p><p>7.14.\tThe Subcommittee noted that osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been investigated for EGFRm positive NSCLC in the phase III FLAURA (first-line osimertinib vs gefitinib or erlotinib) and AURA-3 (second-line osimertinib vs pemetrexed with carboplatin/cisplatin in T790M mutation positive disease) clinical trials. The Subcommittee noted that other third generation TKIs have been unsuccessful in trials therefore osimertinib was the only third generation TKI currently available.\xa0</p><p>7.15.\tThe Subcommittee was made aware of evidence that, similar to first-generation TKIs, patients inevitably develop resistance to osimertinib either in the first- or second-line setting and considered that this may lead to resistance mechanisms that would either enable subsequent treatment options (eg first-generation TKIs, erlotinib and/or gefitinib) to be effective or render them ineffective (Leonetti et al. Br J Cancer. 2019; 121: 725–37). The Subcommittee considered it was unclear what the impact of these cross-resistant mechanisms would be on usage of erlotinib or gefitinib in the second line.\xa0</p><p>7.16.\tThe Subcommittee noted that funding agencies in Australia (PBAC), England and Wales (NICE) and Canada (CADTH) have recommended osimertinib be funded in both the first- and second-line settings; however, osimertinib is recommended only as a second line treatment for patients with EGFRm T790M positive NSCLC by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). The Subcommittee also noted that osimertinib is recommended only as a first-line treatment for EGFRm positive NSCLC by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (Hanna et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:1040-91).</p><p>Osimertinib in the first-line</p><p>7.17.\tThe Subcommittee noted the application for osimertinib for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm positive NSCLC targeted patients with stage IIIb or stage IV NSCLC who were treatment-naïve or had discontinued treatment with erlotinib/gefitinib due to intolerance (not progression), and who had WHO performance status of two or less.\xa0</p><p>7.18.\tThe Subcommittee noted the key evidence for osimertinib in this setting comes from the phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1) controlled FLAURA trial of osimertinib (80 mg once daily) compared with gefitinib (250 mg once daily) or erlotinib (150 mg once daily) in 556 treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm positive NSCLC (Soria et al. N Engl J Med. 2018;372:113-25).\xa0</p><p>7.18.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial population was limited to only a few possible EGFR mutations, was generally well balanced between treatment groups and considered that, although there was a greater proportion of Asian participants than the New Zealand population, the population appeared relevant to the New Zealand context.\xa0</p><p>7.18.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients received gefitinib in the comparator group (66%) compared to erlotinib, but considered the inverse to be true for New Zealand standard of care. Members considered, however, that the choice of first generation TKI was unlikely to make a difference in terms of subsequent eligible population, and considered the FLAURA trial comparators were comparable to standard of care.\xa0</p><p>7.18.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the FLAURA trial reported an outcome of median PFS of 18.9 months with osimertinib compared to 10.2 months with the standard TKI comparator (hazard ratio [HR] for disease progression or death 0.46, 95%: CI 0.37-0.57, P&lt;0.001) and noted that this PFS benefit of osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs was statistically significant across all subgroups.</p><p>7.18.4.\tThe Subcommittee noted that an updated publication of the FLAURA trial reported median overall survival (OS) of 38.6 months in the osimertinib group compared with 31.8 months in the comparator arm (HR 0.80, 95.05% CI: 0.64-1.00; P=0.046) (Ramalingam et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:41-50). The Subcommittee considered that the data for up to three years of follow-up indicated a significant benefit in OS from osimertinib compared to first-generation TKIs, noting that a number of patients remained on randomised first-line treatment at three years (78 [28%] in the osimertinib group and 26 [9%] in the comparator group).</p><p>7.18.5.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the toxicities reported with osimertinib were as expected for a TKI treatment, and that the trial’s secondary endpoints favoured osimertinib treatment.</p><p>7.18.6.\tThe Subcommittee noted that 65% of the comparator group received subsequent treatment, with substantial crossover in 47% of these patients receiving osimertinib second line. The Subcommittee considered that the difference in OS seen with osimertinib in the context of this extent of crossover supports the survival benefit of this treatment.</p><p>7.19.\tThe Subcommittee considered that first-line osimertinib uptake (compared to erlotinib or gefitinib) would be high and rapid among newly diagnosed EGFRm positive patients, in part due to the ASCO recommendation for its use as first-line treatment in this population. The Subcommittee considered that, based on current access to EGFR testing, approximately 200 patients per year might be eligible for first-line osimertinib treatment. The Subcommittee considered that, as testing becomes more accessible throughout New Zealand there is likely to be a gradual increase in the eligible patient numbers, with further increases once ctDNA testing becomes routinely available (potentially up to approximately 400 per year).</p><p>7.20.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, if osimertinib were funded for first-line treatment of EGFRm positive NSCLC, current patients with stable disease on a first-generation TKI who are not experiencing dose-limiting toxicities would be unlikely to switch to osimertinib. The Subcommittee noted that there was sparse evidence to inform what potential benefit patients who received first-line osimertinib might receive from second-line treatment with first-generation TKIs in the event of disease progression.\xa0</p><p>7.21.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria proposed for first-line osimertinib in this setting, adjusted to align with currently funded TKI criteria and including ECOG rather than WHO performance status, would be appropriate to target funding.</p><p>Osimertinib in the second-line</p><p>7.22.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the application for osimertinib for the second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm T790M positive NSCLC targeted patients with stage IIIb or stage IV NSCLC who had progressed following treatment with an EGFR TKI.\xa0</p><p>7.23.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the key clinical evidence for osimertinib in the second-line for EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC comes from the phase III, open-label, randomised (2:1) international, AURA-3 trial which recruited 419 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed with previous EGFR TKI therapy and whose tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the EGFR gene. The Subcommittee noted that overall survival was a secondary outcome in AURA-3 and that the final overall survival analysis had now been published (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44).</p><p>7.23.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the cobas EGFR Mutation Test was used to confirm EGFRm and T790M mutation status after progression on a first-line EGFR TKI. The Subcommittee noted that participants were able to be enrolled if they had stable central nervous system metastasis and that there was a high proportion of Asian participants in the trial. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the trial population and comparator treatments were comparable to the New Zealand setting.</p><p>7.23.2.\tThe Subcommittee noted that AURA-3 participants were randomised to receive either 80 mg osimertinib orally once daily or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 of body surface area plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5) or 75 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, with or without pemetrexed maintenance, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Subcommittee noted that cross over to osimertinib was permitted at disease progression for participants in the comparator group.\xa0</p><p>7.23.3.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the primary outcome of AURA-3 was progression free survival (PFS);;CaTSoP had previously reviewed a publication from AURA-3 with PFS outcomes in April 2018 which reported a benefit with osimertinib across all subgroups (Mok et al. N Engl J Med 2017; 376:629-640). The Subcommittee considered this was good quality evidence of a PFS benefit.</p><p>7.24.\tThe Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint and that the final OS analysis of AURA-3 after data cut-off (March 2019) reported a median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 22.5 months with platinum-pemetrexed which was not statistically significant (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.12, P=0.277) (Papadimitrakopoulou et al. Ann Oncol. 2020;31:1536-44). The Subcommittee noted there was substantial crossover from platinum-pemetrexed to osimertinib (N=99; 73% of platinum-pemetrexed group) and considered that while this limited extrapolation of this data to the New Zealand setting, it suggests that osimertinib may be useful in either the second-line or third-line setting.</p><p>7.24.1.\tThe Subcommittee noted that the AURA-3 final analysis used a rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) to report an exploratory crossover-adjusted median OS of 26.8 months with osimertinib vs 15.9 months with platinum-pemetrexed (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.60). The Subcommittee noted the wide confidence interval which crossed one, however, members considered that the statistical analysis with this model supports a survival benefit of osimertinib compared with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy and highlights the effect of treatment crossover on the results of the non-adjusted OS analysis.\xa0</p><p>7.24.2.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the methods within the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) crossover-adjusted analysis were reasonable and appropriate, and that the results were applicable to the New Zealand context as no third-line EGFR TKIs are available following progression on platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy. However, the Subcommittee acknowledged that the confidence intervals were wide and that it was not possible to remove or account for all crossover effects. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for OS was of moderate quality.</p><p>7.25.\tThe Subcommittee noted the AURA-3 patient-reported outcomes which identified patients who received osimertinib had 15% better global health-related quality of life (QOL) (OR 2.11, CI 1.24 to 3.67, P=0.007) and increased time to deterioration for chest pain (HR, 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.73, P&lt;0.001) and dyspnoea (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.91, P=0.11) compared to the comparator (Lee et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1853-60). The Subcommittee noted that other metrics were not statistically significant but considered that there was a trend towards other improvements in QOL.</p><p>7.26.\tThe Subcommittee also noted the following publications:</p><p>•\tWu et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2702-9\xa0</p><p>•\tYang et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:538-47</p><p>•\tAkamatsu et al. Cancer Sci. 2018;109:1930-8</p><p>•\tPapadimitrakopoulou et al. Cancer. 2020;126:373-80</p><p>7.27.\tOverall, the Subcommittee considered that there is evidence of a PFS benefit with osimertinib second-line for EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, and that the post-hoc crossover-adjusted analysis supports an OS benefit in a comparable population.</p><p>7.28.\tThe Subcommittee noted that osimertinib offers suitability over systemic chemotherapy due to easier administration and reduced toxicities.\xa0\xa0</p><p>7.29.\tThe Subcommittee considered that most patients who discontinue first-line EGFR TKI treatment would be eligible for second-line treatment, therefore there would be a prevalent pool of patients with EGFR positive NSCLC that would be made up of approximately 150 patients currently on a 1st generation TKI, and approximately 75 patients who have previously discontinued due to prior disease progression. The Subcommittee considered that uptake would likely be rapid.\xa0</p><p>7.30.\tThe Subcommittee was made aware of a Canadian publication reporting participation in osimertinib clinical trials which reported that 97.5% of patients who progressed after first-line treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI had a biopsy at disease progression, with patients typically requiring an average of two biopsies (Chu et al. Curr Oncol. 2020;27:27-33). The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand, up to five biopsies may be attempted per patient and, based on the Canadian data, almost all of the approximately 150 New Zealand patients receiving an EGFR TKI per year would proceed to a biopsy post-disease progression, of which approximately 109 would have successful biopsies in the first instance.\xa0</p><p>7.31.\tThe Subcommittee considered that, based on extrapolation of the Canadian trial data, approximately 40-60% of New Zealand patients would test positive for T790M mutation after progression on a TKI (approximately 62 of 109 successfully biopsied patients) which is slightly less than what may be estimated from the AURA-3 trial data alone (from Supplementary appendix S2). The Subcommittee reiterated that implementation of ctDNA testing would increase the number of T790M mutations identified.\xa0</p><p>7.32.\tThe Subcommittee considered there was a long period of time between progression (occurring after about 10-12 months) and overall survival (about 20 to 30 months) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy, providing ample opportunity for repeat biopsies if needed for T790M mutation testing (Wang et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2012;4:19-29).\xa0</p><p>7.33.\tThe Subcommittee noted that a validated, accredited T790M mutation test is not available in New Zealand although there is variable access to T790M testing which may be added into testing performed at some centres. The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac could seek further advice from professional pathology societies in New Zealand such as the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) to understand testing in the New Zealand context independent of inter-centre variability. The Subcommittee considered that the number of patients who would seek access to funded treatments for T790M positive disease would increase if validated ctDNA testing were implemented and performed routinely in New Zealand.</p><p>7.34.\tThe Subcommittee considered that funding of osimertinib in the second-line would have additional health system impact for 12- to 18-months due to on-treatment monitoring (monthly clinic visits, three-monthly CT scans, and blood tests), and a small number of patients (approximately &lt;5%, or 3-4 patients per year) who would require hospital admission for management of grade 3-4 adverse events.</p><p>7.35.\tThe Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would appropriately target osimertinib treatment to the population with EGFR T790M mutation positive disease who would benefit in the second-line setting, including patients with central nervous system metastasis. The Subcommittee considered that further evaluation of these may be required if there were to be changes to the evidence regarding immune check point inhibitors in driver mutation NSCLC.\xa0</p><p>General\t</p><p>7.36.\tThe Subcommittee considered that there was evidence to support benefit from osimertinib in each of the first-line and second-line treatment settings, and supported funding osimertinib for a treatment line, either within first-line or second-line. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was not clinically appropriate for a patient to receive osimertinib in more than one treatment line.\xa0</p><p><br></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000D4K0QAK'}, 'change': None}]",Mar 2018,False,True
