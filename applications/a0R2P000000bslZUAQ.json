The Committee noted that the supplier estimated a health sector saving could be achieved if paliperidone three-monthly were funded, primarily due to a reduction in hospitalisations. The Committee considered that any reduction in hospitalisations would be a meaningful benefit with current resource constraints (eg. hospital staffing, specialist availability); however, Members cautioned modelling any potential cost savings from reduced hospitalisations due to the relatively low quality of this evidence and the uncertainty of applicability to New Zealand.\u00a0</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that overall, the evidence provided in the resubmission was of weak to moderate quality and strength. Members considered that the qualitative data were important and that it aligned with positive clinician views regarding paliperidone three-monthly. Members noted that the vast majority of the evidence included in the resubmission was authored by individuals with substantial conflicts of interest. Members did not discuss the possible impacts of these conflicts on the evidence provided.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Members considered that the benefits which could occur from the funding of paliperidone three-monthly (eg. reduction in relapses, improved adherence) would be experienced by those most disadvantaged and that as such this proposal may have a positive influence on improving inequities currently observed with schizophrenia. Members also noted that the benefits to carers highlighted by Lencer et al. would meet the wider health need of the wh\u0101nau and support M\u0101ori health outcomes.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the resubmission included Australian data, which showed the market share of antipsychotic depots before and after the funding of paliperidone three-monthly. The Committee noted that in Australia, no large shifts in paliperidone use were observed. The Committee noted that aripiprazole depot is funded and holds a large market share in Australia, but it is not currently funded in New Zealand. Members considered that as aripiprazole depot is not currently funded in New Zealand, the presented market share data have low relevance to what may occur in New Zealand if paliperidone three-monthly were funded. The Committee considered, in the absence of aripiprazole depot funding, that if paliperidone three-monthly were funded, it was likely that a shift to paliperidone from other antipsychotic depots and oral antipsychotics would occur. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 14px;\">The Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for paliperidone three-monthly if it were to be funded in New Zealand for schizophrenia. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000006qXIg&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P0000025ZZ6\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
