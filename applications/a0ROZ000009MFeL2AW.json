The Committee noted that retreatment is currently through an open labelled study being conducted at the New Zealand Liver Transplant Unit (NZLTU), Auckland City Hospital. To date, 65 people who have not cleared Hepatis C infection after receiving Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) treatment (mainly Maviret) have received sofosbuvir plus glecaprevir with pibrentasvir (Maviret) for 16 weeks with all but one being cleared of infection.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee <strong>recommended</strong> that a combination retreatment regime of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (Vosevi) or sofosbuvir plus glecaprevir with pibrentasvir (Maviret) be funded for this group. The Committee noted that of the two options, Vosevi was simpler to administer in the community due to one single tablet per day and a shorter treatment period (12 vs 16 weeks). However, in Maviret failures, sofosbuvir plus Maviret was more effective and did not require addition of ribavirin. The Committee noted that sofosbuvir plus Maviret was the preferred treatment option for these reasons.\u00a0</p>",
          "Published_Application__c": "<p>1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is a submission before the Medicines Classification Council (MCC) to allow nurses who are experienced with Hepatitis C (HepC) treatment to prescribe glecaprevir with pibrentasvir (Maviret).</p><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee reviewed the available treatments for HepC infection and considered that glecaprevir with pibrentasvir remained the appropriate first line treatment in the majority of cases, with some exceptions.</p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee identified two groups of people who could not be treated with glecaprevir with pibrentasvir and for whom there was currently no funded alternatives. Members reiterated their recommendations (from email correspondence earlier in 2022) pertaining to the management of each group as follows:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">3.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Individuals with decompensated cirrhosis from Hepatitis C. Currently, sofosbuvir with ledipasvir (Harvoni) is funded but is ineffective in people infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 (approximately half all cases in New Zealand); and individuals with Hepatitis C infection who have experienced treatment failure with Maviret or previous first line treatments.</p>",
          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the manufacturer of Ibavyr (ribavirin 200mg tablets) has indicated they intend to discontinue production in the future. The Committee noted that glecaprevir with pibrentasvir was not suitable for treating people with liver failure due to containing a protease inhibitor and that while alternative treatments existed, including ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa), that the alternatives had significantly longer treatment periods and lower efficacy.</p><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the preferred treatment for people with HepC infection and liver failure was Epclusa plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Members noted that ribavirin was also used for treatment of other viral infections including those with epidemic potential such as measles, which could potentially require access to larger stocks than usual use. </p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at present ribavirin was not listed on the HML and that access was via a special programme run by Pharmac. The Committee considered that HML listing was preferable to a special access pathway.</p><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that access to ribavirin stocks should be secured and that there was a high need to maintain continuity of supply for this medicine for treatment of both Hepatitis C and other viral infections.</p>",
