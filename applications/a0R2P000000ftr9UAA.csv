The Committee considered the benefit of del-Nido solution to be a reduction in the frequency of re-infusion of the cardioplegia and a decrease in cross-clamp time. The Committee considered that outcomes such as reductions in postoperative, atrial fibrillation, renal failure or low left ventricular ejection fraction did not have a strong association with decreased cross-clamp time, although noting evidence that cross-clamp time under 150 minutes may be associated with a lower risk of postoperative events (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007817/"" target=""_blank"">Nissinen et al. Perfusion 24 (5): 297-305</a>). </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the wash out period required for del-Nido solution would be longer than shorter acting cardioplegia. The Committee considered that duration of effect is a factor in the selection of cardioplegia solution and depends on the pathology and nature of the surgery as the complexity affects the ability of the solution to reach the target areas in the heart. The Committee considered that such factors would be considered by the clinicians involved in the procedure to make an appropriate choice for the individual they are treating. </p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current stability of the extemporaneous product was one month stored at 2-8 ⁰C. The Committee noted that the application was for del-Nido solution produced by Biomed with a 6-month expiry and able to be stored at room temperature. The Committee noted that this was not a Medsafe approved product and if funded would be supplied under Section 29. The Committee considered that previous recommendations for other therapeutics were subject to Medsafe approval however, considered that manufacturers of product are unlikely to seek Medsafe approval. The Committee considered the risk of using an unregistered product to be low for those likely to be using this product.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that it has been difficult for hospitals to predict the amount of del-Nido solution stock that might be required over the past few years as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted surgical operating times. The Committee considered a longer expiry could help mitigate this issue. The Committee considered there would be less waste, reduced time needed for compounding and easier storage with the 6-month expiry product. The Committee considered that this solved a Te Whatu Ora infrastructure problem addressing both storage and time needed to compound issues. </p><h2><strong>Cost and savings</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that an additional 10 minutes per hour of direct surgery time was saved using del-Nido (long acting) cardioplegia but considered that total time in theatre is impacted by many additional factors (preparation time, anaesthesia time, surgical team availability, blood testing delays, equipment function etc) and the impact of use of del-Nido solution on total theatre time is likely to be minimal. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of del-Nido cardioplegia with longer duration storage time would largely be confined to a subset of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, mainly in the Auckland and Waikato Te Whatu Ora districts. The Committee considered solution availability and familiarity could result in more widespread use over time. The Committee considered that del-Nido cardioplegia is not currently used for paediatric or adult congenital cardiac surgery, and current use was mainly in the adult non-congenital cardiac surgical setting. The Committee considered that del-Nido cardioplegia would be an additional option to the currently available cardioplegia solutions and may not be the preferred cardioplegia in all Te Whatu Ora districts. </p><h2><strong>Summary for assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for Biomed’s del-Nido solution if it were to be funded in New Zealand for induction of cardiac stasis during cardiac surgery. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
