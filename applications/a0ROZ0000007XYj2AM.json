The Committee considered that TB poses a great public health risk of spread if the index case is not adequately treated, as one person with active TB can infect more than one in four of their close contacts.</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that MDR-TB is defined as resistant to two essential first-line tuberculosis treatments as prescribed by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/guidelines-tuberculosis-control-new-zealand-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health (MOH) tuberculosis guidelines</a>\u00a0(sourced from the World Health Organization [WHO]), isoniazid and rifampicin. The Committee noted MDR-TB has a high mortality rate of 40%, and that 5% of all cases of tuberculosis are classed as MDR-TB but they account for about a third of the total healthcare cost of tuberculosis.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the treatment regimen from the latest guidelines from the WHO published in 2019 (<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311389/9789241550529-eng.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">WHO consolidated guidelines on drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment</a>) comprising of three Group A agents, a fluoroquinolone (either levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), bedaquiline and linezolid, and two Group B agents, clofazimine and cycloserine. The Committee noted that Group C agents should only be used in place of Group A or B agents if they are contraindicated.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bedaquiline 100 mg tablet had been approved by\u00a0<a href=\"https://medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/ProductDetail.asp?ID=17632\" target=\"_blank\">Medsafe</a>\u00a0in 2016. The Committee noted that bedaquiline is indicated in adults (&gt;18 years) as part of a combination therapy of MDR-TB. The Committee also noted the approved dosing regimen of 400 mg (four tablets) once daily for two weeks, then 200 mg (two tablets) three times per week with at least 48 hours between doses.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the duration of treatment for bedaquiline as a period of 24 weeks. The Committee noted the advice to discontinue bedaquiline four to five months prior to discontinuing other drugs in the treatment regimen, as bedaquiline has a terminal half-life of four to five months which risks antimicrobial resistance to bedaquiline developing if other agents are taken for insufficient time after stopping bedaquiline.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a funding application for bedaquiline for the treatment of MDR-TB has been considered by PHARMAC previously. The Committee noted that the Rare Disorders Subcommittee considered the application at its November 2014 meeting and recommended that the Anti-Infective Subcommittee be asked for clinical advice regarding appropriate restrictions on the use of bedaquiline and whether there would be any safety concerns with listing bedaquiline. The Committee noted that the Anti-Infective Subcommittee recommended bedaquiline be funded with a high priority for the treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health MDR-TB Committee at its December 2014 meeting. The Committee noted that both the Anti-Infective Subcommittee and the Rare Disorders Subcommittee noted the unexplained increased mortality in the bedaquiline group in the phase-II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial by Diacon et al (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140958\" target=\"_blank\">N Eng J Med. 2014;371:723-32</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously reviewed and accepted the minutes from the respective PTAC Subcommittees (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2015-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC February 2015 minutes</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2015-05-updated.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC May 2015 minutes</a>).\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the latest\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311389/9789241550529-eng.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">WHO guidelines</a>, which incorporate a meta-analysis of 13,104 patient level data records from 53 studies in 40 countries investigating bedaquiline in MDR-TB. The Committee noted the rate of treatment failure was lower in patients receiving bedaquiline (11.6%) compared with those who did not (48.8%). The Committee noted that treatment failure would require further treatment with other toxic medications and result in patient seclusion/isolation for longer duration of time, especially in regions without infection control isolation facilities with adequate negative pressure etc. The Committee noted that fewer deaths were observed with those taking bedaquiline (15%) when compared with those not taking bedaquiline (22.8%).</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a phase-II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial with 208 participants to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of bedaquiline as part of a combination therapy of MDR-TB (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140958\" target=\"_blank\">Diacon et al, N Eng J Med. 2014;371:723-32</a>). The Committee noted the reduction in the median time to culture conversion in the bedaquiline group (83 days) compared with the placebo group (125 days). The Committee also noted the higher rates of cure observed in the bedaquiline group (58%) compared with placebo group (32%).</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a phase-II, multicentre, open label, single arm study with 241 participants to evaluate the efficacy of bedaquiline as part of an individualised MDR-TB treatment regimen (<a href=\"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/47/2/564.long\" target=\"_blank\">Pym et al, Eur Respir J. 2016;47(2):564-74</a>). The Committee noted the proportion of patients in the bedaquiline group with confirmed culture conversion at weeks 24 in C209 (79.5%) was similar to that of C208 (72.2%). The Committee also noted the higher rates of cure observed in the bedaquiline group (61%) compared with the placebo group (57.6%). The Committee noted that none of the deaths observed in the bedaquiline group appeared directly related to bedaquiline; reported causes of death included tuberculosis-related illness, haemoptysis, renal impairment, respiratory failure, congestive cardiac failure, and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a meta-analysis based on pooled data from five cohorts of 537 patients treated with bedaquiline in France, Georgia, Armenia, and South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478224/\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence et al, Emerg Infect Dis. 2019 May; 25(5): 936\u2013943</a>). The Committee noted positive results for rate of culture conversion at 6 months (78%), treatment success (65.8%) and death (11.7%). The Committee also noted that the results were positive despite many patients suffering from \u201ccavitating diseases\u201d such as HIV (120 patients) and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (77 patients).</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence for bedaquiline as part of MDR-TB treatment regime:</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Compassionate use of bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: interim analysis of a French cohort (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320286\" target=\"_blank\">Guglielmetti et al.

Lancet Respir Med. 2018;6(9):699-706</a>), in which 24,014 tuberculosis cases were registered in the EDRweb between 1 July 2014 and 31 March 2016, with 19,617 patients initiated treatment and meeting analysis eligibility criteria. Bedaquiline-containing regimens were given to 743 (4.0%) patients with MDR-TB or RR-TB. Of the 1016 patients who received bedaquiline, 128 died (12.6%); the Committee noted that 4,612 deaths (24.8%) occurred among 18,601 patients on the standard regimens. Bedaquiline was therefore associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0\u00b728\u20130\u00b746) compared with standard regimens.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted one randomised controlled trial submitted by the applicant, but that several non-randomised studies have supported the evidence for bedaquiline as part of individualised multidrug MDR-TB treatment regimen. The Committee noted that in order to comply with the latest guidelines from the World Health Organization, bedaquiline would need to be made available for the treatment of MDR-TB.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the use of amikacin, one of the second-line anti-tuberculosis agents, as an alternative to bedaquiline. The Committee considered that although this Group C agent has comparable efficacy to Group A agents, amikacin has an unfavourable toxicity profile, being associated with renal impairment, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the cardiovascular toxicity profile of bedaquiline, noting that it prolongs the QT interval, especially in combination with moxifloxacin. The Committee noted that very few people stop bedaquiline due to cardiotoxicity, although patients may switch from moxifloxacin to levofloxacin to reduce the combined effect on QT interval. The Committee noted that all patients on bedaquiline would require ECG and serum electrolyte monitoring in line with established guidelines.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bedaquiline results in a more rapid culture conversion compared with other agents, and this in turn would reduce the isolation time required in hospital i.e. being infected with a difficult to treat fatal organism prior to culture conversion. The Committee considered bedaquiline may also lessen the risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other members of the community, where generally patients could be treated in outpatient and community settings. The Committee noted that bedaquiline enables outpatient oral treatment for extrapulmonary TB and pulmonary TB that is no longer infectious.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there would be positive health outcomes and reductions in total healthcare costs by adding bedaquiline to current treatment regimens. The Committee noted the potential reduction in total healthcare costs and increased disability-adjusted life years when bedaquiline is added to the individualised MDR-TB treatment regimen.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that resistance to anti-tuberculosis agents is increasing globally, which may impact on the number of imported cases seen in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the expected number of cases in New Zealand could be approximately 4-7 per year.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that over 78% of TB patients are born outside of New Zealand, and the highest incidence rates of MDR-TB is observed mainly in refugee populations.

Bedaquiline-containing regimens were given to 743 (4.0%) patients with MDR-TB or RR-TB. Of the 1016 patients who received bedaquiline, 128 died (12.6%); the Committee noted that 4,612 deaths (24.8%) occurred among 18,601 patients on the standard regimens. Bedaquiline was therefore associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0\u00b728\u20130\u00b746) compared with standard regimens.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted one randomised controlled trial submitted by the applicant, but that several non-randomised studies have supported the evidence for bedaquiline as part of individualised multidrug MDR-TB treatment regimen.

The Committee noted that very few people stop bedaquiline due to cardiotoxicity, although patients may switch from moxifloxacin to levofloxacin to reduce the combined effect on QT interval. The Committee noted that all patients on bedaquiline would require ECG and serum electrolyte monitoring in line with established guidelines.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bedaquiline results in a more rapid culture conversion compared with other agents, and this in turn would reduce the isolation time required in hospital i.e. being infected with a difficult to treat fatal organism prior to culture conversion. The Committee considered bedaquiline may also lessen the risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other members of the community, where generally patients could be treated in outpatient and community settings. The Committee noted that bedaquiline enables outpatient oral treatment for extrapulmonary TB and pulmonary TB that is no longer infectious.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there would be positive health outcomes and reductions in total healthcare costs by adding bedaquiline to current treatment regimens.

The Committee noted that it had previously reviewed and accepted the minutes from the respective PTAC Subcommittees (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2015-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC February 2015 minutes</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2015-05-updated.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC May 2015 minutes</a>).\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the latest\u00a0<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311389/9789241550529-eng.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">WHO guidelines</a>, which incorporate a meta-analysis of 13,104 patient level data records from 53 studies in 40 countries investigating bedaquiline in MDR-TB. The Committee noted the rate of treatment failure was lower in patients receiving bedaquiline (11.6%) compared with those who did not (48.8%). The Committee noted that treatment failure would require further treatment with other toxic medications and result in patient seclusion/isolation for longer duration of time, especially in regions without infection control isolation facilities with adequate negative pressure etc. The Committee noted that fewer deaths were observed with those taking bedaquiline (15%) when compared with those not taking bedaquiline (22.8%).</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a phase-II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial with 208 participants to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of bedaquiline as part of a combination therapy of MDR-TB (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140958\" target=\"_blank\">Diacon et al, N Eng J Med. 2014;371:723-32</a>). The Committee noted the reduction in the median time to culture conversion in the bedaquiline group (83 days) compared with the placebo group (125 days). The Committee also noted the higher rates of cure observed in the bedaquiline group (58%) compared with placebo group (32%).</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a phase-II, multicentre, open label, single arm study with 241 participants to evaluate the efficacy of bedaquiline as part of an individualised MDR-TB treatment regimen (<a href=\"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/47/2/564.long\" target=\"_blank\">Pym et al, Eur Respir J. 2016;47(2):564-74</a>). The Committee noted the proportion of patients in the bedaquiline group with confirmed culture conversion at weeks 24 in C209 (79.5%) was similar to that of C208 (72.2%). The Committee also noted the higher rates of cure observed in the bedaquiline group (61%) compared with the placebo group (57.6%). The Committee noted that none of the deaths observed in the bedaquiline group appeared directly related to bedaquiline; reported causes of death included tuberculosis-related illness, haemoptysis, renal impairment, respiratory failure, congestive cardiac failure, and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a meta-analysis based on pooled data from five cohorts of 537 patients treated with bedaquiline in France, Georgia, Armenia, and South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478224/\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence et al, Emerg Infect Dis. 2019 May; 25(5): 936\u2013943</a>). The Committee noted positive results for rate of culture conversion at 6 months (78%), treatment success (65.8%) and death (11.7%). The Committee also noted that the results were positive despite many patients suffering from \u201ccavitating diseases\u201d such as HIV (120 patients) and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (77 patients).</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence for bedaquiline as part of MDR-TB treatment regime:</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Compassionate use of bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: interim analysis of a French cohort (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320286\" target=\"_blank\">Guglielmetti et al.

Lancet Respir Med. 2018;6(9):699-706</a>), in which 24,014 tuberculosis cases were registered in the EDRweb between 1 July 2014 and 31 March 2016, with 19,617 patients initiated treatment and meeting analysis eligibility criteria. Bedaquiline-containing regimens were given to 743 (4.0%) patients with MDR-TB or RR-TB. Of the 1016 patients who received bedaquiline, 128 died (12.6%); the Committee noted that 4,612 deaths (24.8%) occurred among 18,601 patients on the standard regimens. Bedaquiline was therefore associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0\u00b728\u20130\u00b746) compared with standard regimens.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted one randomised controlled trial submitted by the applicant, but that several non-randomised studies have supported the evidence for bedaquiline as part of individualised multidrug MDR-TB treatment regimen. The Committee noted that in order to comply with the latest guidelines from the World Health Organization, bedaquiline would need to be made available for the treatment of MDR-TB.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the use of amikacin, one of the second-line anti-tuberculosis agents, as an alternative to bedaquiline. The Committee considered that although this Group C agent has comparable efficacy to Group A agents, amikacin has an unfavourable toxicity profile, being associated with renal impairment, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the cardiovascular toxicity profile of bedaquiline, noting that it prolongs the QT interval, especially in combination with moxifloxacin. The Committee noted that very few people stop bedaquiline due to cardiotoxicity, although patients may switch from moxifloxacin to levofloxacin to reduce the combined effect on QT interval. The Committee noted that all patients on bedaquiline would require ECG and serum electrolyte monitoring in line with established guidelines.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bedaquiline results in a more rapid culture conversion compared with other agents, and this in turn would reduce the isolation time required in hospital i.e. being infected with a difficult to treat fatal organism prior to culture conversion. The Committee considered bedaquiline may also lessen the risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other members of the community, where generally patients could be treated in outpatient and community settings. The Committee noted that bedaquiline enables outpatient oral treatment for extrapulmonary TB and pulmonary TB that is no longer infectious.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there would be positive health outcomes and reductions in total healthcare costs by adding bedaquiline to current treatment regimens. The Committee noted the potential reduction in total healthcare costs and increased disability-adjusted life years when bedaquiline is added to the individualised MDR-TB treatment regimen.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that resistance to anti-tuberculosis agents is increasing globally, which may impact on the number of imported cases seen in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the expected number of cases in New Zealand could be approximately 4-7 per year.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that over 78% of TB patients are born outside of New Zealand, and the highest incidence rates of MDR-TB is observed mainly in refugee populations. The Committee considered that MDR-TB does not have a disproportionate impact on M\u0101ori health.</p><p><span style=\"\">PTAC Comments</span></p>",
