The Subcommittee noted that most CSCC occurs in the head and neck (70-90%), with more than half of the tumours on the anterior scalp, forehead, or ears (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hed.24692\" target=\"_blank\">Amoils et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of mCSCC and laCSCC combined ranged from 1.4% up to 3.7% of total CSCC (<a href=\"https://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(11)00243-9/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Brougham et al.

The Subcommittee noted that a study in Northland, New Zealand found that of the 890 patients identified with advanced CSCC over a 12-month period, only 9 (1%) patients identified as M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543608/\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott et al. NZ Med J. 2018;131:</a><u>61-68</u>) and that in New<b> </b>Zealand Cancer Registry data for 2013, 3 of 164 cases<b> </b>(1.8%) were for M\u0101ori, all in the 70- to 74-year age group (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/cancer-new-registrations-and-deaths-2013\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health 2013 Cancer: New registrations and deaths</a>).</p><p>8.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted there is a significant health need for patients with <span style=\"color: black;\">mCSCC</span> and laCSCC as well as their family and wh\u0101nau. The Subcommittee noted that these patients are typically elderly and suffer from substantial morbidity and high mortality, requiring regular wound dressings and changing, at home nursing care, and regular hospital visits. The Subcommittee noted the presence of distant metastasis correlates to a poor prognosis and a median survival of less than 2 years (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-8049(15)00625-5\" target=\"_blank\">Stratigos et al. Eur J Cancer. 2015;51:1989-2007</a>). The Subcommittee also noted the visual disfigurement often associated with mCSCC and laCSCC can reduce quality of life, affecting physical and psychological health and social relationships (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276814/\" target=\"_blank\">Arunachalam et al.

The Subcommittee noted that in clinical practice, best supportive care (BSC) includes surgery, palliative care, and treatments to reduce symptoms and support quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that chemotherapy options in New Zealand include platinum<span style=\"\">-</span>based and non<span style=\"\">-</span>platinum<span style=\"\">-</span>based chemotherapy, namely cisplatin and fluorouracil; however, the Subcommittee considered that due to the age of the likely patient cohort, many patients present with comorbidities making chemotherapy undesirable due to the associated toxicities.</p><p>8.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cemiplimab is a fully recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor, thereby potentiating T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses. The Subcommittee noted the recommended dose for cemiplimab is 350mg every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with a proposed maximum treatment duration of 24 months. The Subcommittee considered that there was a significant correlation between median number of coding somatic mutations per mega-base in CSCC and objective response rate for anti-PD-L1 therapies, consistent with observations of higher responses to anti-PD1 treatment in other solid tumour of high mutational burden (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc1713444?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Yarchoan et al.

The Subcommittee considered that cemiplimab would create an additional burden for infusion and aseptic production services due to an increased demand for treatment for these patients.

The Subcommittee considered the study population to be similar to New Zealand based on rate of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, however that the unknown comorbidity rates in the trial participants make comparison to relevant patient populations difficult. The Subcommittee considered that the studies provided did not clearly define laCSCC or mCSCC and had loose inclusion criteria and considered this would make targeting therapy for the purpose of any funding criteria very difficult. Furthermore, the Subcommittee considered that patients will likely require several months of treatment with cemiplimab before achieving any initial response. It was considered that published and completed phase II trial data with a longer duration of follow up would be required for the Subcommittee to assess whether cemiplimab has a clinically significant benefit over BSC.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the cost of funding cemiplimab is high and that there is a risk that patients may remain on cemiplimab beyond disease progression due to difficulty in defining disease progression for the purpose of funding criteria. The Subcommittee noted that the inability to accurately define laCSCC in particular could potentially inflate uptake of cemiplimab and also lengthen the duration of treatment. The Subcommittee considered that in the absence of stringent definitions of CSCC disease stage groupings in the Special Authority criteria for cemiplimab, there was the potential for use of cemiplimab outside of the intended population based on use in patients whose disease was not sufficiently advanced and could be considered amenable to surgery or chemotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that there is a lack of evidence to support retreatment of patients with cemiplimab.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted there would likely be changes in health sector expenditure if cemiplimab were funded, such as increased use of imaging (PET/CT scans for head and neck locations), increased costs related to infusion services, and costs associated with managing cemiplimab-related immune reactions. The Subcommittee also considered that, compared to current treatment, patients treated with cemiplimab may not require as much surgery and radical radiotherapy, so long as they remained progression free.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that once a patients&#39; disease progressed, they may typically be offered further palliative radiotherapy and occasionally palliative surgery. The Subcommittee also noted that these palliative treatments were likely to be repeated over time, and that supportive care needs for these patients become increasingly demanding and complex. The Subcommittee considered that patients would be unlikely to continue to visit a medical oncologist or receive further PET or CT imaging once their cancer has progressed. </p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for cemiplimab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of adult patients with mCSCC or laCSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.

The Subcommittee noted the recommended dose for cemiplimab is 350mg every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with a proposed maximum treatment duration of 24 months. The Subcommittee considered that there was a significant correlation between median number of coding somatic mutations per mega-base in CSCC and objective response rate for anti-PD-L1 therapies, consistent with observations of higher responses to anti-PD1 treatment in other solid tumour of high mutational burden (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc1713444?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Yarchoan et al.

The Subcommittee noted the (DOR) exceeded 6 months in 7 of the 13 patients who had a response (54%). The Subcommittee noted there were five deaths: three due to disease progression, one due to an unknown cause in a patient who had discontinued treatment because of disease progression and was subsequently lost to follow up, and one due to an adverse event.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.14.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in the metastatic disease cohort (Group 1 of 1540), 56% had received previous systemic therapy and 85% had received previous radiotherapy.

The Subcommittee noted the median DOR had not been reached at the time of this analysis, however, that the DOR exceeded 6 months in 16 of the 28 patients who had a response (57%). It was noted that neither the PFS nor the median OS were reached at the time of data cut-off, however the estimated 12-month PFS was 53% (95% CI 37 to 66) and the estimated 12-month OS was 81% (95% CI 68 to 89).</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the additional studies below provided by the supplier describing best supportive care (BSC) and chemotherapy (CT) treatment in patients with laCSCC or mCSCC as an indirect comparison to patients receiving cemiplimab treatment.

The Subcommittee considered the study population to be similar to New Zealand based on rate of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, however that the unknown comorbidity rates in the trial participants make comparison to relevant patient populations difficult. The Subcommittee considered that the studies provided did not clearly define laCSCC or mCSCC and had loose inclusion criteria and considered this would make targeting therapy for the purpose of any funding criteria very difficult. Furthermore, the Subcommittee considered that patients will likely require several months of treatment with cemiplimab before achieving any initial response. It was considered that published and completed phase II trial data with a longer duration of follow up would be required for the Subcommittee to assess whether cemiplimab has a clinically significant benefit over BSC.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the cost of funding cemiplimab is high and that there is a risk that patients may remain on cemiplimab beyond disease progression due to difficulty in defining disease progression for the purpose of funding criteria. The Subcommittee noted that the inability to accurately define laCSCC in particular could potentially inflate uptake of cemiplimab and also lengthen the duration of treatment. The Subcommittee considered that in the absence of stringent definitions of CSCC disease stage groupings in the Special Authority criteria for cemiplimab, there was the potential for use of cemiplimab outside of the intended population based on use in patients whose disease was not sufficiently advanced and could be considered amenable to surgery or chemotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that there is a lack of evidence to support retreatment of patients with cemiplimab.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted there would likely be changes in health sector expenditure if cemiplimab were funded, such as increased use of imaging (PET/CT scans for head and neck locations), increased costs related to infusion services, and costs associated with managing cemiplimab-related immune reactions. The Subcommittee also considered that, compared to current treatment, patients treated with cemiplimab may not require as much surgery and radical radiotherapy, so long as they remained progression free.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that once a patients&#39; disease progressed, they may typically be offered further palliative radiotherapy and occasionally palliative surgery. The Subcommittee also noted that these palliative treatments were likely to be repeated over time, and that supportive care needs for these patients become increasingly demanding and complex. The Subcommittee considered that patients would be unlikely to continue to visit a medical oncologist or receive further PET or CT imaging once their cancer has progressed. </p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for cemiplimab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of adult patients with mCSCC or laCSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.

The Subcommittee considered that the studies provided did not clearly define laCSCC or mCSCC and had loose inclusion criteria and considered this would make targeting therapy for the purpose of any funding criteria very difficult. Furthermore, the Subcommittee considered that patients will likely require several months of treatment with cemiplimab before achieving any initial response. It was considered that published and completed phase II trial data with a longer duration of follow up would be required for the Subcommittee to assess whether cemiplimab has a clinically significant benefit over BSC.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the cost of funding cemiplimab is high and that there is a risk that patients may remain on cemiplimab beyond disease progression due to difficulty in defining disease progression for the purpose of funding criteria. The Subcommittee noted that the inability to accurately define laCSCC in particular could potentially inflate uptake of cemiplimab and also lengthen the duration of treatment. The Subcommittee considered that in the absence of stringent definitions of CSCC disease stage groupings in the Special Authority criteria for cemiplimab, there was the potential for use of cemiplimab outside of the intended population based on use in patients whose disease was not sufficiently advanced and could be considered amenable to surgery or chemotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that there is a lack of evidence to support retreatment of patients with cemiplimab.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted there would likely be changes in health sector expenditure if cemiplimab were funded, such as increased use of imaging (PET/CT scans for head and neck locations), increased costs related to infusion services, and costs associated with managing cemiplimab-related immune reactions. The Subcommittee also considered that, compared to current treatment, patients treated with cemiplimab may not require as much surgery and radical radiotherapy, so long as they remained progression free.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that once a patients&#39; disease progressed, they may typically be offered further palliative radiotherapy and occasionally palliative surgery. The Subcommittee also noted that these palliative treatments were likely to be repeated over time, and that supportive care needs for these patients become increasingly demanding and complex. The Subcommittee considered that patients would be unlikely to continue to visit a medical oncologist or receive further PET or CT imaging once their cancer has progressed. </p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for cemiplimab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of adult patients with mCSCC or laCSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000W5KOt&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001vmFv\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
