The Committee considered that the removal of the C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and prednisone criteria would mean that Special Authority access would not require blood tests and so would reduce barriers in particular for those who experience additional systemic barriers when accessing medicines, such as Māori. The Committee considered that the impact of these changes on reducing inequities between Māori and non-Māori was not able to be estimated.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that this funding proposal was initiated as a result of previous recommendations made by the then <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-14-Rheumatology-Subcommittee-record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Rheumatology Subcommittee in May 2021</a>, when reviewing the CRP criterion in the adalimumab and etanercept Special Authority criteria, for the initiation of these respective treatments in rheumatoid arthritis. The Committee noted that individuals with PsA often present with a normal CRP and so removal of this criteria would result in fewer courses of prednisone required prior to accessing biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current Special Authority criteria for adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab for PsA require a person to have an elevated CRP (&gt;15 mg/L) or (ESR) (&gt;25 mm/hour) or be taking at least 5 mg of prednisone.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health need</em></h3><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that neither an elevated CRP nor ESR were good indicators of PsA disease activity. The Committee considered that having a high CRP confers a greater risk of subsequent joint damage but that low CRP does not correlate with low disease activity. The Committee considered that number and location of affected joints, skin involvement, and location were important indicators of disease activity (symptom burden and functional impact) in PsA. The Committee considered that there is evidence to support that higher CRP predicts structural damage and therefore people with high CRP have a worse disease prognosis.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the use of prednisone to allow access to first line biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in those with non-elevated CRP or ESR in those with moderate to severe PsA poses an increased risk of erythrodermic psoriasis, which can be severe and often requires hospitalisation upon tapering of prednisone. The Committee considered that those with PsA often have associated comorbidities that contraindicate the use of prednisone or increase the risk of adverse effects from prednisone, including hyperglycaemia, weight gain, osteoporosis, cataracts, risk of infection, and risk of erythrodermic psoriasis flare, increasing the barriers for these people to access funded treatment. The Committee considered that those who are treated with prednisone to access biologic treatment (adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab) could experience a decrease in their disease activity that results in them no longer seeking access to more appropriate, long-term biologic treatment. The Committee considered that prednisone was not a long-term option for the treatment of PsA. The Committee noted that the use of glucocorticosteroids is included with caution recommended in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines 2019 (<a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/700.1"" target=""_blank"">Gossec et al.

The Committee considered that compared with rheumatoid arthritis, CRP and ESR are less relevant in relation to PsA disease activity.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that pivotal trials for adalimumab (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/art.21306"" target=""_blank"">Mease et al.

The Committee considered that the removal of the C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and prednisone criteria would mean that Special Authority access would not require blood tests and so would reduce barriers in particular for those who experience additional systemic barriers when accessing medicines, such as Māori.

The Committee noted that individuals with PsA often present with a normal CRP and so removal of this criteria would result in fewer courses of prednisone required prior to accessing biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current Special Authority criteria for adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab for PsA require a person to have an elevated CRP (&gt;15 mg/L) or (ESR) (&gt;25 mm/hour) or be taking at least 5 mg of prednisone.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health need</em></h3><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that neither an elevated CRP nor ESR were good indicators of PsA disease activity. The Committee considered that having a high CRP confers a greater risk of subsequent joint damage but that low CRP does not correlate with low disease activity. The Committee considered that number and location of affected joints, skin involvement, and location were important indicators of disease activity (symptom burden and functional impact) in PsA. The Committee considered that there is evidence to support that higher CRP predicts structural damage and therefore people with high CRP have a worse disease prognosis.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the use of prednisone to allow access to first line biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in those with non-elevated CRP or ESR in those with moderate to severe PsA poses an increased risk of erythrodermic psoriasis, which can be severe and often requires hospitalisation upon tapering of prednisone. The Committee considered that those with PsA often have associated comorbidities that contraindicate the use of prednisone or increase the risk of adverse effects from prednisone, including hyperglycaemia, weight gain, osteoporosis, cataracts, risk of infection, and risk of erythrodermic psoriasis flare, increasing the barriers for these people to access funded treatment. The Committee considered that those who are treated with prednisone to access biologic treatment (adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab) could experience a decrease in their disease activity that results in them no longer seeking access to more appropriate, long-term biologic treatment. The Committee considered that prednisone was not a long-term option for the treatment of PsA. The Committee noted that the use of glucocorticosteroids is included with caution recommended in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines 2019 (<a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/700.1"" target=""_blank"">Gossec et al.

The Committee considered that compared with rheumatoid arthritis, CRP and ESR are less relevant in relation to PsA disease activity.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that pivotal trials for adalimumab (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/art.21306"" target=""_blank"">Mease et al.

The Committee considered that the impact of these changes on reducing inequities between Māori and non-Māori was not able to be estimated.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that this funding proposal was initiated as a result of previous recommendations made by the then <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-14-Rheumatology-Subcommittee-record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Rheumatology Subcommittee in May 2021</a>, when reviewing the CRP criterion in the adalimumab and etanercept Special Authority criteria, for the initiation of these respective treatments in rheumatoid arthritis. The Committee noted that individuals with PsA often present with a normal CRP and so removal of this criteria would result in fewer courses of prednisone required prior to accessing biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current Special Authority criteria for adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab for PsA require a person to have an elevated CRP (&gt;15 mg/L) or (ESR) (&gt;25 mm/hour) or be taking at least 5 mg of prednisone.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health need</em></h3><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that neither an elevated CRP nor ESR were good indicators of PsA disease activity. The Committee considered that having a high CRP confers a greater risk of subsequent joint damage but that low CRP does not correlate with low disease activity. The Committee considered that number and location of affected joints, skin involvement, and location were important indicators of disease activity (symptom burden and functional impact) in PsA. The Committee considered that there is evidence to support that higher CRP predicts structural damage and therefore people with high CRP have a worse disease prognosis.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the use of prednisone to allow access to first line biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in those with non-elevated CRP or ESR in those with moderate to severe PsA poses an increased risk of erythrodermic psoriasis, which can be severe and often requires hospitalisation upon tapering of prednisone. The Committee considered that those with PsA often have associated comorbidities that contraindicate the use of prednisone or increase the risk of adverse effects from prednisone, including hyperglycaemia, weight gain, osteoporosis, cataracts, risk of infection, and risk of erythrodermic psoriasis flare, increasing the barriers for these people to access funded treatment. The Committee considered that those who are treated with prednisone to access biologic treatment (adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab) could experience a decrease in their disease activity that results in them no longer seeking access to more appropriate, long-term biologic treatment. The Committee considered that prednisone was not a long-term option for the treatment of PsA. The Committee noted that the use of glucocorticosteroids is included with caution recommended in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines 2019 (<a href=""https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/700.1"" target=""_blank"">Gossec et al.

The Committee considered that compared with rheumatoid arthritis, CRP and ESR are less relevant in relation to PsA disease activity.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that pivotal trials for adalimumab (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/art.21306"" target=""_blank"">Mease et al.

The Committee considered that these trials demonstrated benefit for these agents and considered that participants included in the pivotal trials considered inclusion criteria based on CRP or ESR. The Committee noted that the inclusion criteria of these trials did not require an elevated CRP or ESR to enter the trial. The Committee considered that the selection of patients with a higher baseline CRP or ESR could have been preferred due to a perception that they are more likely to respond to treatment.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2007;66:493-7</a>). The Committee considered that the composite outcome (ACR50) to measure the impact of treatment included CRP within the composite and therefore biased the reported results. The Committee noted that it reported that the absence of arthritis in large joints also positively influenced the likelihood of experiencing a good therapeutic response. The Committee considered that this was unlikely to be accurate.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>\xa0The Committee considered that there was reasonable evidence to suggest that elevated CRP was generally predictive of structural damage long-term, and that it was likely that those people with non-elevated CRP would therefore be likely be at slightly lower risk of long-term structural damage. The Committee considered that while there was some evidence that indicated there may be a superior response to treatment experienced by those people with higher CRP, this is uncertain given the instruments used to measure disease activity.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Cost and savings</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there would be reduced costs from not requiring prednisone treatment to access adalimumab, etanercept, or secukinumab due to a reduction in the adverse effects relating to the use of prednisone.</p><p><br></p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the number of people accessing adalimumab, etanercept, and secukinumab would not significantly increase as a result of the removal of CRP, ESR, and prednisone criteria for PsA. The Committee considered it reasonable to estimate that 80-90% of those unable to access biologic treatment due to non-elevated CRP or ESR would use prednisone to access funded treatment. The Committee considered that the similar changes to the rheumatoid arthritis criteria for adalimumab and etanercept did not significantly change the volume of adalimumab or etanercept dispensed.</p><p><br></p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Funding criteria</em></h3><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that these proposed criteria changes were in line with the rheumatoid arthritis changes made for adalimumab and etanercept. The Committee considered the approval periods for adalimumab, etanercept or secukinumab for rheumatology indications should be aligned to reduce the time burden of re-application on practitioners. The Committee considered that the continued prescribing of treatments was not determined by the length of the Special Authority approval period, and if a treatment was no longer effective then prescribers would consider other funded options.</p><p><br></p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the CRP criterion was not relevant to the level of disease activity in PsA and the use of prednisone to bypass this criterion was not in the person receiving treatment’s best interest.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the inclusion of the ESR criterion was impractical as it is rarely used for assessing inflammatory disease activity and laboratories do not approve the use of this test for PsA.
