The Subcommittee noted that the applicant had stated that patients with a mitochondrial disorder can present with “any symptom, in any organ at any age” making it difficult for metabolic paediatricians to exclude a CoQ10 deficiency disorder, and as such, had proposed that such patients would commence treatment with CoQ10 while awaiting confirmation of a diagnosis. </p><p>1.10<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders are the likely intent of this application, however, the proposed patient population in New Zealand had not been further defined by the applicant. The Subcommittee considered that, if restricted to include only patients with the primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders, and assuming 10 patients per year plus one new diagnosis per year (which was considered a reasonable estimate), then the prevalence of primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders would be less than 1 in 50,000 in New Zealand; and this indication would meet the definition of a rare disorder as per the second of <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/medicines-for-rare-disorders/"" target=""_blank"">PHARMAC’s Three Principles for Rare Disorders</a>. </p><p><i>Evidence</i></p><p>1.11<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of a 2012 Cochrane review (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513923"" target=""_blank"">Pfeffer et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the authors concluded that there were no statistically significant differences (<i>P</i> values not published) between CoQ10 and placebo in regard to fatigue in activities of daily living score or sustained endurance strength. The Subcommittee noted that the 2012 Cochrane review (paragraph 1.15, above) had excluded this trial due to what the authors considered to be high risk of bias due to non-randomisation, poor study design and potential selective outcome reporting.</p><p>1.13.3<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of an open-label, single-arm study in 44 patients (adults and young people) with mitochondrial myopathies who received CoQ10 2 mg per kg daily for 6 months, designed to select those patients who responded to therapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2089142"" target=""_blank"">Bresolin et al. 1990</a>). The Subcommittee noted there was a statistically significant increase in the global Medical Research Council\xa0scale for muscle strength after 6 months treatment with CoQ10 (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) and a small but significant reduction in serum lactate between baseline and 9 months (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), however, the 2017 NICE evidence summary considered that the clinical significance of these changes was unclear.

However, members considered that performing high-quality, randomised, controlled trials in this heterogenous patient population is challenging. Members noted that more than 150 genes are involved in the respiratory chain process making trial recruitment difficult and considered that evidence from small, lower-quality studies should be evaluated. </p><p>1.18<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that patients with primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders may respond best to CoQ10.

The Subcommittee noted that while most applications were for children, patient age at the time of application ranged from 10 months to 41 years, that the average requested dosage was 360 mg per day (median 300 mg per day), and that most applications had been approved.</p><p>1.9<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the applicant had requested CoQ10 capsules (stating that availability of additional dose forms as well would be preferred) for the treatment of approximately 10 patients per year with suspected or known mitochondrial disorders with possible or known CoQ10 responsiveness, and had proposed dosing that ranges from 10 mg per kg up to 100 mg per kg per day. The Subcommittee noted that the applicant had stated that patients with a mitochondrial disorder can present with “any symptom, in any organ at any age” making it difficult for metabolic paediatricians to exclude a CoQ10 deficiency disorder, and as such, had proposed that such patients would commence treatment with CoQ10 while awaiting confirmation of a diagnosis. </p><p>1.10<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders are the likely intent of this application, however, the proposed patient population in New Zealand had not been further defined by the applicant. The Subcommittee considered that, if restricted to include only patients with the primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders, and assuming 10 patients per year plus one new diagnosis per year (which was considered a reasonable estimate), then the prevalence of primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders would be less than 1 in 50,000 in New Zealand; and this indication would meet the definition of a rare disorder as per the second of <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/medicines-for-rare-disorders/"" target=""_blank"">PHARMAC’s Three Principles for Rare Disorders</a>. </p><p><i>Evidence</i></p><p>1.11<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of a 2012 Cochrane review (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513923"" target=""_blank"">Pfeffer et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012. 18: CD004426</a>), which included 12 studies and aimed to determine whether there is objective evidence to support the use of current treatments, including CoQ10, for mitochondrial disorders.

The Subcommittee noted that the authors concluded that there were no statistically significant differences (<i>P</i> values not published) between CoQ10 and placebo in regard to fatigue in activities of daily living score or sustained endurance strength. The Subcommittee noted that the 2012 Cochrane review (paragraph 1.15, above) had excluded this trial due to what the authors considered to be high risk of bias due to non-randomisation, poor study design and potential selective outcome reporting.</p><p>1.13.3<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of an open-label, single-arm study in 44 patients (adults and young people) with mitochondrial myopathies who received CoQ10 2 mg per kg daily for 6 months, designed to select those patients who responded to therapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2089142"" target=""_blank"">Bresolin et al. 1990</a>). The Subcommittee noted there was a statistically significant increase in the global Medical Research Council\xa0scale for muscle strength after 6 months treatment with CoQ10 (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) and a small but significant reduction in serum lactate between baseline and 9 months (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), however, the 2017 NICE evidence summary considered that the clinical significance of these changes was unclear.

However, members considered that performing high-quality, randomised, controlled trials in this heterogenous patient population is challenging. Members noted that more than 150 genes are involved in the respiratory chain process making trial recruitment difficult and considered that evidence from small, lower-quality studies should be evaluated. </p><p>1.18<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that patients with primary CoQ10 deficiency disorders may respond best to CoQ10.
