The Committee noted that most treatments are focussed on reducing the motor off periods while balancing the risk of toxicity or side effects, which include augmentation (a hyperkinetic period followed by a period of relative motor normalcy and then a hypokinetic period).

In advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reportedly reduced &#39;off&#39; time and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. Rotigotine did not meet a prespecified response-rate noninferiority criterion compared to ropinirole, although the authors noted the doses used may not have been directly comparable. Rotigotine was reportedly non-inferior to oral pramipexole in reducing &#39;off&#39; time, although it did not meet a response-rate noninferiority criterion (SP515 trial). Rotigotine was reported to improve morning motor functioning and reduced sleep disturbances, night-time motor symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain and functioning, and quality of life to a significantly greater extent than placebo.

Pooling of the studies suggested that for patients with early or advanced PD, rotigotine could significantly improve UPDRS Part III and Part II scores <em>(P</em>&lt; 0.001) but had significantly higher incidence of adverse events than the placebo (<em>P</em>&lt; 0.001). The authors concluded that rotigotine can improve daily living and motor ability of patients with PD, although it has higher reported incidence of adverse events.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.15635"" target=""_blank"">Chen et al.

A total of 34 RCTs (7868 patients) were included in the study. Analysis suggested six commonly used non-ergot dopamine agonists are effective as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced Parkinson’s disease. Ropinirole prolonged-release was associated with the best improvement in UPDRS-II, UPDRS-III, and UPDRS-II\u2009+\u2009III (0.811, 0.742, and 0.827). For off-time reduction, pramipexole immediate release ranked first (0.979), and ropinirole prolonged release ranked first in off-time responder rate (0.927).

Six studies were included across early and advanced Parkinson’s disease. In early Parkinson&#39;s disease, rotigotine initiated without levodopa had reportedly significantly greater improvements than placebo in the UPDRS. In advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reportedly reduced &#39;off&#39; time and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. Rotigotine did not meet a prespecified response-rate noninferiority criterion compared to ropinirole, although the authors noted the doses used may not have been directly comparable. Rotigotine was reportedly non-inferior to oral pramipexole in reducing &#39;off&#39; time, although it did not meet a response-rate noninferiority criterion (SP515 trial). Rotigotine was reported to improve morning motor functioning and reduced sleep disturbances, night-time motor symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain and functioning, and quality of life to a significantly greater extent than placebo. Rotigotine was stated to be generally well tolerated across the trials and in longer-term extension studies.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27170229/"" target=""_blank"">Rizos et al.

Participants were matched according to on sex, age, documented Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and duration of disease, age at Parkinson’s disease onset, past use of dopamine agonists (dose and duration), discontinuation of past dopamine agonists and reason for discontinuation, duration of current dopamine agonist use, use of any other antiparkinsonian medication, and comorbid conditions. People with clinically judged dementia were not included. Findings suggested a relatively low incidence of emergent impulse control disorders (ICD) associated with long acting or transdermal dopamine agonists. ICD rates with rotigotine patch (4.9%) as well as with pramipexole-prolonged release (6.6%) were signiﬁcantly less than for other dopamine agonist formulations (pramipexole IR (19.0%; <em>P</em>&lt; 0.05)). 50.9% of Parkinson’s disease patients presenting with ICD needed to discontinue dopamine agonist therapy.

It was reported that the main differences between the ICD and non-ICD groups were type of dopamine agonist intake and age. Oral dopamine agonist treatment (pramipexole and ropinirole) was associated with higher risk of ICD compared with transdermal dopamine agonist (rotigotine); of people treated with oral dopamine agonists, 84/197 (42%) developed ICD compared to 7/36 (19%) of those treated with transdermal dopamine agonists (Fisher&#39;s exact text &lt;0.01).

The Committee considered that choice of pharmacotherapies would be dependent on the assessment and preferences of the individual clinician. The Committee considered that agents from different classes are often used together to limit the need for higher doses of any one agent, thus minimise the side effects and maximise effect.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>
