The Subcommittee also noted the results of the Murano trial of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with venetoclax-rituximab, in which, 16.5% of patients experienced progression or death and there was a 2 year progression free survival (PFS) of 84.9% (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976"" target=""_blank"">Seymour et al.

The Subcommittee considered that as a subsequent line of therapy, given that ibrutinib has a different mechanism of action to venetoclax, patients refractory to venetoclax could respond to ibrutinib. The Subcommittee noted the recent publication of an observational retrospective consecutive case series, in which ibrutinib was reported to be effective for patients with CLL who progressed on venetoclax after a remission period of greater than 24 months, 91% of whom obtained an objective response (OR) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244251/"" target=""_blank"">Lin et al. Blood. 2020;135:2266-70</a>).

However, the Subcommittee considered that there would be less pressure to use effective but potentially toxic therapies in first line, and therefore it would be important to specify the definition of relapsed/refractory and ensure that patients had undergone appropriate first line therapy such as receiving at least two cycles of chemoimmunotherapy in first line.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.10. </span>The Subcommittee considered that if ibrutinib were funded in the relapsed/refractory setting, there would be a reduction in the requirement for TLS prophylactic regimens and associated hospital admissions.

Haematolgica. 2018;103:1511-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients receiving treatment with venetoclax require monitoring for TLS. The Subcommittee noted the need to admit high risk, and some intermediate risk, patients and the need for outpatient laboratory monitoring of low risk patients. The Subcommittee considered that there can be difficulties obtaining timely laboratory results for regional patients whose blood must be sent to a main centre for analysis. The Subcommittee considered that for patients living in rural areas, where local laboratory monitoring may not be readily available, ibrutinib would provide a more suitable treatment option than venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that while ibrutinib would be more convenient in these circumstances, the majority of patients can be managed appropriately with a TLS prophylactic strategy in place.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p><br></p>', 'fs': '<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current treatment options for patients ineligible for fludarabine based chemoimmunotherapy (fludarabine ± cyclophosphamide and rituximab) were obinutuzumab-chlorambucil or bendamustine-rituximab, and noted that bendamustine-rituximab was not funded in the relapsed/refractory setting.

Haematolgica. 2018;103:1511-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients receiving treatment with venetoclax require monitoring for TLS. The Subcommittee noted the need to admit high risk, and some intermediate risk, patients and the need for outpatient laboratory monitoring of low risk patients. The Subcommittee considered that there can be difficulties obtaining timely laboratory results for regional patients whose blood must be sent to a main centre for analysis. The Subcommittee considered that for patients living in rural areas, where local laboratory monitoring may not be readily available, ibrutinib would provide a more suitable treatment option than venetoclax. The Subcommittee considered that while ibrutinib would be more convenient in these circumstances, the majority of patients can be managed appropriately with a TLS prophylactic strategy in place.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p><br></p>', 'PTAC_Comments__c': '<p><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(62, 62, 60);"">PTAC noted and agreed with the Subcommittee’s recorded considerations and recommendations regarding\xa0this application.</span></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000CDC9QAO'}, 'change': None}]",Jun 2020,False,True

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
