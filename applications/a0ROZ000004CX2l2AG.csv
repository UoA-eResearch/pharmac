Am J Epidemiol. 2012; 176(6):527-33</a>). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza or pneumonia across three consecutive influenza seasons, which were assessed over three time periods around peak influenza incidence (narrow, intermediate, and broad). The Committee noted that the study was limited by not using PCR or culture to confirm influenza but rather measured rates of hospitalisations corresponding to the influenza seasons as a surrogate indicator for influenza. The Committee also noted that the administration of aTIV versus TIV was not randomised and that the aTIV was given to a frailer population with more comorbidities, as per local guidelines, hence introducing a potentially large selection bias. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Mannino study used a propensity score to adjust for multiple confounders, and that several variables used in the derivation of the propensity score had also been used as explanatory variables in their multivariate model.

The Committee considered that the intermediate time window OR would be more appropriate to use in PHARMAC’s modelling of reductions in hospitalisations and other morbidity, relative to any potential use of the narrow time window estimate of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.98), as the intermediate time window is more conservative and where a conservative approach would be recommended in light of the poor quality of evidence; but that sensitivity analysis could incorporate the other time windows.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted four other studies identified by the supplier that compared the relative effectiveness of aTIV compared to TIV: </p><p><a href="""" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Gravenstein et al. Unpublished -IDWeek Abstract 996. 2018</a>: reporting a prospective open-label cluster randomised controlled trial (n=50,012 total participants) for those aged 65 years or older living in a nursing home for at least 100 days. In all, 411 US nursing homes were reported to be randomised to provide aTIV as standard of care for their residents, with 409 nursing homes randomised to provide TIV as standard of care. There were three primary outcomes for the study, of which the first listed was time to any hospitalisation. The Committee noted that the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause hospitalisations was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88 to 1), P=0.05 for aTIV relative to TIV. The incidence of all-cause hospitalisation was 18.8% in the aTIV group and 20.0% in the TIV group, consistent with a point estimate for relative vaccine effectiveness of 6% greater than TIV. The Committee considered the trial reporting to date, as a conference abstract, was inadequate to reasonably assess the study’s validity, including (but not confined to) that there was no description of randomisation methods, and overall a lack of sufficient methodological description in the poster. The Committee also noted that the description of the cohort characteristics was incomplete, and considered the likely more elderly and morbid population seen in American nursing homes was unlikely to be reflective of the whole New Zealand 65+ years population, so considered the results would not be relevant to a New Zealand population at this stage, pending the full publication of the study, including patient characteristics and other features necessary for reasonable interpretation of internal validity and then generalisation to the New Zealand funding setting. </p><p><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16050515/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Iob et al.

The Committee noted that the OR for any vaccination was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68) with a point estimate relative any vaccine effectiveness of 44%. The Committee considered that the study’s analysis of results was incorrect as it had failed to adjust for individuals clustered within residential care facilities and so the study, when properly analysed from the reported summary data, had no evidence of a difference between residents who had or had not received any vaccination (recalculated OR 0.83 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.12), P=0.31). The assessment of the validity of the comparison of aTIV versus TIV not only did not take account of clustering but variably included or excluded care facilities from the analysis.

The Committee considered that it was not appropriate to assume reduced mortality from the intervention based on Mannino et al. or any of the other evidence presented, due to poor quality of the evidence. The Committed noted the evidence only reported reduction in hospitalisation, and not mortality, attributable to aTIV compared to TIV.

Unpublished -IDWeek Abstract 996. 2018</a>: reporting a prospective open-label cluster randomised controlled trial (n=50,012 total participants) for those aged 65 years or older living in a nursing home for at least 100 days. In all, 411 US nursing homes were reported to be randomised to provide aTIV as standard of care for their residents, with 409 nursing homes randomised to provide TIV as standard of care. There were three primary outcomes for the study, of which the first listed was time to any hospitalisation. The Committee noted that the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause hospitalisations was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88 to 1), P=0.05 for aTIV relative to TIV. The incidence of all-cause hospitalisation was 18.8% in the aTIV group and 20.0% in the TIV group, consistent with a point estimate for relative vaccine effectiveness of 6% greater than TIV. The Committee considered the trial reporting to date, as a conference abstract, was inadequate to reasonably assess the study’s validity, including (but not confined to) that there was no description of randomisation methods, and overall a lack of sufficient methodological description in the poster. The Committee also noted that the description of the cohort characteristics was incomplete, and considered the likely more elderly and morbid population seen in American nursing homes was unlikely to be reflective of the whole New Zealand 65+ years population, so considered the results would not be relevant to a New Zealand population at this stage, pending the full publication of the study, including patient characteristics and other features necessary for reasonable interpretation of internal validity and then generalisation to the New Zealand funding setting. </p><p><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16050515/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Iob et al.

The Committee considered that this may be due less imported influenza, to the social distancing and isolation effects of the nationwide lockdown response for the COVID-19 pandemic on person-to-person transmission of all airborne infectious diseases, plus unprecedented levels of influenza vaccination for older adults and the Pacific population over a much shorter period of time than previous seasons.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted two studies by Khieu et al. investigating hospitalisation and mortality incidence rates in New Zealand attributable to influenza from 1994 to 2008 (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26143611/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Khieu et al.

The Committee noted that the hospitalisation rate (62.4 per 100,000) and mortality rate (13.5 per 100,000) presented in these studies were appreciably higher than those in the SHIVERS data (hospitalisation 47.1 per 100,000 and mortality 0.6 per 100,000). The Committee considered that the mortality incidence presented by Khieu et al. was reasonable, and that mortality rates estimated from routine coded data (Ministry of Health, SHIVERS) is likely an underestimate of the population burden of disease. </p><p>The Committee noted that the Khieu studies reported marked ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities, particularly with hospitalisation rates and mortality. The Committee also noted that Māori and Pacific peoples are less likely to visit a GP for influenza-like symptoms and less likely to be vaccinated against influenza than people of European/Other decent. The Committee noted that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Canadian and US indigenous populations show similar inequalities when compared with the Caucasian populations in those countries. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the appropriate comparator for aQIV in New Zealand is QIV, but because there are no head-to-head trials of aQIV comparing with a QIV, the supplier had instead provided an indirect comparison with aTIV as the common comparator. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a phase III multi-centre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial that compared aTIV to aQIV using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) as a surrogate endpoint (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31635976/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Essink et al. Vaccine. 2020;38(2):242-50</a>). The Committee noted that aQIV produced a similar immune response to aTIV against homologous influenza strains, and that the immune response against B strains was below the those of the FDA&#39;s Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criteria. The Committee noted that this was presented by the supplier in the application as an unpublished report of a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial (V118_20, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03314662) of safety and immunogenicity of aQIV compared with aTIV in elderly adults (n=1778).

The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza or pneumonia across three consecutive influenza seasons, which were assessed over three time periods around peak influenza incidence (narrow, intermediate, and broad). The Committee noted that the study was limited by not using PCR or culture to confirm influenza but rather measured rates of hospitalisations corresponding to the influenza seasons as a surrogate indicator for influenza. The Committee also noted that the administration of aTIV versus TIV was not randomised and that the aTIV was given to a frailer population with more comorbidities, as per local guidelines, hence introducing a potentially large selection bias. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Mannino study used a propensity score to adjust for multiple confounders, and that several variables used in the derivation of the propensity score had also been used as explanatory variables in their multivariate model.

All the point estimates were associated with wide confidence intervals with the upper confidence limits being close to or crossing a boundary, consistent with no effect.</p><p>The Committee noted the intermediate time window odds-ratio (OR) of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.03) was that used by the supplier to inform reduced hospitalisations from aQIV vs QIV.

The Subcommittee noted that the highest proportion of hospitalisations and deaths attributable to influenza were in adults aged 65 and over, and that influenza attributable death rates are higher for more deprived areas of New Zealand (NZDep2013 quintiles 9 and 10; RR (NZDep 9 and 10 compared with quintiles 1 and 2) 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.4). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the influenza attributable mortality rates reported by the Ministry of Health (MoH) provide a lower estimate than that reported in the Khieu et al. 2017 study.

The Subcommittee considered that the absence of a head-to-head comparison of QIV with aQIV was a substantial limitation with the application. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Subcommittee noted a phase III multi-centre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial that compared aTIV to aQIV using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) as a surrogate endpoint (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31635976/"" target=""_blank"">Essink et al. Vaccine. 2020;38(2):242-50</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the trial demonstrated non-inferiority of aQIV compared with aTIV for geometric mean titre and seroconversion rates, and that reactogenicity profiles were generally comparable. The Subcommittee noted that aQIV demonstrated immunogenicity against two B lineages, compared with aTIV which only includes one B lineage. However, the Subcommittee noted that the evidence presented in the study was only for immunogenicity, and that the data was primarily for immunogenicity rather than vaccine effectiveness, so considered that the evidence for clinical benefit of aQIV over aTIV was limited. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Subcommittee noted a prospective, non-experimental cohort study (n=107,661, 170,988 person-years) in a community setting (excluding residents of aged-care facilities) comparing aTIV with unadjuvanted TIV in northern Italy (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22940713/"" target=""_blank"">Mannino et al. Am J Epidemiol. 2012; 176(6):527-33</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the primary endpoint was the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza or pneumonia across three consecutive influenza seasons, which were assessed over three time periods around peak influenza incidence (narrow, ie. those weeks adjacent to peak influenza occurrence with &gt; 1 case per 1000 person-weeks; intermediate, ie. those weeks adjacent to peak influenza occurrence with &gt; 0.5 cases per 1000 person-weeks; broad, the entire influenza season). The Subcommittee noted that there was uncertainty around the vaccine effectiveness estimates from this study and considered the narrow time window’s 25% reduction in influenza attributable hospitalisations with aTIV to be an overestimate. The Subcommittee considered that it would be more appropriate to look at the broad time window in order to assess effectiveness across the whole influenza season. The Subcommittee also noted that the intermediate time window improvement of 17% reduction in hospitalisations was not statistically significant. The Subcommittee considered that the considerable variation between time windows, makes it difficult to ascertain which data is most valid to use to inform future modelling. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Subcommittee noted that the Mannino study was limited by not using PCR or culture to confirm influenza, but rather measured rates of hospitalisations corresponding to the influenza seasons as a surrogate indicator for influenza. The Subcommittee also noted that the administration of aTIV versus TIV was not randomised and that aTIV was given to a frailer population with more comorbidities, as per local guidelines, hence introducing a potentially large selection bias. The Subcommittee noted that Mannino study used a propensity score to adjust for multiple confounders, and that several variables used in the derivation of the propensity score had also been used as explanatory variables in their multivariate model. The Committee noted that adjusting for the same confounders twice may lead to type 1 error, underestimating the true extent of uncertainty.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Subcommittee noted a number of additional studies comparing the efficacy of aTIV to TIV: </p><p>1.13.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16050515/"" target=""_blank"">Iob et al.

In all, 411 US nursing homes were reported to be randomised to provide aTIV as standard of care for their residents, with 409 nursing homes randomised to provide TIV as standard of care. There were three primary outcomes for the study, of which the first listed was time to any hospitalisation. The Subcommittee noted that the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause hospitalisations was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88 to 1), P=0.05 for aTIV relative to TIV. The incidence of all-cause hospitalisation was 18.8% in the aTIV group and 20.0% in the TIV group, consistent with a point estimate for relative vaccine effectiveness of 6% greater than TIV.
