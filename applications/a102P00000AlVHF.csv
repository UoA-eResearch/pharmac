The Committee noted that the clinician application described uncommon syndromes, such as Unverricht-Lundborg disease and Lafora disease, which cause complex myoclonic epilepsy that is associated with progressive myoclonic seizures. Members considered that the small group of patients with complex myoclonic epilepsy would be a subtype of the population with POS or epilepsy syndromes and are distinct from the group of patients with PGTC seizures. </p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is 40 times more likely among patients with epilepsy who continue to have seizures than in those who are seizure free disease, and that epilepsy significantly affects many activities especially driving. The Committee noted that epilepsy can also have an adverse effect on employment and is associated with risks and adverse outcomes in pregnancy. The Committee considered that patients with PGTC seizures and those with POS experiencing secondary GTC seizures have a high health need due to the impact on their daily activities and an increased requirement for hospital visits due to seizures. </p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that the relatively small number of patients with indeterminate epilepsy or other syndromes, as per International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definitions (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.13709"" target=""_blank"">Scheffer et al. Epilepsia. 2017;58:512-21</a>), and patients with epilepsy secondary to other conditions e.g. primary or secondary tumours, strokes, head injury or infection, which were not included within the applicant-proposed patient groups, may have an unmet health need.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are 16 funded anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in New Zealand, and that the suitability of an AED for a particular patient may be influenced by known side effects e.g. exacerbating myoclonus, risks associated with pregnancy, and long-term effects that prescribers are well aware of. The Committee noted that the treatment paradigm in New Zealand as outlined by the supplier for POS and PGTC seizures is as described in 8.14.1 and 8.14.2 below, and considered that, although this may differ from that followed in routine practice for treatment of POS and PGTC (e.g. phenytoin is infrequently used, and valproate may not be used as an initial treatment), the treatment paradigm for patients with complex myoclonic epilepsy would be similar to that for patients experiencing POS:</p><p>1.7.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Patients with POS receive valproate, topiramate and levetiracetam as first, second and third-line AEDs, respectively; then carbamazepine, lamotrigine and/or phenytoin as fourth and fifth-line AEDs; then lacosamide as a sixth line treatment (all funded without restriction except lacosamide); and </p><p>1.7.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Patients with PGTC seizures receive first-line treatment with valproate, then second-line treatment includes the addition of, or substitution for, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate or clobazam (all funded without restriction). </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that refractory or drug resistant epilepsy is defined by the ILAE as not obtaining seizure freedom after adequate trials of two tolerated appropriate AED schedules; while the medical literature suggests up to 25% of patients with epilepsy would meet this definition, in New Zealand this could be about one-third of all patients with epilepsy (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/epilepsy-tag-paper-1-defining-epilepsy.docx"" target=""_blank"">Epilepsy Technical Advisory Group, Ministry of Health. 2017</a>). The Committee considered that drug resistant epilepsy would include patients with either POS or PGTC seizures. Members considered that patients who are severely affected by drug resistant epilepsy have a high health need and require additional treatment options. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that while estimated patient numbers provided by the supplier were reasonable and seizure types were clearly defined, it may be challenging to consistently distinguish and characterise patients for the purposes of targeting funded treatment. The Committee considered that PHARMAC could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee and/or other expert advisors regarding the optimal positioning of perampanel, if it were to be funded, within New Zealand treatment paradigms for epilepsies. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that perampanel is a first-in-class molecule that is a selective, non-competitive antagonist of the AMPA (ionotropic α-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid) type glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons; this mechanism of action is different to that of many other AEDs which instead interact with the sodium channel. Members considered that, due to the different mechanism of action, clinicians may have a preference to use perampanel relatively early in the treatment paradigm over additional sodium channel blockers. The Committee noted that perampanel may interact with other AEDs and is teratogenic.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that perampanel is an oral tablet taken once daily at night, and is approved by Medsafe for the adjunctive treatment of adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age with epilepsy who have either POS with or without secondary generalised seizures, or PGTC seizures in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence for perampanel for the treatment of POS from double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III clinical trials in patients ≥12 years of age with POS with or without secondary generalisation, whose epilepsy had failed treatment with two or more AEDs, who had at least five partial seizures during baseline and who were taking stable doses of up to three approved AEDs:</p><p>1.12.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Study 304: A randomised (1:1:1) study of 388 patients experiencing a median of 12.0-14.3 seizures per 28 days who received perampanel 8 mg or perampanel 12 mg or placebo once daily (<a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/79/6/589.short"" target=""_blank"">French et al.

The Committee noted that the treatment paradigm in New Zealand as outlined by the supplier for POS and PGTC seizures is as described in 8.14.1 and 8.14.2 below, and considered that, although this may differ from that followed in routine practice for treatment of POS and PGTC (e.g. phenytoin is infrequently used, and valproate may not be used as an initial treatment), the treatment paradigm for patients with complex myoclonic epilepsy would be similar to that for patients experiencing POS:</p><p>1.7.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Patients with POS receive valproate, topiramate and levetiracetam as first, second and third-line AEDs, respectively; then carbamazepine, lamotrigine and/or phenytoin as fourth and fifth-line AEDs; then lacosamide as a sixth line treatment (all funded without restriction except lacosamide); and </p><p>1.7.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Patients with PGTC seizures receive first-line treatment with valproate, then second-line treatment includes the addition of, or substitution for, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate or clobazam (all funded without restriction). </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that refractory or drug resistant epilepsy is defined by the ILAE as not obtaining seizure freedom after adequate trials of two tolerated appropriate AED schedules; while the medical literature suggests up to 25% of patients with epilepsy would meet this definition, in New Zealand this could be about one-third of all patients with epilepsy (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/epilepsy-tag-paper-1-defining-epilepsy.docx"" target=""_blank"">Epilepsy Technical Advisory Group, Ministry of Health. 2017</a>).

The Committee considered that this treatment-related morbidity would have an impact on the health system resource due to the cost and complexity of managing side effects from perampanel, which would drive health system costs and be less likely to provide net savings to the health system. The Committee noted that there was no evidence to support the claim that perampanel could reduce health system resource usage, in particular hospital admission duration or emergency department visits. The Committee considered that well-controlled epilepsy resulting in freedom from seizures would be expected to convey a reduction in carer responsibility and an increase in patient employment, although no evidence was provided to quantify these possible benefits from treatment with perampanel.</p><p>1.30.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of perampanel as a fifth or sixth-line treatment for drug resistant epilepsy in patients aged 12 years and older may be reasonable, and that perampanel would be used in combination with other AEDs, especially newer AEDs.

The Subcommittee considered the results suggested that perampanel had similar efficacy to topiramate and levetiracetam, although the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios for all outcomes crossed the line of significance (1) and therefore it was uncertain whether the outcomes favoured perampanel or the comparator.

The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of perampanel compared with funded AEDs (eg levetiracetam and lamotrigine) was unclear due to an absence of directly comparative data. Members considered that, in general, the newer AEDs including perampanel appear to offer about 30% improvement in seizure reduction in the refractory PGTC and POS groups.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the safety profile of perampanel as reported in the clinical trial evidence included adverse events that are associated with some other AEDs, such as psychiatric events including suicidal ideation, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain which can be associated with other AEDs. The Subcommittee noted that carbamazepine interacts with perampanel, significantly decreasing the concentration of perampanel and that a specific dose titration is recommended to account for this.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that there was no clear evidence to suggest the use of therapeutic drug monitoring with perampanel. The Subcommittee considered that no additional monitoring (eg ECG or blood tests) would be required to manage a patient receiving perampanel treatment, although considered that elderly patients and those with psychiatric comorbidities would benefit from monitoring for psychiatric problems and falls. The Subcommittee considered that in current practice, patients initiated on a new AED and their GPs would be warned about the risk of ataxia and suicidality, with the GP having responsibility for identifying and differentiating any adverse drug effects from other symptoms. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that the effective dose of perampanel was 8 mg to 12 mg with up-titration of 2 mg every two weeks. The Subcommittee considered that the mean dose of perampanel reported by the Australian PBS of 5.82 mg was possibly too low to be used as a reasonable estimate for the New Zealand population. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear whether this mean dose was influenced by a small sample size, whether it was used in combination with enzyme inducing pharmaceuticals (in which case a higher dose of perampanel may be required), and in what proportions of adults and children it was used (where target dosing may differ). The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac staff could seek further information from the supplier and/or investigate the PBS data further to inform modelling of likely dose.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the availability of a range of AEDs with different mechanisms of action was valuable in supporting optimal treatment of people with epilepsy and considered that it appears greater benefits are achieved with combination use of AEDs that have different mechanisms of action compared with combination use of AEDs with similar action. The Subcommittee considered that perampanel would likely be used in combination with another AED(s) even if a patient experienced a reduction in seizure frequency. The Subcommittee considered that seizure freedom would be unlikely to be attained in highly refractory epilepsy and that clinicians would strive for best outcomes by continuing to trial treatments that may add some benefit. The Subcommittee considered that lacosamide usage reflected that this approach does occur in current practice. The Subcommittee noted that the magnitude of treatment benefit appears to deteriorate with subsequent treatments (</span><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2666189"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">Chen et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018;75:279-86</a><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">). The Subcommittee considered that concomitant use in 5% of patients was a reasonable estimate to use for the New Zealand patient population who would access perampanel, if funded, noting that Chen et al. reported in their study that a fourth AED or more provided less than 5% additional probability of seizure freedom.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria for PGE, POS and CME would together target all patients with refractory epilepsy, including people with refractory PGE who experience seizures other than GTC and myoclonic seizures. Members considered that this was a point of difference between the Special Authority criteria recommended by PTAC (which were derived from the supplier application) and the Subcommittee, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the Subcommittee-proposed criteria for patients with refractory PGE without GTC seizures, who were perhaps inadvertently excluded from the PTAC-recommended criteria for PGTC, could increase the number of PGE patients who might access perampanel for this indication by approximately 30% above the previous estimate for PGTC. The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate for the Special Authority renewal criteria for each of these three indications to be the same, as there was no apparent reason for them to differ. Members noted that Special Authority criteria may be required to manage fiscal risk, however, considered that a Special Authority would be time-consuming for clinicians and less relevant for managing fiscal risk if perampanel’s cost was similar to that of funded AEDs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for perampanel if it were to be funded in New Zealand for these indications. These PICOs capture key clinical aspects of the proposals and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. These PICOs are based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. These PICOs may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000002pSrO&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001sKI9"" alt=""image.png""></img></p>', 'fs': '<p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">PTAC and PTAC Subcommittees may differ in the advice they provide to Pharmac, including recommendations’ priority, due to the committees’ different, albeit complementary, roles, expertise, experience, and perspectives.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that perampanel is a first-in-class AMPA glutamate receptor antagonist. The Subcommittee noted that perampanel is an oral tablet taken once daily at night and is approved by Medsafe for the adjunctive treatment of adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age with epilepsy who have either POS with or without secondary generalised seizures, or PGTC seizures in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.</span></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">Primary generalised epilepsy</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that diagnostic terminology in epilepsy continues to evolve, resulting in differences in terminology within clinical practice and in clinical trials. This difficulty with the taxonomy of the disease can cause some confusion in describing types of epilepsy and seizures. The Subcommittee noted that generalised tonic-clonic convulsions may be focal onset (also known as secondarily generalised) or primarily generalised. The Subcommittee noted that childhood onset epilepsy syndromes often have generalised seizure types (absences, myoclonic seizures, and generalised tonic-clonic </span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;"">convulsions</span><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">). The Subcommittee considered that the terms primary generalised epilepsy (PGE) or idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) would better to describe the patient groups referred to by PTAC and by the supplier applicant as experiencing PGTC seizures; members noted that this did not necessarily alter the size or characteristics of the patient population in question, rather, it more accurately described it.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that people with PGE or IGE typically have childhood epilepsy that may continue into adulthood and many have a high health need. The Subcommittee considered that primary generalised seizure types may be worsened by some anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) therefore generally only sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate are used for their funded treatment - all of which have reported efficacy in treating people with generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. The Subcommittee noted that clobazam, clonazepam and ethosuximide may also have a role in some generalised seizure types.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted the evidence for perampanel in primary generalised epilepsy </span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;"">included</span><span style=""font-size: 14px;""> the placebo-controlled Study 332 in 162 patients with IGE with PGTC seizures (</span><a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/85/11/950.long"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">French et al.

The Subcommittee considered the results suggested that perampanel had similar efficacy to topiramate and levetiracetam, although the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios for all outcomes crossed the line of significance (1) and therefore it was uncertain whether the outcomes favoured perampanel or the comparator. Members noted that perampanel was associated with higher withdrawals due to adverse events. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would target patients with GTC seizures and seizures of any type.

Members considered that this amendment would also encompass the majority of the patients with complex myoclonic epilepsy (CME); another group being considered for perampanel treatment. The Subcommittee otherwise agreed with the criteria recommended by PTAC for this group, and therefore considered the following Special Authority criteria would be appropriate for targeting funding to this group:</span></p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">Initial application – (primary generalised epilepsy).

The Subcommittee considered that, based on the evidence of perampanel having similar efficacy as lacosamide, it would be appropriate for perampanel to sit alongside lacosamide in treatment paradigm for this group. However, the Subcommittee considered that perampanel could displace lacosamide (ie lacosamide could be used later in the paradigm) if perampanel provided this similar benefit at a lower cost. The Subcommittee considered there could be a desire to use perampanel as early as possible in the treatment of POS but considered that there was presently insufficient directly comparable evidence to inform the appropriateness of its earlier use.

The Subcommittee considered that the body of evidence for perampanel in epilepsy suggested that people with CME would receive a benefit from treatment with perampanel similar to that received by patients with PGTC, noting that about 40% of participants of Study 332 in PGTC experienced myoclonic seizures (</span><a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/85/11/950.long"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">French et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of perampanel compared with funded AEDs (eg levetiracetam and lamotrigine) was unclear due to an absence of directly comparative data. Members considered that, in general, the newer AEDs including perampanel appear to offer about 30% improvement in seizure reduction in the refractory PGTC and POS groups.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the safety profile of perampanel as reported in the clinical trial evidence included adverse events that are associated with some other AEDs, such as psychiatric events including suicidal ideation, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain which can be associated with other AEDs. The Subcommittee noted that carbamazepine interacts with perampanel, significantly decreasing the concentration of perampanel and that a specific dose titration is recommended to account for this.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that there was no clear evidence to suggest the use of therapeutic drug monitoring with perampanel. The Subcommittee considered that no additional monitoring (eg ECG or blood tests) would be required to manage a patient receiving perampanel treatment, although considered that elderly patients and those with psychiatric comorbidities would benefit from monitoring for psychiatric problems and falls. The Subcommittee considered that in current practice, patients initiated on a new AED and their GPs would be warned about the risk of ataxia and suicidality, with the GP having responsibility for identifying and differentiating any adverse drug effects from other symptoms. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that the effective dose of perampanel was 8 mg to 12 mg with up-titration of 2 mg every two weeks. The Subcommittee considered that the mean dose of perampanel reported by the Australian PBS of 5.82 mg was possibly too low to be used as a reasonable estimate for the New Zealand population. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear whether this mean dose was influenced by a small sample size, whether it was used in combination with enzyme inducing pharmaceuticals (in which case a higher dose of perampanel may be required), and in what proportions of adults and children it was used (where target dosing may differ). The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac staff could seek further information from the supplier and/or investigate the PBS data further to inform modelling of likely dose.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the availability of a range of AEDs with different mechanisms of action was valuable in supporting optimal treatment of people with epilepsy and considered that it appears greater benefits are achieved with combination use of AEDs that have different mechanisms of action compared with combination use of AEDs with similar action. The Subcommittee considered that perampanel would likely be used in combination with another AED(s) even if a patient experienced a reduction in seizure frequency. The Subcommittee considered that seizure freedom would be unlikely to be attained in highly refractory epilepsy and that clinicians would strive for best outcomes by continuing to trial treatments that may add some benefit. The Subcommittee considered that lacosamide usage reflected that this approach does occur in current practice. The Subcommittee noted that the magnitude of treatment benefit appears to deteriorate with subsequent treatments (</span><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2666189"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">Chen et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018;75:279-86</a><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">). The Subcommittee considered that concomitant use in 5% of patients was a reasonable estimate to use for the New Zealand patient population who would access perampanel, if funded, noting that Chen et al. reported in their study that a fourth AED or more provided less than 5% additional probability of seizure freedom.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria for PGE, POS and CME would together target all patients with refractory epilepsy, including people with refractory PGE who experience seizures other than GTC and myoclonic seizures. Members considered that this was a point of difference between the Special Authority criteria recommended by PTAC (which were derived from the supplier application) and the Subcommittee, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the Subcommittee-proposed criteria for patients with refractory PGE without GTC seizures, who were perhaps inadvertently excluded from the PTAC-recommended criteria for PGTC, could increase the number of PGE patients who might access perampanel for this indication by approximately 30% above the previous estimate for PGTC. The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate for the Special Authority renewal criteria for each of these three indications to be the same, as there was no apparent reason for them to differ. Members noted that Special Authority criteria may be required to manage fiscal risk, however, considered that a Special Authority would be time-consuming for clinicians and less relevant for managing fiscal risk if perampanel’s cost was similar to that of funded AEDs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for perampanel if it were to be funded in New Zealand for these indications. These PICOs capture key clinical aspects of the proposals and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. These PICOs are based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. These PICOs may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000002pSrO&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001sKI9"" alt=""image.png""></img></p>', 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee noted that Pharmac had received the following applications for perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy:</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style=""color: black;"">An application from Eisai New Zealand Ltd for the adjunctive ie additional add-on, treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary generalised seizures in adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age with epilepsy;

The Subcommittee noted that perampanel is an oral tablet taken once daily at night and is approved by Medsafe for the adjunctive treatment of adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age with epilepsy who have either POS with or without secondary generalised seizures, or PGTC seizures in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.</span></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">Primary generalised epilepsy</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that diagnostic terminology in epilepsy continues to evolve, resulting in differences in terminology within clinical practice and in clinical trials. This difficulty with the taxonomy of the disease can cause some confusion in describing types of epilepsy and seizures. The Subcommittee noted that generalised tonic-clonic convulsions may be focal onset (also known as secondarily generalised) or primarily generalised. The Subcommittee noted that childhood onset epilepsy syndromes often have generalised seizure types (absences, myoclonic seizures, and generalised tonic-clonic </span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;"">convulsions</span><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">). The Subcommittee considered that the terms primary generalised epilepsy (PGE) or idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) would better to describe the patient groups referred to by PTAC and by the supplier applicant as experiencing PGTC seizures; members noted that this did not necessarily alter the size or characteristics of the patient population in question, rather, it more accurately described it.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that people with PGE or IGE typically have childhood epilepsy that may continue into adulthood and many have a high health need. The Subcommittee considered that primary generalised seizure types may be worsened by some anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) therefore generally only sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate are used for their funded treatment - all of which have reported efficacy in treating people with generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. The Subcommittee noted that clobazam, clonazepam and ethosuximide may also have a role in some generalised seizure types.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted the evidence for perampanel in primary generalised epilepsy </span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;"">included</span><span style=""font-size: 14px;""> the placebo-controlled Study 332 in 162 patients with IGE with PGTC seizures (</span><a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/85/11/950.long"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">French et al.

The Subcommittee considered the results suggested that perampanel had similar efficacy to topiramate and levetiracetam, although the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios for all outcomes crossed the line of significance (1) and therefore it was uncertain whether the outcomes favoured perampanel or the comparator. Members noted that perampanel was associated with higher withdrawals due to adverse events. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria would target patients with GTC seizures and seizures of any type.

Members considered that this amendment would also encompass the majority of the patients with complex myoclonic epilepsy (CME); another group being considered for perampanel treatment.

However, the Subcommittee considered that perampanel could displace lacosamide (ie lacosamide could be used later in the paradigm) if perampanel provided this similar benefit at a lower cost. The Subcommittee considered there could be a desire to use perampanel as early as possible in the treatment of POS but considered that there was presently insufficient directly comparable evidence to inform the appropriateness of its earlier use.

Overall, the Subcommittee considered that, based on the Finnish prevalence data, the group with rare epilepsies (including other myoclonic epilepsies) that are refractory to funded AEDs was small and would consist of approximately 300 people in New Zealand. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The </span><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">Subcommittee</span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;""> considered that most patients with refractory JME and most patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsies would be within the group targeted by the supplier’s PGTC definition. The Subcommittee noted that this differed from PTAC’s view of where the patient group with complex myoclonic epilepsy fits relative to the supplier’s proposed PGTC and POS groups. The Subcommittee considered that the reason for this difference was the nuanced and evolving nomenclature in epilepsy but confirmed that most patients with CME would be a subset of the patients with IGE/primary epilepsy with refractory epilepsy, and not a subset of the POS group. The Subcommittee considered that some patients with CME would not have experienced a major, generalised tonic clonic seizure but instead would experience frequent myoclonic jerks.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that patients with CME generally receive the same current </span><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">treatments</span><span style=""font-size: 14px; color: black;""> as IGE / PGTC following the same treatment sequence (ie sodium valproate, topiramate, levetiracetam and lamotrigine). The Subcommittee noted that some sodium channel blockers (except lamotrigine) and some other AEDs (eg carbamazepine or phenytoin sodium) can worsen seizures in patients with CME and therefore would not be used for this indication; based on this the Subcommittee considered it inappropriate for the Special Authority criteria to require prior treatment with carbamazepine or phenytoin sodium in patients with CME. The Subcommittee considered that in practice some clinicians likely prescribe treatment for patients who have not trialed all prerequisite treatments because some of those treatments would not be clinically appropriate for individual patients. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted the evidence for perampanel for the treatment of CME as described by PTAC in its </span><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-18-PTAC-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">February 2021</a><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;""> meeting record. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence reported benefits with perampanel in this patient population and although the data were from small studies, members considered this was not unexpected for these rare conditions. The Subcommittee considered that the body of evidence for perampanel in epilepsy suggested that people with CME would receive a benefit from treatment with perampanel similar to that received by patients with PGTC, noting that about 40% of participants of Study 332 in PGTC experienced myoclonic seizures (</span><a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/85/11/950.long"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">French et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the relative efficacy of perampanel compared with funded AEDs (eg levetiracetam and lamotrigine) was unclear due to an absence of directly comparative data. Members considered that, in general, the newer AEDs including perampanel appear to offer about 30% improvement in seizure reduction in the refractory PGTC and POS groups.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the safety profile of perampanel as reported in the clinical trial evidence included adverse events that are associated with some other AEDs, such as psychiatric events including suicidal ideation, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain which can be associated with other AEDs. The Subcommittee noted that carbamazepine interacts with perampanel, significantly decreasing the concentration of perampanel and that a specific dose titration is recommended to account for this.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that there was no clear evidence to suggest the use of therapeutic drug monitoring with perampanel. The Subcommittee considered that no additional monitoring (eg ECG or blood tests) would be required to manage a patient receiving perampanel treatment, although considered that elderly patients and those with psychiatric comorbidities would benefit from monitoring for psychiatric problems and falls. The Subcommittee considered that in current practice, patients initiated on a new AED and their GPs would be warned about the risk of ataxia and suicidality, with the GP having responsibility for identifying and differentiating any adverse drug effects from other symptoms. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee noted that the effective dose of perampanel was 8 mg to 12 mg with up-titration of 2 mg every two weeks. The Subcommittee considered that the mean dose of perampanel reported by the Australian PBS of 5.82 mg was possibly too low to be used as a reasonable estimate for the New Zealand population. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear whether this mean dose was influenced by a small sample size, whether it was used in combination with enzyme inducing pharmaceuticals (in which case a higher dose of perampanel may be required), and in what proportions of adults and children it was used (where target dosing may differ). The Subcommittee considered that Pharmac staff could seek further information from the supplier and/or investigate the PBS data further to inform modelling of likely dose.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the availability of a range of AEDs with different mechanisms of action was valuable in supporting optimal treatment of people with epilepsy and considered that it appears greater benefits are achieved with combination use of AEDs that have different mechanisms of action compared with combination use of AEDs with similar action. The Subcommittee considered that perampanel would likely be used in combination with another AED(s) even if a patient experienced a reduction in seizure frequency. The Subcommittee considered that seizure freedom would be unlikely to be attained in highly refractory epilepsy and that clinicians would strive for best outcomes by continuing to trial treatments that may add some benefit. The Subcommittee considered that lacosamide usage reflected that this approach does occur in current practice. The Subcommittee noted that the magnitude of treatment benefit appears to deteriorate with subsequent treatments (</span><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2666189"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: blue; font-size: 14px;"">Chen et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018;75:279-86</a><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">). The Subcommittee considered that concomitant use in 5% of patients was a reasonable estimate to use for the New Zealand patient population who would access perampanel, if funded, noting that Chen et al. reported in their study that a fourth AED or more provided less than 5% additional probability of seizure freedom.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Subcommittee considered that the proposed Special Authority criteria for PGE, POS and CME would together target all patients with refractory epilepsy, including people with refractory PGE who experience seizures other than GTC and myoclonic seizures. Members considered that this was a point of difference between the Special Authority criteria recommended by PTAC (which were derived from the supplier application) and the Subcommittee, respectively. The Subcommittee considered that the Subcommittee-proposed criteria for patients with refractory PGE without GTC seizures, who were perhaps inadvertently excluded from the PTAC-recommended criteria for PGTC, could increase the number of PGE patients who might access perampanel for this indication by approximately 30% above the previous estimate for PGTC. The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate for the Special Authority renewal criteria for each of these three indications to be the same, as there was no apparent reason for them to differ. Members noted that Special Authority criteria may be required to manage fiscal risk, however, considered that a Special Authority would be time-consuming for clinicians and less relevant for managing fiscal risk if perampanel’s cost was similar to that of funded AEDs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 14px;"">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for perampanel if it were to be funded in New Zealand for these indications.
