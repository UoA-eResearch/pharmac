Members were made aware of a single case report of disseminated herpes zoster infection in a patient receiving benralizumab and considered that such infections like this were rare in immunocompetent individuals; however, this was not reviewed in detail.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that any benefit could decrease over time if neutralising anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were to develop. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear how frequently neutralising ADAs occur in patients who have received mepolizumab, although ADAs have been detected and there is evidence out to 5-years with mepolizumab suggesting that there is no loss of therapeutic effect. Members considered that patients could consider a switch from one medicine to another (i.e. mepolizumab to benralizumab, or vice versa) if neutralising ADAs developed.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that increased incidence of fever, arthralgia and nausea were reported after treatment with benralizumab compared with placebo. The Subcommittee considered that there is additional uncertainty and risk associated with the clinical trials\u2019 design due to being powered for a reduction in exacerbations, but not for hospital attendances, symptoms or rare safety signals. However, the Subcommittee considered that there was evidence of a consistent reduction in the rate of exacerbations, and considered that this may be a good surrogate for hospitalisation rates, in the absence of evidence for hospitalisations.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence base for benralizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma was limited to a relatively small number of placebo-controlled trials that were included in many analyses and that had not investigated effects on quality of life in any detail. The Subcommittee noted there were no head-to-head trials of biologic agents for severe asthma, and considered that appraisal of the current evidence is reliant on indirect comparison which inherently has high degrees of uncertainty. The Subcommittee considered that direct comparative evidence in the form of a direct head-to-head trial between benralizumab and mepolizumab would not be forthcoming in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that evidence suggested that the patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who received the greatest benefits from treatment with benralizumab had high eosinophil counts (\u2265300 cells/\u00b5L), experienced more frequent exacerbations, had nasal polyps, had persistent airway obstruction (FEV1 &lt;65%) or were requiring high doses of oral corticosteroids. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population who may receive the greatest benefit from benralizumab is the same population who are currently eligible for mepolizumab. However, the Subcommittee considered that participants in the benralizumab clinical trials had less severe disease than those patients included in the mepolizumab clinical trials (previously reviewed by the Subcommittee for in August 2017 and which reported a 61% reduction in exacerbations with mepolizumab), although the Hawthorne effect would have influenced the exacerbation rate of the benralizumab trial\u2019s placebo group.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered it would be reasonable for benralizumab to have the same Special Authority criteria as mepolizumab, which defines a similar patient group and similar predictors of response to treatment, including appropriate criteria regarding blood eosinophil counts and ACT scores.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that both benralizumab and mepolizumab would likely be equally effective in a significant proportion of patients with severe asthma, but that some patients may only benefit from one or the other and the outcomes experienced by individual patients may vary. However, members considered that there is no evidence to support efficacy of one treatment over the other in the same patient.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the funding application requested 8-weekly dosing of benralizumab and considered that this dosing regimen would be appropriate, given the clinical trial evidence suggesting similar efficacy between the two dosing regimens.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that after the initial 4-weekly dosing, the 8-weekly dosing and formulation (prefilled syringe) of benralizumab offered benefits to the health system which would administer this treatment at a cost of approximately $500 if given in a hospital day stay unit, although members noted that some centres are shifting this treatment from day stay units into general practice or to patient self-administered treatment in the community.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the 8-weekly dosing regimen of benralizumab could be preferable to the ongoing 4-weekly administration of mepolizumab, and noted that patients who self-administer treatment with mepolizumab would be self-funding water for dilution at this time.

However, the Subcommittee noted that Medsafe approval and availability of prefilled syringe and autoinjector formulations of mepolizumab is expected in 2021.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimates of eligible patient uptake for benralizumab of [withheld]% at 1 year up to [withheld]% after 5 years, based on the proposed Special Authority criteria, were reasonable, although this could depend on marketing activity. The Subcommittee considered that patients who were currently receiving treatment with mepolizumab would be unlikely to change to benralizumab, if funded, unless they experienced a waning response on mepolizumab.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients experiencing a reaction to one biologic agent or who have experienced loss of efficacy may choose to switch to another agent with a different mechanism of action, however, switching patients with stable disease onto a different biologic treatment could expose patients to significant risks (e.g. a patient could lose disease control and may experience a potentially life-threatening exacerbation).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence for concurrent use of biologics targeting different pathways (e.g. benralizumab and mepolizumab), and considered that as most clinicians would reserve an agent with a different mechanism of action for use when a patient experiences loss of efficacy, this would not need to be incorporated into the funding criteria.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was an absence of evidence for benralizumab as a second-line biologic, although members were aware of evidence for second-line use of other biologics for severe eosinophilic asthma.

The Subcommittee also noted that there were network meta-analyses indirectly comparing the outcomes in severe asthma with the use of different biologics (i.e. benralizumab and mepolizumab) and considered that these analyses suggested perhaps equal efficacy between benralizumab and mepolizumab in reducing exacerbations when adjusted for patient-related predictors of response (Bourdin et al. 2018; Busse et al. 2019; Ramonell and Iftikhar. 2020).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the consequences of reduced blood eosinophils and basophils were not fully understood and that some safety signals may not yet have been identified in the clinical trials (e.g. relating to possible cardioprotective and cancer-preventative effects of these blood cells), and that they may be important in responding to helminths. However, the Subcommittee noted that these trials were not powered for safety follow-up and low-frequency events may only be identified post-marketing. Members were made aware of a single case report of disseminated herpes zoster infection in a patient receiving benralizumab and considered that such infections like this were rare in immunocompetent individuals; however, this was not reviewed in detail.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that any benefit could decrease over time if neutralising anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were to develop. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear how frequently neutralising ADAs occur in patients who have received mepolizumab, although ADAs have been detected and there is evidence out to 5-years with mepolizumab suggesting that there is no loss of therapeutic effect. Members considered that patients could consider a switch from one medicine to another (i.e. mepolizumab to benralizumab, or vice versa) if neutralising ADAs developed.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that increased incidence of fever, arthralgia and nausea were reported after treatment with benralizumab compared with placebo. The Subcommittee considered that there is additional uncertainty and risk associated with the clinical trials\u2019 design due to being powered for a reduction in exacerbations, but not for hospital attendances, symptoms or rare safety signals. However, the Subcommittee considered that there was evidence of a consistent reduction in the rate of exacerbations, and considered that this may be a good surrogate for hospitalisation rates, in the absence of evidence for hospitalisations.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence base for benralizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma was limited to a relatively small number of placebo-controlled trials that were included in many analyses and that had not investigated effects on quality of life in any detail. The Subcommittee noted there were no head-to-head trials of biologic agents for severe asthma, and considered that appraisal of the current evidence is reliant on indirect comparison which inherently has high degrees of uncertainty. The Subcommittee considered that direct comparative evidence in the form of a direct head-to-head trial between benralizumab and mepolizumab would not be forthcoming in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that evidence suggested that the patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who received the greatest benefits from treatment with benralizumab had high eosinophil counts (\u2265300 cells/\u00b5L), experienced more frequent exacerbations, had nasal polyps, had persistent airway obstruction (FEV1 &lt;65%) or were requiring high doses of oral corticosteroids. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population who may receive the greatest benefit from benralizumab is the same population who are currently eligible for mepolizumab. However, the Subcommittee considered that participants in the benralizumab clinical trials had less severe disease than those patients included in the mepolizumab clinical trials (previously reviewed by the Subcommittee for in August 2017 and which reported a 61% reduction in exacerbations with mepolizumab), although the Hawthorne effect would have influenced the exacerbation rate of the benralizumab trial\u2019s placebo group.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered it would be reasonable for benralizumab to have the same Special Authority criteria as mepolizumab, which defines a similar patient group and similar predictors of response to treatment, including appropriate criteria regarding blood eosinophil counts and ACT scores.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that both benralizumab and mepolizumab would likely be equally effective in a significant proportion of patients with severe asthma, but that some patients may only benefit from one or the other and the outcomes experienced by individual patients may vary. However, members considered that there is no evidence to support efficacy of one treatment over the other in the same patient.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the funding application requested 8-weekly dosing of benralizumab and considered that this dosing regimen would be appropriate, given the clinical trial evidence suggesting similar efficacy between the two dosing regimens.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that after the initial 4-weekly dosing, the 8-weekly dosing and formulation (prefilled syringe) of benralizumab offered benefits to the health system which would administer this treatment at a cost of approximately $500 if given in a hospital day stay unit, although members noted that some centres are shifting this treatment from day stay units into general practice or to patient self-administered treatment in the community.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the 8-weekly dosing regimen of benralizumab could be preferable to the ongoing 4-weekly administration of mepolizumab, and noted that patients who self-administer treatment with mepolizumab would be self-funding water for dilution at this time. The Subcommittee considered that these differing treatment frequencies should be taken into account when modelling treatment costs of benralizumab and mepolizumab.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if multiple prefilled syringe options were available, patient preference regarding administration frequency would be a key factor driving uptake, rather than health costs, and clinician familiarity with an existing funded treatment may also be a factor. However, the Subcommittee noted that Medsafe approval and availability of prefilled syringe and autoinjector formulations of mepolizumab is expected in 2021.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimates of eligible patient uptake for benralizumab of [withheld]% at 1 year up to [withheld]% after 5 years, based on the proposed Special Authority criteria, were reasonable, although this could depend on marketing activity. The Subcommittee considered that patients who were currently receiving treatment with mepolizumab would be unlikely to change to benralizumab, if funded, unless they experienced a waning response on mepolizumab.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients experiencing a reaction to one biologic agent or who have experienced loss of efficacy may choose to switch to another agent with a different mechanism of action, however, switching patients with stable disease onto a different biologic treatment could expose patients to significant risks (e.g. a patient could lose disease control and may experience a potentially life-threatening exacerbation).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence for concurrent use of biologics targeting different pathways (e.g. benralizumab and mepolizumab), and considered that as most clinicians would reserve an agent with a different mechanism of action for use when a patient experiences loss of efficacy, this would not need to be incorporated into the funding criteria.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was an absence of evidence for benralizumab as a second-line biologic, although members were aware of evidence for second-line use of other biologics for severe eosinophilic asthma. The Subcommittee considered that some use of benralizumab as a second-line treatment for patients who did not receive a response from mepolizumab would be likely if funded.</p>",

The Subcommittee also noted that there were network meta-analyses indirectly comparing the outcomes in severe asthma with the use of different biologics (i.e. benralizumab and mepolizumab) and considered that these analyses suggested perhaps equal efficacy between benralizumab and mepolizumab in reducing exacerbations when adjusted for patient-related predictors of response (Bourdin et al. 2018; Busse et al. 2019; Ramonell and Iftikhar. 2020).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the consequences of reduced blood eosinophils and basophils were not fully understood and that some safety signals may not yet have been identified in the clinical trials (e.g. relating to possible cardioprotective and cancer-preventative effects of these blood cells), and that they may be important in responding to helminths. However, the Subcommittee noted that these trials were not powered for safety follow-up and low-frequency events may only be identified post-marketing. Members were made aware of a single case report of disseminated herpes zoster infection in a patient receiving benralizumab and considered that such infections like this were rare in immunocompetent individuals; however, this was not reviewed in detail.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that any benefit could decrease over time if neutralising anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were to develop. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was unclear how frequently neutralising ADAs occur in patients who have received mepolizumab, although ADAs have been detected and there is evidence out to 5-years with mepolizumab suggesting that there is no loss of therapeutic effect. Members considered that patients could consider a switch from one medicine to another (i.e. mepolizumab to benralizumab, or vice versa) if neutralising ADAs developed.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that increased incidence of fever, arthralgia and nausea were reported after treatment with benralizumab compared with placebo. The Subcommittee considered that there is additional uncertainty and risk associated with the clinical trials\u2019 design due to being powered for a reduction in exacerbations, but not for hospital attendances, symptoms or rare safety signals. However, the Subcommittee considered that there was evidence of a consistent reduction in the rate of exacerbations, and considered that this may be a good surrogate for hospitalisation rates, in the absence of evidence for hospitalisations.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence base for benralizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma was limited to a relatively small number of placebo-controlled trials that were included in many analyses and that had not investigated effects on quality of life in any detail. The Subcommittee noted there were no head-to-head trials of biologic agents for severe asthma, and considered that appraisal of the current evidence is reliant on indirect comparison which inherently has high degrees of uncertainty. The Subcommittee considered that direct comparative evidence in the form of a direct head-to-head trial between benralizumab and mepolizumab would not be forthcoming in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that evidence suggested that the patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who received the greatest benefits from treatment with benralizumab had high eosinophil counts (\u2265300 cells/\u00b5L), experienced more frequent exacerbations, had nasal polyps, had persistent airway obstruction (FEV1 &lt;65%) or were requiring high doses of oral corticosteroids. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population who may receive the greatest benefit from benralizumab is the same population who are currently eligible for mepolizumab. However, the Subcommittee considered that participants in the benralizumab clinical trials had less severe disease than those patients included in the mepolizumab clinical trials (previously reviewed by the Subcommittee for in August 2017 and which reported a 61% reduction in exacerbations with mepolizumab), although the Hawthorne effect would have influenced the exacerbation rate of the benralizumab trial\u2019s placebo group.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered it would be reasonable for benralizumab to have the same Special Authority criteria as mepolizumab, which defines a similar patient group and similar predictors of response to treatment, including appropriate criteria regarding blood eosinophil counts and ACT scores.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that both benralizumab and mepolizumab would likely be equally effective in a significant proportion of patients with severe asthma, but that some patients may only benefit from one or the other and the outcomes experienced by individual patients may vary.
