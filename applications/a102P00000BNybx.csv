The Committee noted that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in the composite of CV death and heart failure hospitalisation compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]=0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.82; I2=0%; P&lt;0.00001).

The Committee considered an absolute reduction in hospitalisation represents a meaningful outcome due to the severe impact it has on those with heart failure as well as their family/whānau. The Committee considered that, while PTAC noted that hospitalisation provides an optimal setting to review medication efficacy, that it is also an indicator of poor overall clinical management of the condition and that a hospital environment is generally not conducive to patient respite and wellbeing. The Committee considered that heart failure-related hospitalisations occur in situations where patients are inadequately managed on their current medication and require admission to a coronary care unit.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the trial evidence suggested that empagliflozin provided little overall benefit on reducing mortality. However, the Committee considered that the lack of a statistically significant all-cause mortality benefit in the EMPEROR trial was likely a function of underpowering with small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. The Committee also considered that these trials were conducted in relatively low-risk patients who were already receiving standard heart failure treatment in addition to empagliflozin, both features further lessening baseline event rates and thus power to detect statistically significant differences. The Committee considered had these trials been conducted in a higher-risk population, absolute reductions in all-cause mortality with empagliflozin may have been greater. The Committee noted that DAPA-HF and the meta-analyses conducted by Zannad et al. and Pandey et al. each reported a benefit in reducing all-cause death and cardiovascular death. The Committee also considered that the Empire HF study reported outcomes based on a surrogate marker (NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]), which is a poor indicator in measuring the benefit of empagliflozin in those with HFrEF.

The Committee considered an absolute reduction in hospitalisation represents a meaningful outcome due to the severe impact it has on those with heart failure as well as their family/whānau. The Committee considered that, while PTAC noted that hospitalisation provides an optimal setting to review medication efficacy, that it is also an indicator of poor overall clinical management of the condition and that a hospital environment is generally not conducive to patient respite and wellbeing. The Committee considered that heart failure-related hospitalisations occur in situations where patients are inadequately managed on their current medication and require admission to a coronary care unit.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the trial evidence suggested that empagliflozin provided little overall benefit on reducing mortality. However, the Committee considered that the lack of a statistically significant all-cause mortality benefit in the EMPEROR trial was likely a function of underpowering with small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. The Committee also considered that these trials were conducted in relatively low-risk patients who were already receiving standard heart failure treatment in addition to empagliflozin, both features further lessening baseline event rates and thus power to detect statistically significant differences. The Committee considered had these trials been conducted in a higher-risk population, absolute reductions in all-cause mortality with empagliflozin may have been greater. The Committee noted that DAPA-HF and the meta-analyses conducted by Zannad et al. and Pandey et al. each reported a benefit in reducing all-cause death and cardiovascular death. The Committee also considered that the Empire HF study reported outcomes based on a surrogate marker (NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]), which is a poor indicator in measuring the benefit of empagliflozin in those with HFrEF. The Committee also considered the positive impact empagliflozin has on renal function.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the 10mg once-daily dose of empagliflozin provides a suitability advantage compared to currently funded treatments, for which doses may be more frequent and multiple physician visits may be required to titrate the patient to the optimal dose. The Committee considered that these simplified dosing requirements in combination with the favourable side effect profile of empagliflozin contribute to improved adherence with treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if funded access were to be widened, the number of those eligible to receive empagliflozin for HFrEF is uncertain. The Committee considered that it would be appropriate to estimate patient numbers based on the number of those currently receiving sacubitril/valsartan, with approximately two thirds of this patient population estimated to be symptomatic and therefore eligible to receive empagliflozin if funded access were to be widened. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that an additional subgroup of patients not currently receiving sacubitril with valsartan would also be eligible for empagliflozin and that it was reasonable to assume this group was roughly 10% of the size of the group currently receiving sacubitril with valsartan. The Committee also considered that patient number estimates would need to account for those with type 2 diabetes who are already being treated with empagliflozin, and those with severe renal impairment for which empagliflozin is contraindicated. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would be prescribed to those who have not experienced adequate symptom control with currently funded treatment options.

The Committee noted that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in the composite of CV death and heart failure hospitalisation compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]=0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.82; I2=0%; P&lt;0.00001). It was noted that this was consistent in LVEF sub-groups (P-for-interaction=0.57) as well as in sub-groups of patients with and without diabetes mellitus at baseline (P-for-interaction=0.81) (LVEF ≤40% HR=0.74, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.81, I2=0%; LVEF &gt;40% HR=0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89, I2=0%). The Committee noted that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced the hazard of cardiovascular death (HR=0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97, I2=0%, P&lt;0.00001) and total heart failure hospitalisation (relative risk=0.71, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.76, I2=0%, P&lt;0.00001) (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ehf2.13805"" target=""_blank"">Pandey et al.

The Committee considered an absolute reduction in hospitalisation represents a meaningful outcome due to the severe impact it has on those with heart failure as well as their family/whānau. The Committee considered that, while PTAC noted that hospitalisation provides an optimal setting to review medication efficacy, that it is also an indicator of poor overall clinical management of the condition and that a hospital environment is generally not conducive to patient respite and wellbeing. The Committee considered that heart failure-related hospitalisations occur in situations where patients are inadequately managed on their current medication and require admission to a coronary care unit.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the trial evidence suggested that empagliflozin provided little overall benefit on reducing mortality. However, the Committee considered that the lack of a statistically significant all-cause mortality benefit in the EMPEROR trial was likely a function of underpowering with small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. The Committee also considered that these trials were conducted in relatively low-risk patients who were already receiving standard heart failure treatment in addition to empagliflozin, both features further lessening baseline event rates and thus power to detect statistically significant differences. The Committee considered had these trials been conducted in a higher-risk population, absolute reductions in all-cause mortality with empagliflozin may have been greater. The Committee noted that DAPA-HF and the meta-analyses conducted by Zannad et al. and Pandey et al. each reported a benefit in reducing all-cause death and cardiovascular death. The Committee also considered that the Empire HF study reported outcomes based on a surrogate marker (NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]), which is a poor indicator in measuring the benefit of empagliflozin in those with HFrEF. The Committee also considered the positive impact empagliflozin has on renal function.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the 10mg once-daily dose of empagliflozin provides a suitability advantage compared to currently funded treatments, for which doses may be more frequent and multiple physician visits may be required to titrate the patient to the optimal dose. The Committee considered that these simplified dosing requirements in combination with the favourable side effect profile of empagliflozin contribute to improved adherence with treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if funded access were to be widened, the number of those eligible to receive empagliflozin for HFrEF is uncertain. The Committee considered that it would be appropriate to estimate patient numbers based on the number of those currently receiving sacubitril/valsartan, with approximately two thirds of this patient population estimated to be symptomatic and therefore eligible to receive empagliflozin if funded access were to be widened. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that an additional subgroup of patients not currently receiving sacubitril with valsartan would also be eligible for empagliflozin and that it was reasonable to assume this group was roughly 10% of the size of the group currently receiving sacubitril with valsartan. The Committee also considered that patient number estimates would need to account for those with type 2 diabetes who are already being treated with empagliflozin, and those with severe renal impairment for which empagliflozin is contraindicated. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would be prescribed to those who have not experienced adequate symptom control with currently funded treatment options.
