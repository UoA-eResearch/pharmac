The Committee noted that major manifestations of PsA include inflammatory arthropathy and enthesitis usually associated with skin manifestations. The Committee noted that PsA is one of several closely related inflammatory conditions that are collectively grouped under the term spondyloarthritis; this group also includes ankylosing spondylitis, acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The Committee noted that PsA is associated with higher mortality and considered that the risk of mortality in PsA is greater for patients more active disease.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that PsA impacts on a patient’s function/activities and employment, which in turn impacts their family and whānau<span style=""color: black;"">, particularly as the disease progresses and the individual’s pain and mobility worsen</span><em>.</em> The Committee considered that there was reasonable evidence for the health needs of patients with PsA, however, that there was no specific evidence of a disproportionate impact from PsA on Māori, Pacific peoples, or other groups experiencing health disparities.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the aim of treatment for PsA is to reduce the functional and systemic impact of the disease. The Committee noted that there is no agreed New Zealand-specific treatment paradigm for PsA, and was made aware of recent international guidelines from 2018 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30499246/"" target=""_blank"">Singh et al. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2019;71:5-32</a>) and 2020 (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/59/Supplement_1/i37/5802853"" target=""_blank"">Ogdie et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59(Suppl_1):i37-i46</a>) which include treatment guidelines and recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). The Committee was made aware that the sequence of treatments for PsA in these guidelines commences with physical therapies followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatories according to a ‘treat to target’ principle, and that following this treatment may be escalated to the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or to a biologic DMARD (bDMARD). The Committee noted that funded bDMARD options include tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, ie adalimumab or etanercept) or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL17i) such as secukinumab, and that these may also be used in combination with a conventional DMARD. The Committee was made aware that subsequent options available internationally with different mechanisms of action to TNFi and IL17i may include upadacitinib, tofacitinib, abatacept or guselkumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adalimumab would be the most common first-line bDMARD in New Zealand due to its benefits for skin and joint disease and considered that the disease-related threshold to access funded bDMARDs in New Zealand is high and would include patients with severe and erosive disease (the Special Authority criteria for adalimumab currently requiring 15 swollen or four major joints with persistent symptoms of poorly controlled active disease to be eligible). The Committee noted that secukinumab was funded in 2021 for PsA and that Pharmac’s Special Authority data reports 20-25% of secukinumab patients with PsA had not had a prior biologic. The Committee considered this could be due to patients who received adalimumab in the past having a long delay before starting secukinumab. The Committee also considered that first-line use of secukinumab would be unlikely to increase over time given the preference for a first-line anti-TNF and the residual uncertainty about the optimal treatment sequencing in PsA. The Committee considered that the use of secukinumab first-line would be unlikely to increase, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s views on secukinumab first-line use. The Committee considered that some patients would receive treatment with a TNFi then proceed to secukinumab second-line and then receive another TNFi in the third line, although some might receive a different TNFi in the second-line and then receive secukinumab third line, where there is a preference to treat within the same class initially. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) treatments such as adalimumab, etanercept, and secukinumab have a time-limited benefit with treatments tending to be associated with a loss of clinical benefit at a predictable rate. The Committee considered that, as a consequence, patients transition to another treatment option either within the same class or with a different mechanism of action, although noting that response rates diminish with each subsequent bDMARD. The Committee considered that there is a greater unmet health need for another third-line treatment than there is for another second-line treatment in PsA, considering the available funded options and benefits that may be gained from them in the second-line versus third-line setting.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is high persistence in New Zealand on TNFi and that some patients may remain on treatment, despite not experiencing the 50% reduction in swollen joints required to meet the renewal criteria for bDMARDs, if they have no other funded treatment options. Members considered that some patients and their clinicians prefer not to change the treatment but rather accept small benefits with the same ongoing treatment, and that it is common for patients and clinicians to try to obtain as much benefit as they can from a particular treatment before opting to switch. The Committee considered that Pharmac should also seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether patients with PsA who receive smaller benefits from treatment (eg a 20% improvement) would remain on their treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective Janus Kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor (JAKi) and is a targeted synthetic treatment. The Committee considered that, based on the available evidence, the fact that upadacitinib is a targeted synthetic is unlikely to make a difference to likely response rates compared with currently funded bDMARDs for PsA. Members considered that there does not appear to be an overall JAKi class effect yet identified but considered that subclasses of JAKi exist and that these types have similar effects and subtle differences depending on the indication. The Committee noted that upadacitinib is <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/r/rinvoqtab.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Medsafe-approved</a> for the treatment of active PsA, in adult patients for whom one or more DMARDs have not provided an adequate response or are not tolerated (used as monotherapy or in combination with a non-biological DMARD). The Committee noted that the proposed dosing for upadacitinib in PsA is 15mg daily, not 30mg, as the higher dose was not pursued by the supplier due to toxicity.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the application proposed upadacitinib be funded as a second or subsequent treatment in the paradigm for PsA following the use of bDMARDS (adalimumab or etanercept) and that the comparator proposed was secukinumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib has been recommended for funding in Australia (<a href=""https://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2021-03/files/upadacitinib-PsA-psd-mar-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PBAC, 2021</a>) and in Canada (<a href=""https://cadth.ca/sites/default/files/DRR/2021/SR0658%20Rinvoq%20-%20Final%20CADTH%20Rec.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CADTH, 2021</a>) for patients with PsA who, in effect, have not experienced an adequate response to conventional DMARDs, the Canadian recommendation being subject to cost neutrality with biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs; and has been recommended for funding in England and Wales (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta768/resources/upadacitinib-for-treating-active-psoriatic-arthritis-after-inadequate-response-to-dmards-pdf-82611442622149"" target=""_blank"">NICE, 2022</a>) for patients with PsA who have had two conventional DMARDs and at least one biological DMARD, or for whom TNFi are contraindicated.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2020;80:312-20</a>). The Committee noted that participants received once daily treatment with either upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, placebo followed by upadacitinib 15 mg at week 24, or placebo followed by upadacitinib 30 mg at week 24. The Committee noted the characteristics of trial participants and considered that the relevant New Zealand patient population would be similar. The Committee noted that about one third of the trial population had received two prior bDMARDs and therefore the trial represented evidence of both second-line and third-line use, although the trial outcomes were not reported stratified according to the number of prior lines.</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of SELECT PsA 2, the proportion of patients with improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 12, was 56.9% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 63.8% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 24.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.001 for both upadacitinib arms vs placebo). The Committee noted that ACR50 at week 12 was 31.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 37.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 4.7% with placebo, and AR70 at week 12 was 8.5% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 16.5% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo (P≤0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). The Committee considered that there was evidence of a benefit of upadacitinib compared with placebo and that the two upadacitinib doses had similar efficacy to each other. Members considered that the proportions receiving ACR20/50/70 responses represented a typical spread of these outcomes of therapy in this disease. The Committee considered that the ACR20/50/70 are reported to correlate with health-related quality of life and productivity measures, and members considered that patients may experience a greater benefit than is indicated by the ACR20 result alone.</p><p>1.11.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI75) at week 24 in SELECT PsA 2 was 53.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 62.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 19.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo).

The Committee noted that the higher dose (30mg) was not pursued by the supplier for PsA due to its association with an increased incidence of AEs. Members noted that AEs in SELECT PsA 2 were reported according to a log scale, used Poisson regression, and that the point estimates were not centrally positioned.

The Committee considered that upadacitinib appears to benefit all patients with PsA and considered that it could also produce a benefit for family/whānau of people with PsA. The Committee noted that there was no direct comparative evidence of upadacitinib or secukinumab compared to a second anti-TNF after inadequate response from a first-line bDMARD, but considered that it was plausible there could be a benefit from a treatment with a different mechanism of action.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that good disease control was the main factor determining health system resource use regardless of the treatment type for PsA, and that patients with more controlled disease would likely have less requirement for outpatient visits (eg specialist consultation every two years). Members considered that better disease control may be associated with a reduction in joint surgery. Members also considered that the evidence linking biologic treatment to reduced surgery requirements is weak, and may be due to patients needing to present with severe disease and erosions at baseline to qualify for biologic treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that oral upadacitinib would have a suitability benefit over subcutaneous secukinumab, which is generally self-administered by patients or is administered at home or in the community by health workers in a small number of cases. The Committee therefore considered there would be no substantial impact to healthcare workers if upadacitinib were funded for PsA. The Committee considered that the suitability of upadacitinib as an oral treatment would be of benefit especially to Māori and people who live in rural areas, who may find it more suitable and accessible than alternative treatments that are injected subcutaneously.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was unlikely to be a prevalent cohort of patients who would switch to upadacitinib second-line or third-line upon listing, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether there is a prevalent group of patients who would switch to upadacitinib upon listing and what size that group might be.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that upadacitinib would most likely be used as a third-line treatment following secukinumab, especially for patients with pre-existing elevated CV risk who would benefit from other treatments first. However, the Committee considered that second-line use of upadacitinib would be expected if funding permitted this and considered that upadacitinib could gradually replace a portion of the current secukinumab second-line market (members noted the ACR and EULAR guidelines’ authors considered upadacitinib may take part of the second-line market). The Committee considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on the benefits and risks of second-line vs third-line use of upadacitinib for PsA, where upadacitinib would be used in the treatment paradigm, the current treatment sequencing for PsA, and whether upadacitinib would be used second-line for patients who received secukinumab first-line.

The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for PsA as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments.

The Committee noted that PsA is one of several closely related inflammatory conditions that are collectively grouped under the term spondyloarthritis; this group also includes ankylosing spondylitis, acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

The Committee noted that there is no agreed New Zealand-specific treatment paradigm for PsA, and was made aware of recent international guidelines from 2018 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30499246/"" target=""_blank"">Singh et al. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2019;71:5-32</a>) and 2020 (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/59/Supplement_1/i37/5802853"" target=""_blank"">Ogdie et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59(Suppl_1):i37-i46</a>) which include treatment guidelines and recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). The Committee was made aware that the sequence of treatments for PsA in these guidelines commences with physical therapies followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatories according to a ‘treat to target’ principle, and that following this treatment may be escalated to the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or to a biologic DMARD (bDMARD). The Committee noted that funded bDMARD options include tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, ie adalimumab or etanercept) or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL17i) such as secukinumab, and that these may also be used in combination with a conventional DMARD. The Committee was made aware that subsequent options available internationally with different mechanisms of action to TNFi and IL17i may include upadacitinib, tofacitinib, abatacept or guselkumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adalimumab would be the most common first-line bDMARD in New Zealand due to its benefits for skin and joint disease and considered that the disease-related threshold to access funded bDMARDs in New Zealand is high and would include patients with severe and erosive disease (the Special Authority criteria for adalimumab currently requiring 15 swollen or four major joints with persistent symptoms of poorly controlled active disease to be eligible). The Committee noted that secukinumab was funded in 2021 for PsA and that Pharmac’s Special Authority data reports 20-25% of secukinumab patients with PsA had not had a prior biologic. The Committee considered this could be due to patients who received adalimumab in the past having a long delay before starting secukinumab. The Committee also considered that first-line use of secukinumab would be unlikely to increase over time given the preference for a first-line anti-TNF and the residual uncertainty about the optimal treatment sequencing in PsA. The Committee considered that the use of secukinumab first-line would be unlikely to increase, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s views on secukinumab first-line use. The Committee considered that some patients would receive treatment with a TNFi then proceed to secukinumab second-line and then receive another TNFi in the third line, although some might receive a different TNFi in the second-line and then receive secukinumab third line, where there is a preference to treat within the same class initially. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) treatments such as adalimumab, etanercept, and secukinumab have a time-limited benefit with treatments tending to be associated with a loss of clinical benefit at a predictable rate. The Committee considered that, as a consequence, patients transition to another treatment option either within the same class or with a different mechanism of action, although noting that response rates diminish with each subsequent bDMARD. The Committee considered that there is a greater unmet health need for another third-line treatment than there is for another second-line treatment in PsA, considering the available funded options and benefits that may be gained from them in the second-line versus third-line setting.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is high persistence in New Zealand on TNFi and that some patients may remain on treatment, despite not experiencing the 50% reduction in swollen joints required to meet the renewal criteria for bDMARDs, if they have no other funded treatment options. Members considered that some patients and their clinicians prefer not to change the treatment but rather accept small benefits with the same ongoing treatment, and that it is common for patients and clinicians to try to obtain as much benefit as they can from a particular treatment before opting to switch. The Committee considered that Pharmac should also seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether patients with PsA who receive smaller benefits from treatment (eg a 20% improvement) would remain on their treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective Janus Kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor (JAKi) and is a targeted synthetic treatment. The Committee considered that, based on the available evidence, the fact that upadacitinib is a targeted synthetic is unlikely to make a difference to likely response rates compared with currently funded bDMARDs for PsA. Members considered that there does not appear to be an overall JAKi class effect yet identified but considered that subclasses of JAKi exist and that these types have similar effects and subtle differences depending on the indication.

The Committee noted that about one third of the trial population had received two prior bDMARDs and therefore the trial represented evidence of both second-line and third-line use, although the trial outcomes were not reported stratified according to the number of prior lines.</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of SELECT PsA 2, the proportion of patients with improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 12, was 56.9% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 63.8% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 24.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.001 for both upadacitinib arms vs placebo). The Committee noted that ACR50 at week 12 was 31.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 37.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 4.7% with placebo, and AR70 at week 12 was 8.5% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 16.5% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo (P≤0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). The Committee considered that there was evidence of a benefit of upadacitinib compared with placebo and that the two upadacitinib doses had similar efficacy to each other. Members considered that the proportions receiving ACR20/50/70 responses represented a typical spread of these outcomes of therapy in this disease. The Committee considered that the ACR20/50/70 are reported to correlate with health-related quality of life and productivity measures, and members considered that patients may experience a greater benefit than is indicated by the ACR20 result alone.</p><p>1.11.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI75) at week 24 in SELECT PsA 2 was 53.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 62.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 19.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). Members considered that the PASI75/90/100 scores were spread in a similar manner to the ACR20/50/70 responses.</p><p>1.11.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the proportion of patients achieving minimal disease activity (MDA) at week 24 in SELECT PsA 2 was 25.1% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 28.9% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 2.8% with placebo (P&lt;0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). The Committee noted that MDA is reported to correlate with outcomes including radiologic progression, quality of life and productivity measures. Members considered that MDA may be a more rigorous, useful and desirable measure than ACR20 from a patient perspective, and considered that MDA represents a state of almost full health.</p><p>1.11.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the change from baseline in Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score at week 24 in SELECT PsA 2 was -33.4 with upadacitinib 15 mg, -36.6 with upadacitinib 30 mg and -14.3 with placebo (P≤0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). The Committee noted that the DAPSA is a composite score that uses clinical and non-clinical measures.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that at 56 weeks in SELECT PsA 2 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33913086/"" target=""_blank"">Mease et al. Rheumatol Ther. 2021;8:903-19</a>), after the placebo groups had crossed over to upadacitinib 15mg or 30mg, the proportion of patients achieving ACR20/50/70 was 59.7%/40.8%/24.2% with upadacitinib 15mg and 59.2%/38.5%/26.6% with upadacitinib 30mg. The Committee noted that about half of the patients were still receiving upadacitinib at 56 weeks and considered that the effect of upadacitinib vs placebo seen at 24 weeks was sustained to 56 weeks.</p><p>1.12.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that at 56 weeks the main difference in adverse events (AEs) in SELECT PsA 2 from what was reported at 24 weeks was the risk of infection in both the upadacitinib 15mg and 30mg groups, although considered that an increased risk of infection is not uncommon with treatments for PsA. The Committee noted that the higher dose (30mg) was not pursued by the supplier for PsA due to its association with an increased incidence of AEs. Members noted that AEs in SELECT PsA 2 were reported according to a log scale, used Poisson regression, and that the point estimates were not centrally positioned. Members considered that infections with herpes simplex would be manageable, however, that a recombinant vaccine for herpes zoster would be desirable given that live vaccines are contraindicated for patients receiving upadacitinib.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, has an FDA black box warning regarding the risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, cancer, blood clots or death. The Committee considered that the 56-week safety data for upadacitinib in PsA was insufficient to fully determine its potential medium-term risks. However, the Committee noted that there is growing evidence for the use of JAK inhibitors, which share some subclass effects, for other diseases and noted that preclinical evidence suggests upadacitinib’s selective inhibition of JAK1 may impact on its safety profile compared with tofacitinib, which inhibits JAK2/3.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is no evidence to indicate whether or not upadacitinib would convey a benefit in cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction for PsA, noting that evidence suggests treatment with methotrexate either alone or in combination with a TNF-inhibitor in psoriasis is thought to convey a CV benefit for patients with existing CV risk (eg in patients with psoriasis who have inflammatory arthritis). Members also considered that, given the elevated CV risk in patients with severe and untreated arthritis, that reducing inflammation with any treatment might reduce CV risk.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) from the SELECT-PsA 2 trial, almost all of which were nominally and significantly improved from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 with either upadacitinib dose (P&lt;0.05 for each dose vs placebo) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/34661885/"" target=""_blank"">Strand et al.

The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of SELECT-PsA 1 was ACR20 and was made aware of published 24-week data reporting non-inferiority of upadacitinib 15mg to adalimumab every other week and a similar higher incidence of infections with upadacitinib 15mg vs placebo or adalimumab (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2022516?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">McInnes et al.

The Committee considered this evidence suggested that the ACR20 response with upadacitinib for PsA in the first-line was slightly better than the response in a second or subsequent line. The Committee considered this pattern was also seen in other diseases where there is third-line use of upadacitinib due to its mechanism of action, and considered that this decreasing benefit with each subsequent line was different to that seen with other bDMARDs for PsA.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the published results of the EXCEED trial, which reported secukinumab 300mg was non-inferior to adalimumab 40mg as first-line therapy in PsA (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(20)30564-X"" target=""_blank"">McInnes et al.

The Committee considered that upadacitinib appears to benefit all patients with PsA and considered that it could also produce a benefit for family/whānau of people with PsA. The Committee noted that there was no direct comparative evidence of upadacitinib or secukinumab compared to a second anti-TNF after inadequate response from a first-line bDMARD, but considered that it was plausible there could be a benefit from a treatment with a different mechanism of action.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that good disease control was the main factor determining health system resource use regardless of the treatment type for PsA, and that patients with more controlled disease would likely have less requirement for outpatient visits (eg specialist consultation every two years). Members considered that better disease control may be associated with a reduction in joint surgery. Members also considered that the evidence linking biologic treatment to reduced surgery requirements is weak, and may be due to patients needing to present with severe disease and erosions at baseline to qualify for biologic treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that oral upadacitinib would have a suitability benefit over subcutaneous secukinumab, which is generally self-administered by patients or is administered at home or in the community by health workers in a small number of cases. The Committee therefore considered there would be no substantial impact to healthcare workers if upadacitinib were funded for PsA. The Committee considered that the suitability of upadacitinib as an oral treatment would be of benefit especially to Māori and people who live in rural areas, who may find it more suitable and accessible than alternative treatments that are injected subcutaneously.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was unlikely to be a prevalent cohort of patients who would switch to upadacitinib second-line or third-line upon listing, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether there is a prevalent group of patients who would switch to upadacitinib upon listing and what size that group might be.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that upadacitinib would most likely be used as a third-line treatment following secukinumab, especially for patients with pre-existing elevated CV risk who would benefit from other treatments first. However, the Committee considered that second-line use of upadacitinib would be expected if funding permitted this and considered that upadacitinib could gradually replace a portion of the current secukinumab second-line market (members noted the ACR and EULAR guidelines’ authors considered upadacitinib may take part of the second-line market). The Committee considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on the benefits and risks of second-line vs third-line use of upadacitinib for PsA, where upadacitinib would be used in the treatment paradigm, the current treatment sequencing for PsA, and whether upadacitinib would be used second-line for patients who received secukinumab first-line. The Committee considered that upadacitinib would not be used in combination with other treatments for PsA, as the risk of infection would be unacceptably high.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that secukinumab would be the appropriate comparator for upadacitinib second-line treatment, however, that it was unclear what was the appropriate comparator for upadacitinib in the third line, and considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view, especially given potential variation in practice. The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for PsA as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments. The Committee therefore considered that true cost-neutrality to the pharmaceutical budget may be difficult to achieve.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s views of what elements should comprise Special Authority criteria for second-line and third-line use of upadacitinib for PsA.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for upadacitinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for second-line treatment of PsA.

The Committee noted that major manifestations of PsA include inflammatory arthropathy and enthesitis usually associated with skin manifestations. The Committee noted that PsA is one of several closely related inflammatory conditions that are collectively grouped under the term spondyloarthritis; this group also includes ankylosing spondylitis, acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

The Committee noted that there is no agreed New Zealand-specific treatment paradigm for PsA, and was made aware of recent international guidelines from 2018 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30499246/"" target=""_blank"">Singh et al. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2019;71:5-32</a>) and 2020 (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/59/Supplement_1/i37/5802853"" target=""_blank"">Ogdie et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59(Suppl_1):i37-i46</a>) which include treatment guidelines and recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). The Committee was made aware that the sequence of treatments for PsA in these guidelines commences with physical therapies followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatories according to a ‘treat to target’ principle, and that following this treatment may be escalated to the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or to a biologic DMARD (bDMARD). The Committee noted that funded bDMARD options include tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, ie adalimumab or etanercept) or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL17i) such as secukinumab, and that these may also be used in combination with a conventional DMARD. The Committee was made aware that subsequent options available internationally with different mechanisms of action to TNFi and IL17i may include upadacitinib, tofacitinib, abatacept or guselkumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adalimumab would be the most common first-line bDMARD in New Zealand due to its benefits for skin and joint disease and considered that the disease-related threshold to access funded bDMARDs in New Zealand is high and would include patients with severe and erosive disease (the Special Authority criteria for adalimumab currently requiring 15 swollen or four major joints with persistent symptoms of poorly controlled active disease to be eligible). The Committee noted that secukinumab was funded in 2021 for PsA and that Pharmac’s Special Authority data reports 20-25% of secukinumab patients with PsA had not had a prior biologic. The Committee considered this could be due to patients who received adalimumab in the past having a long delay before starting secukinumab. The Committee also considered that first-line use of secukinumab would be unlikely to increase over time given the preference for a first-line anti-TNF and the residual uncertainty about the optimal treatment sequencing in PsA. The Committee considered that the use of secukinumab first-line would be unlikely to increase, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s views on secukinumab first-line use. The Committee considered that some patients would receive treatment with a TNFi then proceed to secukinumab second-line and then receive another TNFi in the third line, although some might receive a different TNFi in the second-line and then receive secukinumab third line, where there is a preference to treat within the same class initially. The Committee considered there was uncertainty in the current treatment paradigm and that Pharmac should seek advice from Rheumatology Advisory Committee regarding this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funded biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) treatments such as adalimumab, etanercept, and secukinumab have a time-limited benefit with treatments tending to be associated with a loss of clinical benefit at a predictable rate. The Committee considered that, as a consequence, patients transition to another treatment option either within the same class or with a different mechanism of action, although noting that response rates diminish with each subsequent bDMARD. The Committee considered that there is a greater unmet health need for another third-line treatment than there is for another second-line treatment in PsA, considering the available funded options and benefits that may be gained from them in the second-line versus third-line setting.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is high persistence in New Zealand on TNFi and that some patients may remain on treatment, despite not experiencing the 50% reduction in swollen joints required to meet the renewal criteria for bDMARDs, if they have no other funded treatment options. Members considered that some patients and their clinicians prefer not to change the treatment but rather accept small benefits with the same ongoing treatment, and that it is common for patients and clinicians to try to obtain as much benefit as they can from a particular treatment before opting to switch. The Committee considered that Pharmac should also seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether patients with PsA who receive smaller benefits from treatment (eg a 20% improvement) would remain on their treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is an oral, selective Janus Kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor (JAKi) and is a targeted synthetic treatment. The Committee considered that, based on the available evidence, the fact that upadacitinib is a targeted synthetic is unlikely to make a difference to likely response rates compared with currently funded bDMARDs for PsA. Members considered that there does not appear to be an overall JAKi class effect yet identified but considered that subclasses of JAKi exist and that these types have similar effects and subtle differences depending on the indication. The Committee noted that upadacitinib is <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/r/rinvoqtab.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Medsafe-approved</a> for the treatment of active PsA, in adult patients for whom one or more DMARDs have not provided an adequate response or are not tolerated (used as monotherapy or in combination with a non-biological DMARD). The Committee noted that the proposed dosing for upadacitinib in PsA is 15mg daily, not 30mg, as the higher dose was not pursued by the supplier due to toxicity.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the application proposed upadacitinib be funded as a second or subsequent treatment in the paradigm for PsA following the use of bDMARDS (adalimumab or etanercept) and that the comparator proposed was secukinumab.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib has been recommended for funding in Australia (<a href=""https://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2021-03/files/upadacitinib-PsA-psd-mar-2021.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PBAC, 2021</a>) and in Canada (<a href=""https://cadth.ca/sites/default/files/DRR/2021/SR0658%20Rinvoq%20-%20Final%20CADTH%20Rec.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CADTH, 2021</a>) for patients with PsA who, in effect, have not experienced an adequate response to conventional DMARDs, the Canadian recommendation being subject to cost neutrality with biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs; and has been recommended for funding in England and Wales (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta768/resources/upadacitinib-for-treating-active-psoriatic-arthritis-after-inadequate-response-to-dmards-pdf-82611442622149"" target=""_blank"">NICE, 2022</a>) for patients with PsA who have had two conventional DMARDs and at least one biological DMARD, or for whom TNFi are contraindicated.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2020;80:312-20</a>). The Committee noted that participants received once daily treatment with either upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, placebo followed by upadacitinib 15 mg at week 24, or placebo followed by upadacitinib 30 mg at week 24. The Committee noted the characteristics of trial participants and considered that the relevant New Zealand patient population would be similar. The Committee noted that about one third of the trial population had received two prior bDMARDs and therefore the trial represented evidence of both second-line and third-line use, although the trial outcomes were not reported stratified according to the number of prior lines.</p><p>1.11.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of SELECT PsA 2, the proportion of patients with improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 12, was 56.9% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 63.8% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 24.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.001 for both upadacitinib arms vs placebo). The Committee noted that ACR50 at week 12 was 31.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 37.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 4.7% with placebo, and AR70 at week 12 was 8.5% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 16.5% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo (P≤0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo). The Committee considered that there was evidence of a benefit of upadacitinib compared with placebo and that the two upadacitinib doses had similar efficacy to each other. Members considered that the proportions receiving ACR20/50/70 responses represented a typical spread of these outcomes of therapy in this disease. The Committee considered that the ACR20/50/70 are reported to correlate with health-related quality of life and productivity measures, and members considered that patients may experience a greater benefit than is indicated by the ACR20 result alone.</p><p>1.11.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>The Committee noted that the proportions of patients achieving a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI75) at week 24 in SELECT PsA 2 was 53.8% with upadacitinib 15 mg, 62.6% with upadacitinib 30 mg and 19.1% with placebo (P&lt;0.05 for each upadacitinib dose vs placebo).

The Committee noted that the higher dose (30mg) was not pursued by the supplier for PsA due to its association with an increased incidence of AEs. Members noted that AEs in SELECT PsA 2 were reported according to a log scale, used Poisson regression, and that the point estimates were not centrally positioned.

The Committee considered that the 56-week safety data for upadacitinib in PsA was insufficient to fully determine its potential medium-term risks. However, the Committee noted that there is growing evidence for the use of JAK inhibitors, which share some subclass effects, for other diseases and noted that preclinical evidence suggests upadacitinib’s selective inhibition of JAK1 may impact on its safety profile compared with tofacitinib, which inhibits JAK2/3.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is no evidence to indicate whether or not upadacitinib would convey a benefit in cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction for PsA, noting that evidence suggests treatment with methotrexate either alone or in combination with a TNF-inhibitor in psoriasis is thought to convey a CV benefit for patients with existing CV risk (eg in patients with psoriasis who have inflammatory arthritis).

The Committee considered that upadacitinib appears to benefit all patients with PsA and considered that it could also produce a benefit for family/whānau of people with PsA. The Committee noted that there was no direct comparative evidence of upadacitinib or secukinumab compared to a second anti-TNF after inadequate response from a first-line bDMARD, but considered that it was plausible there could be a benefit from a treatment with a different mechanism of action.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that good disease control was the main factor determining health system resource use regardless of the treatment type for PsA, and that patients with more controlled disease would likely have less requirement for outpatient visits (eg specialist consultation every two years). Members considered that better disease control may be associated with a reduction in joint surgery. Members also considered that the evidence linking biologic treatment to reduced surgery requirements is weak, and may be due to patients needing to present with severe disease and erosions at baseline to qualify for biologic treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that oral upadacitinib would have a suitability benefit over subcutaneous secukinumab, which is generally self-administered by patients or is administered at home or in the community by health workers in a small number of cases. The Committee therefore considered there would be no substantial impact to healthcare workers if upadacitinib were funded for PsA. The Committee considered that the suitability of upadacitinib as an oral treatment would be of benefit especially to Māori and people who live in rural areas, who may find it more suitable and accessible than alternative treatments that are injected subcutaneously.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was unlikely to be a prevalent cohort of patients who would switch to upadacitinib second-line or third-line upon listing, although considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on whether there is a prevalent group of patients who would switch to upadacitinib upon listing and what size that group might be.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that upadacitinib would most likely be used as a third-line treatment following secukinumab, especially for patients with pre-existing elevated CV risk who would benefit from other treatments first. However, the Committee considered that second-line use of upadacitinib would be expected if funding permitted this and considered that upadacitinib could gradually replace a portion of the current secukinumab second-line market (members noted the ACR and EULAR guidelines’ authors considered upadacitinib may take part of the second-line market). The Committee considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view on the benefits and risks of second-line vs third-line use of upadacitinib for PsA, where upadacitinib would be used in the treatment paradigm, the current treatment sequencing for PsA, and whether upadacitinib would be used second-line for patients who received secukinumab first-line. The Committee considered that upadacitinib would not be used in combination with other treatments for PsA, as the risk of infection would be unacceptably high.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that secukinumab would be the appropriate comparator for upadacitinib second-line treatment, however, that it was unclear what was the appropriate comparator for upadacitinib in the third line, and considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s view, especially given potential variation in practice. The Committee considered that if upadacitinib was listed at the same line of treatment as secukinumab, this would still result in an extension in the length of time patients spend on treatment for PsA as patients would have access to a greater number of treatments. The Committee therefore considered that true cost-neutrality to the pharmaceutical budget may be difficult to achieve.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that Pharmac should seek the Rheumatology Advisory Committee’s views of what elements should comprise Special Authority criteria for second-line and third-line use of upadacitinib for PsA.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for upadacitinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for second-line treatment of PsA.

The Committee considered that as more bDMARDs become available, it becomes less likely that individuals with PsA will stay on a bDMARD in the absence of receiving any significant treatment benefit.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that individuals included in clinical trials presented with severe and mostly homogenous clinical manifestations of PsA, particularly peripheral polyarthritis.</p><p><br></p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, assuming there is broad equivalence of efficacy across bDMARDS, their sequencing should be driven by financial impact. The Committee considered that based on the evidence available, upadacitinib appeared to be associated with broadly similar efficacy compared to other bDMARDS used in this indication, specifically secukinumab, adalimumab, and etanercept.</p><p><br></p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the goal of treatment is typically to attain low disease activity. The Committee considered that persistence on treatment is often determined by personal preferences, and that people may stay on treatment despite receiving smaller benefits from treatment if they feel they are still experiencing improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most people would receive first-line treatment with an anti-TNF. The Committee noted Pharmac staff’s estimate that approximately 20% of people receive secukinumab as a first-line biologic and considered that this was plausible. The Committee considered that secukinumab would be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for those people who had severe skin involvement, given secukinumab is associated with better effectiveness in psoriasis. The Committee considered that upadacitinib is also relatively effective for treating skin involvement and so it may be used similarly to secukinumab in those with severe skin involvement.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that anti-TNFs are less effective in PsA compared to ankylosing spondylitis and considered that secukinumab is used as a second-line biologic more often in PsA than in ankylosing spondylitis, where anti-TNFs are generally more effective than in PsA. The Committee considered that switching to a second anti-TNF after failure of a first anti-TNF is still relatively common in PsA. The Committee considered that secukinumab is often used after trialling two prior anti-TNFs (ie as a third-line option).</p><p><br></p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results of SELECT-PsA; a phase III, randomised, double-blind 1 trial in 1705 patients with active PsA who had a history of inadequate response to at least one conventional synthetic DMARD. The Committee noted that patients were randomised to receive\xa0upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg once daily, placebo followed by\xa0upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg once daily starting at week 24, or adalimumab 40 mg every other week. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of SELECT-PsA 1 was American College off Rheumatology 20 score (ACR20) and was made aware of published 24-week data reporting non-inferiority of upadacitinib 15 mg to adalimumab every other week and a similar higher incidence of infections with upadacitinib 15 mg vs placebo or adalimumab (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2022516?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">McInnes et al.

The Committee noted that low or minimal disease activity was achieved in 25-48% of patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg versus 2-16% of patients receiving placebo, and remission or very low disease activity rates were 7-14% with upadacitinib 15 mg versus 0-4% with placebo.</p><p><br></p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following evidence reviewed by PTAC in May 2022:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol; color: windowtext;"">·</span><span style=""color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33272960/"" target=""_blank"">Mease et al.
