The Subcommittee noted that high risk was defined as two or more of the following: Gleason Score \u2265 8, 3 or more lesions on bone scan, and/or visceral metastases (excluding nodes). The Subcommittee noted the design of the LATITUDE trial and the results of the interim analysis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578607\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:352-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the trial was unblinded, to allow crossover, as a result of the findings of the interim analysis. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial, which was not available at the time PTAC reviewed the application in November 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:686-700</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 51.8 months, the median overall survival was 53.3 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 36.5 months in the placebo group (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that 275 deaths (46%) had occurred in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 343 (57%) in the placebo group. The Subcommittee noted that compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone improved time to skeletal related events (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; <i>P</i>=0.0181), time to chemotherapy initiation (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), time to subsequent prostate cancer therapy (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.53; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), and time to prostate-specific antigen progression (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.36; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis, 72 patients had crossed over from placebo to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted safety data from the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 21% [n\u00a0=\u00a0125], placebo 10% [n = 60], crossover 4% [n = 3]) and hypokalaemia (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 12% [n\u00a0=\u00a070], placebo 2% [n = 10], crossover 3% [n = 2]). The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a030) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 13) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 4% (n\u00a0=\u00a024) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 11) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee considered that no new safety signals were identified.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the patient-reported outcome and health-related quality of life analysis of the LATITUDE trial after a median follow-up of 30.9 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326030\" target=\"_blank\">Chi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:194-206</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the analysis included the Brief Pain Inventory\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Short Form, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate scale (FACT-P), and the EuroQoL questionnaire. The Subcommittee noted that adherence was 90% or higher for all patient reported outcome measurement tools. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to deterioration of functional status according to FACT-P was 12.9 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 8.3 months in the placebo group (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; <i>P</i>=0.032). The Subcommittee noted that the median time to pain interference progression was not reached in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group compared with 18.4 months in the placebo group (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.80; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional evidence for the use of abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT is provided by Arm G of the open-label, multi-arm, multi-stage, Phase 2-3 STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578639\" target=\"_blank\">James et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:338-51</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ARM G contained four groups of patients: 50% of patients were those with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 20% were men with newly diagnosed node positive but not otherwise metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 27% were those with newly diagnosed but node negative high risk locally advanced prostate cancer (high risk defined as T3,4 disease; Gleason 8 \u2013 10, PSA \u2265 40 nG/mL); and a final group of men previously treated with radical surgery or brachytherapy no longer receiving therapy and newly relapsing with high risk features and that this was the smallest group (&lt;5% in both arms).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that for the whole study population the 3-year survival was 83% in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm (Arm G), compared with 76% in the ADT-alone arm (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.76; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that failure free survival time in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm was 43.9 months, compared with 30.0 months in the ADT-alone arm, that the 3-year progression-free survival was 80% compared with 62% (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and that the 3-year rate without symptomatic skeletal events was 88% compared with 78% (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that among the 1476 patients in the safety population in the relevant sub-analysis of STAMPEDE in whom progression had not occurred within the first year, the prevalence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 15% among patients who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT, compared with 11% in the ADT alone group. The Subcommittee noted that the main adverse events that occurred over and above the control therapy were hypertension, mild increases in aminotransferase levels, and respiratory disorders.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the patient population in STAMPEDE differed from the patients in LATITUDE; STAMPEDE included patients with non-metastatic disease and patients with high-risk disease defined by different criteria. The Subcommittee considered that this limits the value of direct comparison between the trials. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no head-to-head trial comparing abiraterone plus ADT with docetaxel plus ADT, but did identify three network meta\u2011analyses that indirectly compared the agents (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218976\" target=\"_blank\">Feyerabend et al. Eur J Cancer. 2018;103:78-87</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037513\" target=\"_blank\">Wallis et al. Eur Urol. 2018;73:834-44</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788164\" target=\"_blank\">Vale et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1249-57</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Feyerabend et al (2018) reported that abiraterone plus prednisone and ADT is at least as effective in reducing the risk of death as docetaxel plus ADT; and was reportedly better at preventing disease progression and improving quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that Wallis et al (2018) reported that there was no significant difference in overall survival between abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT and docetaxel plus ADT. The Subcommittee noted that Vale et al (2018) reported that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone appears to be the most effective treatment, although considered it was not clear whether this is due to an increased benefit or variation in the trials included. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a direct, randomised comparison of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT with docetaxel plus ADT was conducted as part of the STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961425/\" target=\"_blank\">Sydes et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1235-1248</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was not a formally powered comparison. The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 4 years, there were 44/189 (23%) deaths in the docetaxel arm and 105/377 (28%) deaths in the abiraterone acetate arm (all patients: overall survival HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.65; patients with metastatic disease: overall survival HR=1.13; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that guidelines from NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT are appropriate for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive disease who are fit enough to receive these agents.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that metastatic prostate cancer in New Zealand is primarily diagnosed by a positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI, and that these were the criteria used for eligibility in the LATITUDE trial. The Subcommittee noted that gallium-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (PSMA) PET imaging is a diagnostic tool available privately in New Zealand that has better specificity and sensitivity than standard imaging modalities for detecting metastatic prostate cancer. The Subcommittee considered that there is pressure to more widely introduce PSMA PET technology, and that this has potential consequences for equity due to variable access as patients who are able to access PSMA-PET could qualify for treatment earlier in their disease course. The Subcommittee also considered that it is unclear at this time whether metastatic disease diagnosed using PSMA PET imaging is comparable with metastatic disease diagnosed using conventional imaging modalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted PTAC\u2019s recommendation that abiraterone acetate, for use in combination with prednisone and ADT in a wider group of patients than those meeting the eligibility criteria for the LATITUDE trial, be deferred until additional data in these settings is available. The Subcommittee considered that the data from the STAMPEDE trial suggests that there is potential for abiraterone acetate to have health benefits in a population wider than that described by LATITUDE, but agreed that this evidence is not yet mature enough to make a positive recommendation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the existing Special Authority criteria for abiraterone acetate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer stipulates that where patients are previously treated with chemotherapy containing a taxane they must have had prior treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone were funded for newly diagnosed castrate sensitive or hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer, that this criterion should not be changed. However, the Subcommittee considered that amendment should be made to preclude prior abiraterone treatment for patients who have not received prior taxane chemotherapy. The Subcommittee considered that patients should be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate only once, either for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC or for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, as there is a lack of evidence to support a further line of abiraterone treatment following relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC that there would likely be a decrease in the use of docetaxel and bicalutamide. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC subject to the eligibility criteria in LATITUDE, that the patient number estimates provided by the supplier were reasonable (n = 113 in year 1, increasing to n\u00a0=\u00a0520 in year 5). The Subcommittee considered that uptake of abiraterone acetate in these populations would be high as there would likely be a preference for abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT over ADT and docetaxel. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate, in combination with prednisone and ADT, for the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC provided by LATITUDE, was of moderate to high quality, and that there is a need for an alternative treatment option for these patients. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC, that the Special Authority criteria should reflect the eligibility criteria of the LATITUDE trial.</p>",

N Engl J Med. 2017;377:352-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the trial was unblinded, to allow crossover, as a result of the findings of the interim analysis. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial, which was not available at the time PTAC reviewed the application in November 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:686-700</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 51.8 months, the median overall survival was 53.3 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 36.5 months in the placebo group (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that 275 deaths (46%) had occurred in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 343 (57%) in the placebo group. The Subcommittee noted that compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone improved time to skeletal related events (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; <i>P</i>=0.0181), time to chemotherapy initiation (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), time to subsequent prostate cancer therapy (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.53; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), and time to prostate-specific antigen progression (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.36; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis, 72 patients had crossed over from placebo to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted safety data from the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 21% [n\u00a0=\u00a0125], placebo 10% [n = 60], crossover 4% [n = 3]) and hypokalaemia (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 12% [n\u00a0=\u00a070], placebo 2% [n = 10], crossover 3% [n = 2]). The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a030) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 13) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 4% (n\u00a0=\u00a024) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 11) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee considered that no new safety signals were identified.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the patient-reported outcome and health-related quality of life analysis of the LATITUDE trial after a median follow-up of 30.9 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326030\" target=\"_blank\">Chi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:194-206</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the analysis included the Brief Pain Inventory\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Short Form, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate scale (FACT-P), and the EuroQoL questionnaire. The Subcommittee noted that adherence was 90% or higher for all patient reported outcome measurement tools. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to deterioration of functional status according to FACT-P was 12.9 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 8.3 months in the placebo group (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; <i>P</i>=0.032). The Subcommittee noted that the median time to pain interference progression was not reached in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group compared with 18.4 months in the placebo group (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.80; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional evidence for the use of abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT is provided by Arm G of the open-label, multi-arm, multi-stage, Phase 2-3 STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578639\" target=\"_blank\">James et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:338-51</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ARM G contained four groups of patients: 50% of patients were those with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 20% were men with newly diagnosed node positive but not otherwise metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 27% were those with newly diagnosed but node negative high risk locally advanced prostate cancer (high risk defined as T3,4 disease; Gleason 8 \u2013 10, PSA \u2265 40 nG/mL); and a final group of men previously treated with radical surgery or brachytherapy no longer receiving therapy and newly relapsing with high risk features and that this was the smallest group (&lt;5% in both arms).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that for the whole study population the 3-year survival was 83% in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm (Arm G), compared with 76% in the ADT-alone arm (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.76; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that failure free survival time in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm was 43.9 months, compared with 30.0 months in the ADT-alone arm, that the 3-year progression-free survival was 80% compared with 62% (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and that the 3-year rate without symptomatic skeletal events was 88% compared with 78% (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that among the 1476 patients in the safety population in the relevant sub-analysis of STAMPEDE in whom progression had not occurred within the first year, the prevalence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 15% among patients who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT, compared with 11% in the ADT alone group. The Subcommittee noted that the main adverse events that occurred over and above the control therapy were hypertension, mild increases in aminotransferase levels, and respiratory disorders.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the patient population in STAMPEDE differed from the patients in LATITUDE; STAMPEDE included patients with non-metastatic disease and patients with high-risk disease defined by different criteria. The Subcommittee considered that this limits the value of direct comparison between the trials. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no head-to-head trial comparing abiraterone plus ADT with docetaxel plus ADT, but did identify three network meta\u2011analyses that indirectly compared the agents (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218976\" target=\"_blank\">Feyerabend et al. Eur J Cancer. 2018;103:78-87</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037513\" target=\"_blank\">Wallis et al. Eur Urol. 2018;73:834-44</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788164\" target=\"_blank\">Vale et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1249-57</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Feyerabend et al (2018) reported that abiraterone plus prednisone and ADT is at least as effective in reducing the risk of death as docetaxel plus ADT; and was reportedly better at preventing disease progression and improving quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that Wallis et al (2018) reported that there was no significant difference in overall survival between abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT and docetaxel plus ADT. The Subcommittee noted that Vale et al (2018) reported that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone appears to be the most effective treatment, although considered it was not clear whether this is due to an increased benefit or variation in the trials included. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a direct, randomised comparison of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT with docetaxel plus ADT was conducted as part of the STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961425/\" target=\"_blank\">Sydes et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1235-1248</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was not a formally powered comparison. The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 4 years, there were 44/189 (23%) deaths in the docetaxel arm and 105/377 (28%) deaths in the abiraterone acetate arm (all patients: overall survival HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.65; patients with metastatic disease: overall survival HR=1.13; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that guidelines from NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT are appropriate for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive disease who are fit enough to receive these agents.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that metastatic prostate cancer in New Zealand is primarily diagnosed by a positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI, and that these were the criteria used for eligibility in the LATITUDE trial. The Subcommittee noted that gallium-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (PSMA) PET imaging is a diagnostic tool available privately in New Zealand that has better specificity and sensitivity than standard imaging modalities for detecting metastatic prostate cancer. The Subcommittee considered that there is pressure to more widely introduce PSMA PET technology, and that this has potential consequences for equity due to variable access as patients who are able to access PSMA-PET could qualify for treatment earlier in their disease course. The Subcommittee also considered that it is unclear at this time whether metastatic disease diagnosed using PSMA PET imaging is comparable with metastatic disease diagnosed using conventional imaging modalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted PTAC\u2019s recommendation that abiraterone acetate, for use in combination with prednisone and ADT in a wider group of patients than those meeting the eligibility criteria for the LATITUDE trial, be deferred until additional data in these settings is available. The Subcommittee considered that the data from the STAMPEDE trial suggests that there is potential for abiraterone acetate to have health benefits in a population wider than that described by LATITUDE, but agreed that this evidence is not yet mature enough to make a positive recommendation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the existing Special Authority criteria for abiraterone acetate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer stipulates that where patients are previously treated with chemotherapy containing a taxane they must have had prior treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone were funded for newly diagnosed castrate sensitive or hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer, that this criterion should not be changed. However, the Subcommittee considered that amendment should be made to preclude prior abiraterone treatment for patients who have not received prior taxane chemotherapy. The Subcommittee considered that patients should be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate only once, either for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC or for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, as there is a lack of evidence to support a further line of abiraterone treatment following relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC that there would likely be a decrease in the use of docetaxel and bicalutamide. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC subject to the eligibility criteria in LATITUDE, that the patient number estimates provided by the supplier were reasonable (n = 113 in year 1, increasing to n\u00a0=\u00a0520 in year 5). The Subcommittee considered that uptake of abiraterone acetate in these populations would be high as there would likely be a preference for abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT over ADT and docetaxel. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate, in combination with prednisone and ADT, for the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC provided by LATITUDE, was of moderate to high quality, and that there is a need for an alternative treatment option for these patients. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC, that the Special Authority criteria should reflect the eligibility criteria of the LATITUDE trial.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that abiraterone acetate has been funded for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer since 2015.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the recommended dosage of abiraterone acetate is 1000 mg orally as a single daily dose in combination with 10 mg (either once daily or as 5 mg twice daily) prednisone or prednisolone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the key clinical evidence for abiraterone acetate in mHNPC and mHSPC is provided by the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 LATITUDE trial, which investigated the efficacy of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with ADT in 1199 patients with newly diagnosed, hormone na\u00efve castration sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. The Subcommittee noted that high risk was defined as two or more of the following: Gleason Score \u2265 8, 3 or more lesions on bone scan, and/or visceral metastases (excluding nodes). The Subcommittee noted the design of the LATITUDE trial and the results of the interim analysis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578607\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:352-60</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the trial was unblinded, to allow crossover, as a result of the findings of the interim analysis. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial, which was not available at the time PTAC reviewed the application in November 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:686-700</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 51.8 months, the median overall survival was 53.3 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 36.5 months in the placebo group (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that 275 deaths (46%) had occurred in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 343 (57%) in the placebo group. The Subcommittee noted that compared with placebo, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone improved time to skeletal related events (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; <i>P</i>=0.0181), time to chemotherapy initiation (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), time to subsequent prostate cancer therapy (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.53; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), and time to prostate-specific antigen progression (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.36; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis, 72 patients had crossed over from placebo to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted safety data from the final overall survival analysis of the LATITUDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987939\" target=\"_blank\">Fizazi et al. 2019</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 21% [n\u00a0=\u00a0125], placebo 10% [n = 60], crossover 4% [n = 3]) and hypokalaemia (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 12% [n\u00a0=\u00a070], placebo 2% [n = 10], crossover 3% [n = 2]). The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a030) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 13) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee noted that treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 4% (n\u00a0=\u00a024) of patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 2% (n = 11) in the placebo group, and 1% (n = 1) in the crossover group. The Subcommittee considered that no new safety signals were identified.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the patient-reported outcome and health-related quality of life analysis of the LATITUDE trial after a median follow-up of 30.9 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326030\" target=\"_blank\">Chi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:194-206</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the analysis included the Brief Pain Inventory\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Short Form, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate scale (FACT-P), and the EuroQoL questionnaire. The Subcommittee noted that adherence was 90% or higher for all patient reported outcome measurement tools. The Subcommittee noted that the median time to deterioration of functional status according to FACT-P was 12.9 months in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, compared with 8.3 months in the placebo group (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; <i>P</i>=0.032). The Subcommittee noted that the median time to pain interference progression was not reached in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group compared with 18.4 months in the placebo group (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.80; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional evidence for the use of abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT is provided by Arm G of the open-label, multi-arm, multi-stage, Phase 2-3 STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578639\" target=\"_blank\">James et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;377:338-51</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ARM G contained four groups of patients: 50% of patients were those with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 20% were men with newly diagnosed node positive but not otherwise metastatic prostate cancer, approximately 27% were those with newly diagnosed but node negative high risk locally advanced prostate cancer (high risk defined as T3,4 disease; Gleason 8 \u2013 10, PSA \u2265 40 nG/mL); and a final group of men previously treated with radical surgery or brachytherapy no longer receiving therapy and newly relapsing with high risk features and that this was the smallest group (&lt;5% in both arms).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that for the whole study population the 3-year survival was 83% in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm (Arm G), compared with 76% in the ADT-alone arm (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.76; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that failure free survival time in the abiraterone acetate with prednisolone and ADT arm was 43.9 months, compared with 30.0 months in the ADT-alone arm, that the 3-year progression-free survival was 80% compared with 62% (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and that the 3-year rate without symptomatic skeletal events was 88% compared with 78% (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.47; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that among the 1476 patients in the safety population in the relevant sub-analysis of STAMPEDE in whom progression had not occurred within the first year, the prevalence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 15% among patients who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT, compared with 11% in the ADT alone group. The Subcommittee noted that the main adverse events that occurred over and above the control therapy were hypertension, mild increases in aminotransferase levels, and respiratory disorders.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the patient population in STAMPEDE differed from the patients in LATITUDE; STAMPEDE included patients with non-metastatic disease and patients with high-risk disease defined by different criteria. The Subcommittee considered that this limits the value of direct comparison between the trials. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no head-to-head trial comparing abiraterone plus ADT with docetaxel plus ADT, but did identify three network meta\u2011analyses that indirectly compared the agents (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218976\" target=\"_blank\">Feyerabend et al. Eur J Cancer. 2018;103:78-87</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037513\" target=\"_blank\">Wallis et al. Eur Urol. 2018;73:834-44</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788164\" target=\"_blank\">Vale et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1249-57</a>). The Subcommittee noted that Feyerabend et al (2018) reported that abiraterone plus prednisone and ADT is at least as effective in reducing the risk of death as docetaxel plus ADT; and was reportedly better at preventing disease progression and improving quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that Wallis et al (2018) reported that there was no significant difference in overall survival between abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT and docetaxel plus ADT. The Subcommittee noted that Vale et al (2018) reported that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone appears to be the most effective treatment, although considered it was not clear whether this is due to an increased benefit or variation in the trials included. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a direct, randomised comparison of abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone and ADT with docetaxel plus ADT was conducted as part of the STAMPEDE trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961425/\" target=\"_blank\">Sydes et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1235-1248</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this was not a formally powered comparison. The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of 4 years, there were 44/189 (23%) deaths in the docetaxel arm and 105/377 (28%) deaths in the abiraterone acetate arm (all patients: overall survival HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.65; patients with metastatic disease: overall survival HR=1.13; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that guidelines from NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend that abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT are appropriate for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive disease who are fit enough to receive these agents.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that metastatic prostate cancer in New Zealand is primarily diagnosed by a positive bone scan or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI, and that these were the criteria used for eligibility in the LATITUDE trial. The Subcommittee noted that gallium-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (PSMA) PET imaging is a diagnostic tool available privately in New Zealand that has better specificity and sensitivity than standard imaging modalities for detecting metastatic prostate cancer. The Subcommittee considered that there is pressure to more widely introduce PSMA PET technology, and that this has potential consequences for equity due to variable access as patients who are able to access PSMA-PET could qualify for treatment earlier in their disease course. The Subcommittee also considered that it is unclear at this time whether metastatic disease diagnosed using PSMA PET imaging is comparable with metastatic disease diagnosed using conventional imaging modalities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted PTAC\u2019s recommendation that abiraterone acetate, for use in combination with prednisone and ADT in a wider group of patients than those meeting the eligibility criteria for the LATITUDE trial, be deferred until additional data in these settings is available. The Subcommittee considered that the data from the STAMPEDE trial suggests that there is potential for abiraterone acetate to have health benefits in a population wider than that described by LATITUDE, but agreed that this evidence is not yet mature enough to make a positive recommendation. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the existing Special Authority criteria for abiraterone acetate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer stipulates that where patients are previously treated with chemotherapy containing a taxane they must have had prior treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone were funded for newly diagnosed castrate sensitive or hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer, that this criterion should not be changed. However, the Subcommittee considered that amendment should be made to preclude prior abiraterone treatment for patients who have not received prior taxane chemotherapy. The Subcommittee considered that patients should be eligible to receive abiraterone acetate only once, either for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC or for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, as there is a lack of evidence to support a further line of abiraterone treatment following relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC that there would likely be a decrease in the use of docetaxel and bicalutamide. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC subject to the eligibility criteria in LATITUDE, that the patient number estimates provided by the supplier were reasonable (n = 113 in year 1, increasing to n\u00a0=\u00a0520 in year 5). The Subcommittee considered that uptake of abiraterone acetate in these populations would be high as there would likely be a preference for abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone and ADT over ADT and docetaxel. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate, in combination with prednisone and ADT, for the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC and mHSPC provided by LATITUDE, was of moderate to high quality, and that there is a need for an alternative treatment option for these patients. The Subcommittee considered that if abiraterone acetate was to be funded for newly diagnosed high risk mHNPC/mHSPC, that the Special Authority criteria should reflect the eligibility criteria of the LATITUDE trial.</p>",
