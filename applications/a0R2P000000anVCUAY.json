The Subcommittee noted that it can also be potentially life-threatening to the mother and foetus (e.g. hyperemesis gravidarum which affects fewer than 2% of pregnant women). The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence that Pacific people experience higher rates of hyperemesis gravidarum itself and higher rates of hospitalisation due to hyperemesis gravidarum (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7566763\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan et al.

The Subcommittee considered that in general people who are pregnant may be more risk averse when considering medications than people who are not pregnant. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are a range of currently funded pharmaceuticals that may be used in standard of care for nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, including metoclopramide, pyridoxine, chlorpromazine, cyclizine, promethazine and ondansetron. The Subcommittee considered that the health need of patients with nausea or vomiting of pregnancy can be met by the currently available treatment options.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine and that there are a range of doxylamine combination products and tablets available internationally and over the counter in New Zealand (eg for the treatment of cold and \u2018flu symptoms). The Subcommittee noted that the only single agent doxylamine product approved in New Zealand is indicated for temporary use for insomnia and is available as 25 mg gel capsules that cannot be divided. The Subcommittee noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has proposed several doxylamine dosing regimens ranging from 30 mg to 40 mg per day (12.5 mg three to four times per day, or 10 mg in the morning, 10 mg mid-afternoon and 20 mg at bedtime, or 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime) for the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy. The Subcommittee considered that 25 mg gel capsules would be unsuitable for use in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy where dose adjustment and division may be needed. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is no Medsafe-approved doxylamine product that is registered for the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, and that there is no single-agent doxylamine product registered for this indication in any country. The Subcommittee noted that registered products undergo Medsafe\u2019s assessment of efficacy and safety, and the Subcommittee considered that certainty of a product\u2019s quality, safety and risk of teratogenic effects (abnormalities due to foetal exposure) is important for potential use in pregnancy.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine has been proposed by the applicants to be used either as a first-line treatment in combination with pyridoxine, or as a second-line treatment following failure of conservative treatment. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the applicants\u2019 rationale for doxylamine use in pregnancy is that it is considered safe compared to other products and noted that doxylamine is approved by the FDA for this indication (Diclegis combination product [doxylamine 10 mg, pyridoxine 10 mg, delayed-release tablet] indicated for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management (<a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021876s002lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Diclegis Highlights of Prescribing Information.

There was a significant reduction in vomiting with ondansetron, also assessed using the VAS (median VAS decreased 41 [IQR 17 to 57] compared with 17 [-4 to 38]; <i>P</i>=0.049).

The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine has a variety of dosing regimens and considered that the applicant\u2019s estimated daily dose of 25 mg would be too low for modelling purposes, therefore the likely cost would be higher although the optimal dosing remains uncertain. The Subcommittee noted that even with costs offset by reduced use of funded alternatives, doxylamine costs significantly more per pregnancy than pyridoxine 50 mg three times daily (approximately $4.90), metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily (approximately $2.30) and for ondansetron 8 mg three times daily (approximately $17.20) for an equivalent time period.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC estimate approximately 740 to 2,200 people would likely access doxylamine were it to be funded in New Zealand for this indication.

The Subcommittee noted that the only single agent doxylamine product approved in New Zealand is indicated for temporary use for insomnia and is available as 25 mg gel capsules that cannot be divided. The Subcommittee noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has proposed several doxylamine dosing regimens ranging from 30 mg to 40 mg per day (12.5 mg three to four times per day, or 10 mg in the morning, 10 mg mid-afternoon and 20 mg at bedtime, or 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime) for the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy.

The Subcommittee made this recommendation within the context of anti nausea treatments based on the current health need of this patient group (noting the availability of funded alternative treatments), the poor evidence of benefit from doxylamine (noting the lack of comparative evidence against other antiemetics), the likely high cost of this medicine compared to funded alternatives, and the lack of a registered product for safe use in pregnancy. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee <b>recommended</b> that PHARMAC provide a copy of the record for this item to the Reproductive and Sexual Health Subcommittee for their information.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that it can also be potentially life-threatening to the mother and foetus (e.g. hyperemesis gravidarum which affects fewer than 2% of pregnant women). The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence that Pacific people experience higher rates of hyperemesis gravidarum itself and higher rates of hospitalisation due to hyperemesis gravidarum (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7566763\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan et al.

The Subcommittee considered that in general people who are pregnant may be more risk averse when considering medications than people who are not pregnant. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are a range of currently funded pharmaceuticals that may be used in standard of care for nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, including metoclopramide, pyridoxine, chlorpromazine, cyclizine, promethazine and ondansetron. The Subcommittee considered that the health need of patients with nausea or vomiting of pregnancy can be met by the currently available treatment options.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine and that there are a range of doxylamine combination products and tablets available internationally and over the counter in New Zealand (eg for the treatment of cold and \u2018flu symptoms). The Subcommittee noted that the only single agent doxylamine product approved in New Zealand is indicated for temporary use for insomnia and is available as 25 mg gel capsules that cannot be divided. The Subcommittee noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has proposed several doxylamine dosing regimens ranging from 30 mg to 40 mg per day (12.5 mg three to four times per day, or 10 mg in the morning, 10 mg mid-afternoon and 20 mg at bedtime, or 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime) for the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy. The Subcommittee considered that 25 mg gel capsules would be unsuitable for use in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy where dose adjustment and division may be needed. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is no Medsafe-approved doxylamine product that is registered for the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, and that there is no single-agent doxylamine product registered for this indication in any country. The Subcommittee noted that registered products undergo Medsafe\u2019s assessment of efficacy and safety, and the Subcommittee considered that certainty of a product\u2019s quality, safety and risk of teratogenic effects (abnormalities due to foetal exposure) is important for potential use in pregnancy.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine has been proposed by the applicants to be used either as a first-line treatment in combination with pyridoxine, or as a second-line treatment following failure of conservative treatment. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the applicants\u2019 rationale for doxylamine use in pregnancy is that it is considered safe compared to other products and noted that doxylamine is approved by the FDA for this indication (Diclegis combination product [doxylamine 10 mg, pyridoxine 10 mg, delayed-release tablet] indicated for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management (<a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021876s002lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Diclegis Highlights of Prescribing Information.

There was a significant reduction in vomiting with ondansetron, also assessed using the VAS (median VAS decreased 41 [IQR 17 to 57] compared with 17 [-4 to 38]; <i>P</i>=0.049). There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events between the two treatment groups.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that evaluate the effectiveness of doxylamine succinate 10 mg-pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg delayed-release preparation, administered as two tablets daily) compared with placebo for 14 days in 256 adult women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy who were between seven to 14 weeks pregnant and had not responded to conservative management with dietary and lifestyle advice (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843504\" target=\"_blank\">Koren et al.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2015;9:CD007575</a></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence base for doxylamine in the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy consists of two randomised, controlled, clinical trials and assorted other evidence such as case studies and guidelines. The Subcommittee considered that the guidelines were based on variable, low-quality evidence, and noted that the authors of the Cochrane review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy stated that there was insufficient evidence to support any particular intervention.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there was insufficient information about the risk of teratogenic effects from doxylamine use in pregnancy. The Subcommittee noted that the current clinical practice guidelines and pathways in New Zealand lead to use of ondansetron for patients with severe nausea or vomiting of pregnancy that is not responsive to other treatments, and considered that based on recent meta-analyses, ondansetron is not known to cause teratogenic effects. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered there is variation between prescribers and DHBs and noted that, contrary to the New Zealand practice guidelines, survey results from one applicant indicate that ondansetron is one of several agents used for first-line treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Members considered that ondansetron use in this setting is less than that of pyridoxine, metoclopramide, promethazine, cyclizine and prochlorperazine.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the clinical trial evidence did not provide sufficient comparative safety and efficacy data because the trials used comparators that may not be used for standard of care in New Zealand patients with nausea or vomiting of pregnancy (ondansetron as a first-line treatment, and placebo as a second-line treatment following failure of conservative treatment). The Subcommittee considered that overall, the evidence was poor and that there was no strong evidence to support a benefit of doxylamine compared to other funded treatment options in the treatment of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, and that there was no evidence of a greater benefit in any particular subgroup. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine (as a proprietary product in combination with pyridoxine hydrochloride) has been considered for funding in Scotland and Wales for the management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy but was not recommended for funding by those agencies due to insufficient cost-effectiveness data. The Subcommittee noted that guidance on use of doxylamine/pyridoxine from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK) states that it is a more costly option for patients for whom conservative management is ineffective and that there is no evidence of how the safety and efficacy of doxylamine/pyridoxine compares to first-line treatment options (eg antihistamines and phenothiazines). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the applicant has proposed doxylamine would be used at a daily dose of 25 mg once daily; if used for 60 days, this would cost approximately $72 per pregnancy and would result in a gross cost of approximately $160,000 to the Pharmaceutical Budget for the treatment of 2,200 people per year. The Subcommittee noted that doxylamine has a variety of dosing regimens and considered that the applicant\u2019s estimated daily dose of 25 mg would be too low for modelling purposes, therefore the likely cost would be higher although the optimal dosing remains uncertain. The Subcommittee noted that even with costs offset by reduced use of funded alternatives, doxylamine costs significantly more per pregnancy than pyridoxine 50 mg three times daily (approximately $4.90), metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily (approximately $2.30) and for ondansetron 8 mg three times daily (approximately $17.20) for an equivalent time period.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC estimate approximately 740 to 2,200 people would likely access doxylamine were it to be funded in New Zealand for this indication. The Subcommittee considered that the true proportion of severe cases in New Zealand would impact on the estimate of the total number of people seeking pharmaceutical treatment. The Subcommittee considered that the true number of patients likely to access doxylamine may be higher than PHARMAC had estimated if there was a clinical view that doxylamine was safer than other funded treatment options.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if doxylamine were funded for nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, it would be used predominantly as a second-line or third-line treatment (with some first-line use) and that it would be used in combination with other pharmaceuticals, although it would replace some other antiemetics. The Subcommittee considered that PHARMAC could separately model first-line use and second-line use of doxylamine in any economic assessments undertaken. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment may continue for up to three months, rather than 60 days estimated by PHARMAC staff. The Subcommittee considered that the appropriate comparator for modelling purposes would be any of the other currently funded antiemetics that are commonly used for this indication in New Zealand (ie not placebo), or if considered for funding as cost-neutral to another agent then either metoclopramide or pyridoxine would be appropriate comparators. <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence that the use of doxylamine would prevent hospitalisations or presentation to emergency departments, compared to other funded antiemetics. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if doxylamine were to be funded without restriction, it is likely that prescribers would continue to use medicines that they are experienced with, although some would be strongly in favour of doxylamine. The Subcommittee considered that additional use of doxylamine in patients with insomnia would be likely due to the withdrawal of doxepin and dothiepin.</p>",
