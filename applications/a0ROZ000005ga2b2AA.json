The Subcommittee considered that rates of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are likely to increase over time and associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The Subcommittee considered that these risk factors may disproportionately effect groups of people currently experiencing disparities in access to healthcare. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are currently no funded, targeted pharmacological treatments for the first line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The Subcommittee noted that current treatments include radical therapy (such as surgery, liver transplant or radiofrequency ablation), for patients with early stage disease (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0 or A), trans arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for patients with intermediate stage disease (BCLC B), and best supportive care for patients with BCLC B stage disease that is unsuitable for TACE, and\u00a0end stage disease (BCLC C and D).

The Subcommittee noted that no statistically significant difference in overall survival was observed between the lenvatinib group and sorafenib group, hazard ratio (HR) 0\u00b792, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0\u00b779\u20131\u00b706. The Subcommittee noted that significant differences, favouring lenvatinib, were observed between groups in the secondary outcomes of median progression free survival (HR 0\u00b766, 95% CI: 0\u00b757\u22120\u00b777, p&lt;0\u00b70001), median time to progression (HR 0\u00b763, 95% CI: 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b773, p&lt;0\u00b70001) and objective response rate (odds ratio 3\u00b713, 95% CI: 2\u00b715\u20134\u00b756, p&lt;0\u00b70001).

The Subcommittee noted the results of this indirect analysis indicated that compared with placebo, lenvatinib showed a general trend toward greater efficacy: HR for overall survival of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50-0.80), progression free survival 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30-0.49), and objective response rate of 56.49 (95% CI: 4.53-704.99).

The Subcommittee considered that if lenvatinib were funded in this indication, it would be appropriate to assume an uptake rate of 90%. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, should lenvatinib be funded in this indication then it may be used as a bridge to liver transplantation, and considered that PHARMAC could seek further advice on this from transplantation clinicians. The Subcommittee considered that, should lenvatinib be funded for this indication then there may be a modest increase in health resource required to manage adverse events, largely use of loperamide to manage diarrhoea.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is emerging evidence for atezolizumab and bevacizumab in this indication and that it would be interested to review data for additional classes of medicines, given the unmet need in this patient group.</p>",
