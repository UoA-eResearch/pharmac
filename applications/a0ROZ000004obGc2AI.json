The Subcommittee noted that historically patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck (HNSCC) had been of older age with an extensive history of smoking and alcohol use. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the number of patients diagnosed with HNSCC with these characteristics is changing worldwide and in New Zealand, patients diagnosed with HNSCC are younger, have less exposure to alcohol and smoking, and there is a high incidence (about 78% of cases) of human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer consistent with international increases in HPV-positive disease (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5648183/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Lucas-Roxburgh et al. PLoS One. 2017;12:e0186424</b></a>). The Subcommittee considered that the future incidence of HNSCC was uncertain, given the current substantial increase in incident cases but countered by the future effects of HPV vaccination programmes. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients with <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">tumour suppressor protein </span>p16-positive (HPV-associated) HNSCC have a relatively good prognosis, however, prognosis varies according to different AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> edition disease stages, with about two-thirds of patients with HNSCC having higher-stage disease (eg stage III and IV) at diagnosis, with likely five-year survival of about 50% for stage III and 20-40% for stage IV disease (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21389\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Lydiatt et al.

The Subcommittee considered that PD-L1 CPS testing would require substantial laboratory investment, implementation and training. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is no data to indicate whether patients with HNSCC who have PD-L1 CPS of \u22651 have a different health need to those with CPS &lt;1.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a correlation between HPV and PD-L1 positivity, and considered that more than 85% of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC may have PD-L1 CPS &gt;1 given the increasing incidence of HPV-positive disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that fit patients with HPV-positive HNSCC may be suitable for treatment with curative intent, although the effects of first-line therapy can be challenging for patients; those with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC have limited treatment options generally associated with a short duration of efficacy, leading to a progressive decline and death. The Subcommittee considered that the health of families/wh\u0101nau of the population with HPV-positive HNSCC could also be affected by HNSCC, due to its the impact of the disease and its treatment on the earning potential of the patient.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is no one current standard of care treatment for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in New Zealand, and that treatment may include weekly taxane (usually paclitaxel) in the large group of younger, fit patients with HPV-positive disease, or cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in a smaller proportion of patients (fit, older patients without significant comorbidities; about one quarter of cases), although some patients would decline or be too unwell for second line treatment and be managed supportively with palliative care. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in 2017 there were 553 registrations for HNSCC (ICD C00-C14), with age-standardised registration rates of 11.1 and 5.1 per 100,000 for males and females respectively, and there were 136 deaths due to HNSCC in 2013 (2.7 and 1.2 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively, age-standardised; <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/cancer-new-registrations-and-deaths-2013\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Ministry of Health, 2016</b></a>). The Subcommittee considered that increasing registration rates over time were consistent with increasing incidence worldwide, and that the stable (or possibly decreased) mortality rate was related to the curative treatment of an increasingly HPV-positive population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that age-standardised incidence rates of oropharyngeal HNSCC are higher for M\u0101ori (relative risk 1.4) and for people in areas of higher deprivation (relative risk 2.7) than non-M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.12352\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Chelimo et al. Aust N Z J Public Health. 2015;39:162-7</b></a>). The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori have worse survival from HNSCC than non-M\u0101ori, and that timely access to treatment is a factor (<a href=\"https://www.nzno.org.nz/Portals/0/Files/Documents/Groups/Cancer%20Nurses/2020_05_19%20Head-and-Neck-Cancer-quality-performance-indicators-draft-for-review-5_04_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Cancer Control Agency. 2020.

The Subcommittee considered that Pacific people also have a high relative risk of acquiring HPV-associated HNSCC.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the findings of the GLANCE study, an international review of treatment and outcomes in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC that was funded by MSD (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1368-8375(19)30436-1\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Grunwald et al. Oral Oncol. 2020;102:104526</b></a>). The Subcommittee noted that GLANCE included a small proportion (30%, N = 221) with oropharyngeal disease, of which 25% (N = 56) were tested for HPV status and 15% (N = 35) were p16 positive. The Subcommittee considered that survival of the GLANCE population after relapse (median OS 8.0 months in patients who received cetuximab + platinum +/- 5-fluorouracil) was influenced by the disease of that population, which was different to that of the current New Zealand population with HNSCC.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab was proposed as a first-line treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, either as monotherapy in the population with PD-L1 combined positive score [CPS] \u22651, or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil for all patients irrespective of PD-L1 CPS. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab is approved by Medsafe for several oncology indications and is currently being evaluated by Medsafe for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The Subcommittee noted that at the time of submission, the application for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC was considered to meet PHARMAC\u2019s criteria for consideration under the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/cancer-medicine-funding-parallel-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>parallel assessment</b></a><b> </b>pathway, which provides for consideration of cancer medicines at the same time as they are assessed by Medsafe.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the key evidence for pembrolizumab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC comes from the three arm, open-label, randomised, phase III Keynote-048 trial of pembrolizumab alone vs pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil vs cetuximab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil in 882 patients with SCC of the oropharynx (about 38%), oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679945/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Burtness et al. Lancet. 2019;394:1915-28</b></a>).</p><p>1.14.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that median follow-up in Keynote-048 was 11.5 months, 13 months, and 10.7 months for the three treatment groups, respectively; these median values were the same at the second interim analysis and at the final analysis. The Subcommittee considered these analyses were performed early relative to expected outcomes in HNSCC but that this follow-up may have been skewed by crossover, as almost half of patients in each arm received subsequent anticancer therapy.</p><p>1.14.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that Keynote-048 included known p16 status for patients with oropharyngeal disease (positive in ~20% of the trial population), stratified patients by PD-L1 expression (50% threshold) based on the IHC 22C3 assay which is not used in New Zealand, and tested PD-L1 CPS. The Subcommittee considered that the baseline characteristics of trial participants represented a historical profile of HNSCC which would make the results difficult to interpret for current and future HNSCC patients as the profile continues to evolve.</p><p>1.14.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered three-weekly until progression, intolerable toxicity or for a maximum of 35 cycles.

The Subcommittee noted that GLANCE included a small proportion (30%, N = 221) with oropharyngeal disease, of which 25% (N = 56) were tested for HPV status and 15% (N = 35) were p16 positive. The Subcommittee considered that survival of the GLANCE population after relapse (median OS 8.0 months in patients who received cetuximab + platinum +/- 5-fluorouracil) was influenced by the disease of that population, which was different to that of the current New Zealand population with HNSCC.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab was proposed as a first-line treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, either as monotherapy in the population with PD-L1 combined positive score [CPS] \u22651, or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil for all patients irrespective of PD-L1 CPS. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab is approved by Medsafe for several oncology indications and is currently being evaluated by Medsafe for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

Lancet. 2019;394:1915-28</b></a>).</p><p>1.14.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that median follow-up in Keynote-048 was 11.5 months, 13 months, and 10.7 months for the three treatment groups, respectively; these median values were the same at the second interim analysis and at the final analysis. The Subcommittee considered these analyses were performed early relative to expected outcomes in HNSCC but that this follow-up may have been skewed by crossover, as almost half of patients in each arm received subsequent anticancer therapy.</p><p>1.14.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that Keynote-048 included known p16 status for patients with oropharyngeal disease (positive in ~20% of the trial population), stratified patients by PD-L1 expression (50% threshold) based on the IHC 22C3 assay which is not used in New Zealand, and tested PD-L1 CPS. The Subcommittee considered that the baseline characteristics of trial participants represented a historical profile of HNSCC which would make the results difficult to interpret for current and future HNSCC patients as the profile continues to evolve.</p><p>1.14.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered three-weekly until progression, intolerable toxicity or for a maximum of 35 cycles. The Subcommittee noted that the Keynote-048 trial provided no evidence for any difference in risks or benefits between pembrolizumab dosing regimens (ie 200 mg three-weekly vs 400 mg six-weekly). </p><p>1.14.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that Keynote-048 used cetuximab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil (the EXTREME regimen) as comparator, and considered this was not applicable to New Zealand patients with HNSCC as cetuximab is not funded in this setting.</p><p>1.14.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that Keynote-048 had 14 primary hypotheses with hypothesis testing both sequentially and in parallel, however, the specific methodology and analysis rules were hard to locate. The Subcommittee noted that the statistical plan was based on the aggregated patient population without subgroup analysis (eg of HPV-positive oropharyngeal disease) and was complicated by the number of outcomes, treatment arms and analyses (two interim and one final), risking type 1 error conflation. The Subcommittee considered that the primary hypothesis was likely exploratory in nature, the validity of the approach was unclear, and the alpha may have been overspent in multiple analyses. </p><p>1.14.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that 12-month overall survival (OS) in Keynote-048 was 57% with pembrolizumab alone vs 44% with cetuximab and chemotherapy and was 35% vs 19%, respectively, at 24 months in the CPS \u22651 population. The Subcommittee noted that OS in the total population was 53% with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy vs 44% with cetuximab and chemotherapy at 12 months and 29% vs 19% at 24 months, respectively. The Subcommittee considered it was uncertain whether the reported OS benefit would continue or diminish due to heavy censoring of data after 15 months and extrapolation beyond two years<b>, </b>noting that &lt;15% of the starting population were available for follow-up after 2 years.</p><p>1.14.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.2 months with pembrolizumab alone vs 4.9 months with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy; PFS estimates in these two groups were 28% vs 45%, respectively, at 6 months and 20% vs 17% at 12 months, respectively. The Subcommittee noted the data indicated PFS2 (the difference in time after progression before a patient received their next line of treatment) was improved with pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and considered that this suggested some duration of response, although tempered by the data being heavily censored beyond 24 months.</p><p>1.14.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee noted that grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17%, 72%, 69% of patients who received pembrolizumab alone, pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and cetuximab with chemotherapy, respectively. The Subcommittee noted that there were 3 (1%), 11 (4%) and 8 (3%) treatment-related deaths reported in patients who received pembrolizumab alone, pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and cetuximab with chemotherapy, respectively. The Subcommittee considered these event rates were as would be expected for this population with decreased health status.</p><p>1.14.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Subcommittee considered that Keynote-048 provided moderate quality evidence suggesting an improvement at 12 months from pembrolizumab for the patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, although whether the benefit was sustained beyond this time-point or diminished was uncertain due to short-term follow-up, and the proposed five-year treatment benefit was therefore uncertain. The Subcommittee considered that the survival data for the Keynote-048 population with HNSCC underrepresented HPV-positive oropharyngeal disease and therefore would not reflect outcomes for the New Zealand patients with predominantly HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC, and considered that these two patient populations represent distinct subtypes, which each having different epidemiology, characteristics and prognosis. The Subcommittee considered that longer term data would be unable to inform this assessment given the limited applicability of data in the trial population to the clinical patient population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an unpublished technical report on a systematic review and meta-analysis that was funded by MSD, which indicated a benefit of pembrolizumab over other agents for first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC. The Subcommittee considered that although the methodology appeared robust, the analysis could have been vulnerable to possible bias due to the influence of the modeller\u2019s decision making regarding assumptions used.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that NICE (England and Wales) had suspended their review of pembrolizumab for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ta10181\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>July 2020</b></a><b>,</b> pending clarification regarding differences between the trial population and the clinical patient population. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if pembrolizumab were funded for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, the majority of uptake would be in younger, fit patients who would receive pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil; and considered that an estimated 3.6% increase in incident cases was likely an underestimate, considering p16 positivity (and therefore HPV-associated disease) in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered there would likely also be uptake in patients with co-morbidities that preclude chemotherapy, and in these patients pembrolizumab would be used as a single agent.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the changing epidemiology of HNSCC in New Zealand would likely mean the proportion of PD-L1 CPS positive patients would be greater than expected. The Subcommittee considered that the prognostic and/or predictive value of PD-L1 in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and the characteristics of an HNSCC population defined by PD-L1 were unclear, due to limited data with inconsistent findings; however, Members noted that there is some evidence to suggest that PD-L1 expression may be higher in HPV-positive HNSCC and that this may be associated with better OS (eg. <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1368-8375(19)30092-2\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Hong et al.

The Subcommittee considered it difficult to quantify the health system costs arising from patients who develop immune-related adverse events, as these patients require substantial clinical management, that varies greatly dependant on the organ at risk and its impacts (eg hepatitis, pneumonitis). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the epidemiology and incidence of HPV-associated malignancies was changing and could decrease in future decades as a result of immunisation programmes, and considered that New Zealanders could benefit from increased uptake of HPV vaccination in certain age groups (eg under 16 or under 20 years).

This recommendation was made based on the consideration of the New Zealand patient population having a high incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer with the patient population with HNSCC in the clinical trial evidence having different epidemiology, characteristics and prognosis; the lack of an appropriate comparator treatment in the key clinical trial evidence for the New Zealand context; and the evidence for short-term outcomes of pembrolizumab only. In making this recommendation, the Subcommittee considered the limited applicability of data in the trial population to the clinical population with HNSCC in New Zealand.</p><p>8.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted correspondence from the supplier in response to the October 2020 recommendation, which included updated data, clarification of the epidemiology and applicability of the data to the New Zealand population, and clinical input from New Zealand clinicians regarding the applicability of the evidence supporting pembrolizumab use in this setting, and the relevance of outcomes to the New Zealand context.</p><p>8.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted information regarding the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging of HNSCC as relevant to Ministry of Health Standard of Care Classifications in New Zealand, as well as a detailed breakdown of the AJCC classification of New Zealand data provided by the applicant. The Subcommittee noted the data was intended to clarify the similarities between the current New Zealand classification of HNSCC disease and the classification of patients recruited to the KEYNOTE-048 study. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier utilised the AJCC codes in an analysis of incident and mortality data for New Zealand and considered that the supplier estimates and projections for this are likely accurate.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that this analysis highlights that oropharyngeal cancer is a subgroup of the HNSCC patient population (comprising approximately 38% of the total HNSCC population, and 30% of deaths from HNSCC), and is not presently the majority of the HNSCC population, as was previously considered. The Subcommittee considered, however that there is a trend towards increases in oropharyngeal disease incidence, such that this subgroup may make up 50% of incident HNSCC cases, and 35% of HNSCC deaths, over the next decade.</p><p>8.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted data from New Zealand studies report that 76-78% of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients have HPV-positivity, the vast majority of which were HPV p16 positive (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049330/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas Roxburgh et al.

The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence that p16 status is a prognostic marker in oropharyngeal HNSCC, where median overall survival of p16-positive relapsing or metastatic oropharyngeal HNSCC was 2.6 years versus 0.8 years for p16-negative patients in a study of 181 relapsing remitting oropharyngeal cancer patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24958820/\" target=\"_blank\">Fakhry et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the oropharyngeal population is a biologically different disease, is the fastest growing population of HNSCC, has a better prognosis at diagnosis in the relapsed/metastatic setting, and is underrepresented in the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The Subcommittee considered that the data extending the benefit from the broader patient population from KEYNOTE-048 to this subpopulation had substantial uncertainties. The Subcommittee noted that the October 2020 assessment took an \u201call or none\u201d approach to the request for funding to all relapsed/metastatic HNSCC leading to a recommendation for decline based on a substantive subpopulation in whom the benefit of therapy remains undetermined.</p><p>8.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated data from the supplier indicates that adding chemotherapy to pembrolizumab treatment increases the response rate in the intention to treat population, as well as in the CPS &gt;1 (median overall survival 13.6 months, 95% CI 10.7 months to 15.5 months versus 10.6 months without pembrolizumab, 95% CI 9.1 months to 11.7 months; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.78; P=0.00001)\u00a0and CPS &gt;20 subgroups (pembrolizumab overall response rate 23.3%; median duration of response 23.4 months [range 2.7 to 54.4+ months] versus without pembrolizumab overall response rate 36.1%; median duration of response 4.2 months [range 1.2 to 38.2+ months]), and that this benefit may be conservative in the New Zealand population due to the use of cetuximab in the control arm. The Subcommittee therefore considered that pembrolizumab administered in combination with chemotherapy was appropriate to maximise the probability of patients responding to treatment.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the structure of the statistical design and control of the type 1 error in KEYNOTE-048 was complex and with over 14 primary hypotheses and noted that modifications of the protocol over time added to the difficulty in interpreting the results.\u00a0</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the updated data from the supplier indicated that the primary endpoints relating to progression-free survival were not met, while the endpoints relating to overall survival were met, with the exception of overall survival in the monotherapy arm of the intention to treatment population. The Subcommittee considered that this indicated that overall survival is likely to be the main benefit from treatment. The Subcommittee considered that an estimated treatment effect of pembrolizumab of 5 years (as proposed by NICE) seems reasonable. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit in overall survival, but not progression-free survival also indicated that there was no strong association between progression-free survival and overall survival in this patient population.\u00a0</p><p>8.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the growth rate in incident patients with HNSCC is unknown but considered that previous estimates of approximately 3.6% seem reasonable. The Subcommittee also considered that the potential increase in the proportion of patients with CPS \u22651 HNSCC is unknown as CPS is not routinely tested for in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that the proportion of patients unfit for chemotherapy (and therefore receiving palliative care instead) was uncertain but likely to be low.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s concerns regarding the previous decline recommendation were valid and reasonable but considered that the reliability of benefit and the alignments of the KEYNOTE-048 patient population and subpopulations to the New Zealand patient population remain unclear, with corresponding uncertainty in benefit. The Subcommittee considered there remained a lack of correlation between progression-free survival and overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that there were financial risks associated with funding an \u201call-comers\u201d patient population, but that these could be reduced by excluding the p16-positive population from the Special Authority criteria due to uncertainty of clinical benefit for these patients.</p><p>8.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The </span>Subcommittee<span style=\"color: black;\"> considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of </span>the<span style=\"color: black;\"> most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information </span>for<span style=\"color: black;\"> pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed or metastatic HNSCC patients.

This recommendation was made based on the consideration of the New Zealand patient population having a high incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer with the patient population with HNSCC in the clinical trial evidence having different epidemiology, characteristics and prognosis; the lack of an appropriate comparator treatment in the key clinical trial evidence for the New Zealand context; and the evidence for short-term outcomes of pembrolizumab only.

The Subcommittee noted the data was intended to clarify the similarities between the current New Zealand classification of HNSCC disease and the classification of patients recruited to the KEYNOTE-048 study. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier utilised the AJCC codes in an analysis of incident and mortality data for New Zealand and considered that the supplier estimates and projections for this are likely accurate.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that this analysis highlights that oropharyngeal cancer is a subgroup of the HNSCC patient population (comprising approximately 38% of the total HNSCC population, and 30% of deaths from HNSCC), and is not presently the majority of the HNSCC population, as was previously considered.

The Subcommittee therefore considered that pembrolizumab administered in combination with chemotherapy was appropriate to maximise the probability of patients responding to treatment.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the structure of the statistical design and control of the type 1 error in KEYNOTE-048 was complex and with over 14 primary hypotheses and noted that modifications of the protocol over time added to the difficulty in interpreting the results.\u00a0</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the updated data from the supplier indicated that the primary endpoints relating to progression-free survival were not met, while the endpoints relating to overall survival were met, with the exception of overall survival in the monotherapy arm of the intention to treatment population. The Subcommittee considered that this indicated that overall survival is likely to be the main benefit from treatment. The Subcommittee considered that an estimated treatment effect of pembrolizumab of 5 years (as proposed by NICE) seems reasonable. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit in overall survival, but not progression-free survival also indicated that there was no strong association between progression-free survival and overall survival in this patient population.\u00a0</p><p>8.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the growth rate in incident patients with HNSCC is unknown but considered that previous estimates of approximately 3.6% seem reasonable. The Subcommittee also considered that the potential increase in the proportion of patients with CPS \u22651 HNSCC is unknown as CPS is not routinely tested for in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that the proportion of patients unfit for chemotherapy (and therefore receiving palliative care instead) was uncertain but likely to be low.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s concerns regarding the previous decline recommendation were valid and reasonable but considered that the reliability of benefit and the alignments of the KEYNOTE-048 patient population and subpopulations to the New Zealand patient population remain unclear, with corresponding uncertainty in benefit. The Subcommittee considered there remained a lack of correlation between progression-free survival and overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that there were financial risks associated with funding an \u201call-comers\u201d patient population, but that these could be reduced by excluding the p16-positive population from the Special Authority criteria due to uncertainty of clinical benefit for these patients.</p><p>8.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The </span>Subcommittee<span style=\"color: black;\"> considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of </span>the<span style=\"color: black;\"> most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information </span>for<span style=\"color: black;\"> pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed or metastatic HNSCC patients.

This recommendation was made based on the consideration of the New Zealand patient population having a high incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer with the patient population with HNSCC in the clinical trial evidence having different epidemiology, characteristics and prognosis; the lack of an appropriate comparator treatment in the key clinical trial evidence for the New Zealand context; and the evidence for short-term outcomes of pembrolizumab only. In making this recommendation, the Subcommittee considered the limited applicability of data in the trial population to the clinical population with HNSCC in New Zealand.</p><p>8.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted correspondence from the supplier in response to the October 2020 recommendation, which included updated data, clarification of the epidemiology and applicability of the data to the New Zealand population, and clinical input from New Zealand clinicians regarding the applicability of the evidence supporting pembrolizumab use in this setting, and the relevance of outcomes to the New Zealand context.</p><p>8.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted information regarding the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging of HNSCC as relevant to Ministry of Health Standard of Care Classifications in New Zealand, as well as a detailed breakdown of the AJCC classification of New Zealand data provided by the applicant. The Subcommittee noted the data was intended to clarify the similarities between the current New Zealand classification of HNSCC disease and the classification of patients recruited to the KEYNOTE-048 study. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier utilised the AJCC codes in an analysis of incident and mortality data for New Zealand and considered that the supplier estimates and projections for this are likely accurate.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.6.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that this analysis highlights that oropharyngeal cancer is a subgroup of the HNSCC patient population (comprising approximately 38% of the total HNSCC population, and 30% of deaths from HNSCC), and is not presently the majority of the HNSCC population, as was previously considered. The Subcommittee considered, however that there is a trend towards increases in oropharyngeal disease incidence, such that this subgroup may make up 50% of incident HNSCC cases, and 35% of HNSCC deaths, over the next decade.</p><p>8.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted data from New Zealand studies report that 76-78% of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients have HPV-positivity, the vast majority of which were HPV p16 positive (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049330/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas Roxburgh et al. PLos One. 2017;12:e0186424</a>). The Subcommittee also noted that previously reviewed publications reported that p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC represent approximately 22% of the patient population (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679945/\" target=\"_blank\">Burtness et al. Lancet. 2019;394:1915-28</a>).</p><p>8.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, in a subgroup analysis provided by the supplier, patients with positive p16 status seemed to do better with pembrolizumab with chemotherapy than with cetuximab-chemotherapy in the total population, the CPS&gt;20 population and the CPS&gt;1 population however there was no evidence of a statistically significant interaction between p16 status and magnitude of overall survival benefit versus cetuximab; p16 positive patients were a minority. The Subcommittee considered that uncertainty remains regarding whether p16-positive patients respond to treatment the same as the dominant patient population.</p><p>8.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that previous comments raised by CaTSoP regarding p16-positive HNSCC were driven by the consensus that it is a biologically different disease than non-p16 positive HNSCC and is increasing in incidence relative to non-p16 HNSCC; however, acknowledged that the overall proportion of p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSCC may have been previously overestimated The Subcommittee considered that there remains under-representation of p16-positive disease within the KEYNOTE-048 trial which means that findings cannot be applied to the p16-positive subgroup with confidence, and thus the benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy for this subgroup is unknown.</p><p>8.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted material provided by the supplier that stated that CPS may be a better predictor of patient outcomes than p16 status; however, considered that there was no evidence provided to support this statement. The Subcommittee noted that there is evidence that p16 status is a prognostic marker in oropharyngeal HNSCC, where median overall survival of p16-positive relapsing or metastatic oropharyngeal HNSCC was 2.6 years versus 0.8 years for p16-negative patients in a study of 181 relapsing remitting oropharyngeal cancer patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24958820/\" target=\"_blank\">Fakhry et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014;32:3365-73</a>). The Subcommittee was not aware of any evidence that p16 status has been explored as a predictive biomarker in checkpoint-inhibition based therapies, and that there is mixed data for prediction with radiotherapy or EGFR-based therapy.</p><p>8.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is uncertainty surrounding whether PD-L1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in HNSCC, noting a large meta-analysis which found evidence that PD-L1 expression was neither positive nor negative prognostically (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30409325/\" target=\"_blank\">Yang et al. Oral Oncol. 2018;86:81-90</a>). The Subcommittee noted that PD-L1 expression testing as a predictive biomarker varies between trials in the types of tests used, the way of testing, which expression cut-offs were used to define subgroups, and in the interpretation of the results. The Subcommittee noted that PD-L1 laboratory testing remains non-interchangeable between the assays and the companion-antibodies used and considered that nationwide training would have to be implemented to ensure consistency should PD-L1 testing be needed for newly funded agents. The Subcommittee noted the availability of supplier sponsored programmes for CPS testing but noted ongoing uncertainty on the extent of training within these programmes, and associated costs.</p><p>8.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted one study which reported that PD-L1 expression may change over time with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34111704/\" target=\"_blank\">Karabajakian et al. Oral Oncol. 2021;119:105368</a>). The Subcommittee considered that this implies that patients may have to be re-biopsied over the course of treatment.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted and agreed with the supplier\u2019s view that HPV vaccination will take many years to impact the incidence of HNSCC in New Zealand but noted that this is likely to translate into an increased proportion of p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSCC in the overall HNSCC population in the short-medium term. The Subcommittee considered that this highlights the risks associated with insufficient evidence of benefit of pembrolizumab for p16-positive disease, and that the use of pembrolizumab may therefore represent an increasing fiscal risk over the short-medium term.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the supplier\u2019s concern regarding 4-year overall survival data not being explicitly addressed in the October 2020 meeting record. The Subcommittee noted published abstracts are generally considered to be low quality evidence when compared to peer reviewed papers and there is a general Subcommittee preference to review peer reviewed publications. The Subcommittee noted that the P-values in the 4-year overall survival analysis provided were nominal values and unadjusted for multiplicity and considered this data should be taken as hypothesis generating results, rather than providing definitive answers about the magnitude of long-term survival benefit.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the statistical plan provided with the submission was complex, compounded by changes in wording over various iterations and amendments associated with hypotheses for progression free survival and overall survival superiority/non-inferiority including changed language from \u2018observed events\u201d to \u201cexpected events\u201d. The Subcommittee noted that the overall survival end point was moved from a secondary to a primary endpoint in a 2016 amendment and the 10% CPS sub-population was dropped from analysis in an amendment made in 2017.</p><p>8.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that updated progression-free survival data provided by the supplier indicates approximately 20% of patients treated with pembrolizumab had not progressed at two years, compared to approximately 10% in the control arm (R Geril KN048 ESMO 2020). The Subcommittee noted that this aligns with the 20% of the oropharyngeal patient population known to be p16-positive, and that these patients typically have a better prognosis, (as indicated by a median overall survival 2-3 years longer than the rest of the HNSCC population). The Subcommittee considered that, as the p16-positive and p16-negative populations are biologically different with different prognostic indicators, mixing the two populations in the analysis meant that interpreting the true benefit of pembrolizumab for either population is difficult.</p><p>8.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the supplier\u2019s concern that review of a network meta-analysis provided in the original submission was not recorded in the October 2020 CaTSoP record (Ramakrishan et al. Technical Report. 2019). The Subcommittee noted that this was reviewed at the time and considered to be low quality evidence and it was not included in the record.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted additional clinician correspondence in response to the October 2020 review of this application. The letter outlined the concerns regarding over-estimation of the p16-positive oropharyngeal patient population at the October 2020 meeting, which the Subcommittee noted and acknowledged. The Subcommittee noted that there remained some uncertainty regarding benefit for the p16-positive subpopulation with under-representation in KEYNOTE-048 and considered an approach to minimise the fiscal risk associated with this uncertainty could be to exclude the population with &lt;1% CPS.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a study by Schoenfeld et al. in which data from KEYNOTE-048 was extracted for Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate the survival of the &lt;1% CPS population which was not provided in the original KEYNOTE-048 manuscript (<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20070888v1.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Schoenfeld et al. Oral Oncol. 2020;105:104762</a>). The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab with chemotherapy may be more beneficial for CPS&lt;1 patients than pembrolizumab with chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.19.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the clinician\u2019s comments regarding the impact of HPV vaccination on HNSCC incidence and agreed that it is unlikely to have a near-term impact but could be a growing proportion of the biologic subtype of HNSCC.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">8.19.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the control arm of the KEYNOTE-048 trial included treatment with cetuximab, which is not a funded agent in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that the results from KEYNOTE-048 may thus underestimate the potential benefit for the New Zealand population who cannot access cetuximab.</p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Subcommittee agreed with the supplier\u2019s updated analysis of the epidemiology of HNSCC in New Zealand, and that oropharyngeal HNSCC at present does not represent the majority of cases of relapsed/metastatic HNSCC. The Subcommittee considered that the oropharyngeal population is a biologically different disease, is the fastest growing population of HNSCC, has a better prognosis at diagnosis in the relapsed/metastatic setting, and is underrepresented in the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The Subcommittee considered that the data extending the benefit from the broader patient population from KEYNOTE-048 to this subpopulation had substantial uncertainties. The Subcommittee noted that the October 2020 assessment took an \u201call or none\u201d approach to the request for funding to all relapsed/metastatic HNSCC leading to a recommendation for decline based on a substantive subpopulation in whom the benefit of therapy remains undetermined.</p><p>8.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated data from the supplier indicates that adding chemotherapy to pembrolizumab treatment increases the response rate in the intention to treat population, as well as in the CPS &gt;1 (median overall survival 13.6 months, 95% CI 10.7 months to 15.5 months versus 10.6 months without pembrolizumab, 95% CI 9.1 months to 11.7 months; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.78; P=0.00001)\u00a0and CPS &gt;20 subgroups (pembrolizumab overall response rate 23.3%; median duration of response 23.4 months [range 2.7 to 54.4+ months] versus without pembrolizumab overall response rate 36.1%; median duration of response 4.2 months [range 1.2 to 38.2+ months]), and that this benefit may be conservative in the New Zealand population due to the use of cetuximab in the control arm. The Subcommittee therefore considered that pembrolizumab administered in combination with chemotherapy was appropriate to maximise the probability of patients responding to treatment.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered the structure of the statistical design and control of the type 1 error in KEYNOTE-048 was complex and with over 14 primary hypotheses and noted that modifications of the protocol over time added to the difficulty in interpreting the results.\u00a0</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the updated data from the supplier indicated that the primary endpoints relating to progression-free survival were not met, while the endpoints relating to overall survival were met, with the exception of overall survival in the monotherapy arm of the intention to treatment population. The Subcommittee considered that this indicated that overall survival is likely to be the main benefit from treatment. The Subcommittee considered that an estimated treatment effect of pembrolizumab of 5 years (as proposed by NICE) seems reasonable. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit in overall survival, but not progression-free survival also indicated that there was no strong association between progression-free survival and overall survival in this patient population.\u00a0</p><p>8.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the growth rate in incident patients with HNSCC is unknown but considered that previous estimates of approximately 3.6% seem reasonable. The Subcommittee also considered that the potential increase in the proportion of patients with CPS \u22651 HNSCC is unknown as CPS is not routinely tested for in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that the proportion of patients unfit for chemotherapy (and therefore receiving palliative care instead) was uncertain but likely to be low.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s concerns regarding the previous decline recommendation were valid and reasonable but considered that the reliability of benefit and the alignments of the KEYNOTE-048 patient population and subpopulations to the New Zealand patient population remain unclear, with corresponding uncertainty in benefit. The Subcommittee considered there remained a lack of correlation between progression-free survival and overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that there were financial risks associated with funding an \u201call-comers\u201d patient population, but that these could be reduced by excluding the p16-positive population from the Special Authority criteria due to uncertainty of clinical benefit for these patients.</p><p>8.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The </span>Subcommittee<span style=\"color: black;\"> considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of </span>the<span style=\"color: black;\"> most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information </span>for<span style=\"color: black;\"> pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed or metastatic HNSCC patients.
