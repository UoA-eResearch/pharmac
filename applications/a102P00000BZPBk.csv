The Committee considered that the evidence from APHINITY and evidence of non-inferiority between SC and IV in FeDeriCa were most relevant but lacked rigor in their trial designs. The Committee considered there was some uncertainty in whether there would be non-inferiority in a clinical context, although noted the non-inferiority reported according to the FeDeriCa definitions and endpoints. The Committee considered the evidence to be broadly relevant to the New Zealand population with eBC, although the trials did not include New Zealand participants.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>On balance, the Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume non-inferiority of IV and SC for metastatic disease, however, considered that the benefit from pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC over standard of care treatment with IV trastuzumab and chemotherapy for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of eBC was unclear from the evidence provided. The Committee therefore considered that it should defer the application for adjuvant treatment until publication of the APHINITY final OS analysis in 2024 and should defer its consideration of the neoadjuvant indication pending CTAC’s assessment of the additional data provided for pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.</p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that any time savings from SC treatment duration compared with that of IV administration would be small and not likely meaningful in the context of current healthcare constraints (ie unlikely to free up resources such as beds and staff time by switching from IV to SC). The Committee noted that some treatments that could feasibly be given in primary care are currently given in secondary care to address delivery needs where there is no package of care available for implementation nor capitated funding. The Committee considered that there would be a resource impact even if SC treatment were able to be given in the community, likely conveying an opportunity cost on general practice. The Committee noted that it was not a safety issue preventing primary care administration of infusions, rather increased capacity would be required as the same infusion services would deliver either SC or IV treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was the potential for a proactive community treatment plan in future in collaboration with Te Whatu Ora, linking to the overall health strategy and including provincial centres for access to a range of treatments (eg inflammatory diseases).

The Committee considered competition for pertuzumab would also be anticipated following patent expiry for this agent, although the Committee noted there were still active patents in New Zealand for the innovator IV pertuzumab.

The Committee considered that the evidence from APHINITY and evidence of non-inferiority between SC and IV in FeDeriCa were most relevant but lacked rigor in their trial designs. The Committee considered there was some uncertainty in whether there would be non-inferiority in a clinical context, although noted the non-inferiority reported according to the FeDeriCa definitions and endpoints. The Committee considered the evidence to be broadly relevant to the New Zealand population with eBC, although the trials did not include New Zealand participants.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>On balance, the Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume non-inferiority of IV and SC for metastatic disease, however, considered that the benefit from pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC over standard of care treatment with IV trastuzumab and chemotherapy for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of eBC was unclear from the evidence provided. The Committee therefore considered that it should defer the application for adjuvant treatment until publication of the APHINITY final OS analysis in 2024 and should defer its consideration of the neoadjuvant indication pending CTAC’s assessment of the additional data provided for pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.</p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that any time savings from SC treatment duration compared with that of IV administration would be small and not likely meaningful in the context of current healthcare constraints (ie unlikely to free up resources such as beds and staff time by switching from IV to SC). The Committee noted that some treatments that could feasibly be given in primary care are currently given in secondary care to address delivery needs where there is no package of care available for implementation nor capitated funding. The Committee considered that there would be a resource impact even if SC treatment were able to be given in the community, likely conveying an opportunity cost on general practice. The Committee noted that it was not a safety issue preventing primary care administration of infusions, rather increased capacity would be required as the same infusion services would deliver either SC or IV treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was the potential for a proactive community treatment plan in future in collaboration with Te Whatu Ora, linking to the overall health strategy and including provincial centres for access to a range of treatments (eg inflammatory diseases). Members considered that such a transition to primary care (not necessarily general practice) would offer benefits by enabling access for those living in remote or rural areas, although acknowledged these may not be quantifiable time savings for Pharmac cost-effectiveness assessment.</p><h2><strong>Costs and Savings</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC for mBC, even if cost-neutral, may incur a cost to the healthcare system and a cost to individuals in the community for treatment administration. The Committee noted the competition for supply of IV trastuzumab (with a competitive process currently underway), and therefore considered it was reasonable, at this point in time, to require cost neutrality to the originator pertuzumab and generic trastuzumab. The Committee considered competition for pertuzumab would also be anticipated following patent expiry for this agent, although the Committee noted there were still active patents in New Zealand for the innovator IV pertuzumab. The Committee noted that this proposal would be the originator combination product.</p><h2><strong>Summary for Assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.19.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC at this time, for treatment of HER-2 positive metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer.

The Committee considered that the evidence from APHINITY and evidence of non-inferiority between SC and IV in FeDeriCa were most relevant but lacked rigor in their trial designs. The Committee considered there was some uncertainty in whether there would be non-inferiority in a clinical context, although noted the non-inferiority reported according to the FeDeriCa definitions and endpoints. The Committee considered the evidence to be broadly relevant to the New Zealand population with eBC, although the trials did not include New Zealand participants.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>On balance, the Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume non-inferiority of IV and SC for metastatic disease, however, considered that the benefit from pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC over standard of care treatment with IV trastuzumab and chemotherapy for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of eBC was unclear from the evidence provided. The Committee therefore considered that it should defer the application for adjuvant treatment until publication of the APHINITY final OS analysis in 2024 and should defer its consideration of the neoadjuvant indication pending CTAC’s assessment of the additional data provided for pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.</p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that any time savings from SC treatment duration compared with that of IV administration would be small and not likely meaningful in the context of current healthcare constraints (ie unlikely to free up resources such as beds and staff time by switching from IV to SC). The Committee noted that some treatments that could feasibly be given in primary care are currently given in secondary care to address delivery needs where there is no package of care available for implementation nor capitated funding. The Committee considered that there would be a resource impact even if SC treatment were able to be given in the community, likely conveying an opportunity cost on general practice. The Committee noted that it was not a safety issue preventing primary care administration of infusions, rather increased capacity would be required as the same infusion services would deliver either SC or IV treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was the potential for a proactive community treatment plan in future in collaboration with Te Whatu Ora, linking to the overall health strategy and including provincial centres for access to a range of treatments (eg inflammatory diseases). Members considered that such a transition to primary care (not necessarily general practice) would offer benefits by enabling access for those living in remote or rural areas, although acknowledged these may not be quantifiable time savings for Pharmac cost-effectiveness assessment.</p><h2><strong>Costs and Savings</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC for mBC, even if cost-neutral, may incur a cost to the healthcare system and a cost to individuals in the community for treatment administration. The Committee noted the competition for supply of IV trastuzumab (with a competitive process currently underway), and therefore considered it was reasonable, at this point in time, to require cost neutrality to the originator pertuzumab and generic trastuzumab. The Committee considered competition for pertuzumab would also be anticipated following patent expiry for this agent, although the Committee noted there were still active patents in New Zealand for the innovator IV pertuzumab.
