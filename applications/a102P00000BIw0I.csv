The Committee noted that migraine can severely impact a person’s quality of life, ability to care for themselves and their family, work and productivity, as well as having an emotional and social impact. The Committee noted that migraine is considered one of the most common global causes of disease-related disability, and considered that the health utility range (0.466) used by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a> was reasonable for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that activation of the trigeminal nerve is implicated in migraine, as it releases the pro-inflammatory calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is found at increased levels in people with migraine. The Committee noted that migraine is defined as either episodic, with headache occurring on less than 15 days per month, or chronic, where there are at least 15 headache days per month of which at least 8 have migraine features. The Committee noted that there are overlapping symptoms between chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, analgesic overuse headache, stress headache, and chronic headache that may make the diagnosis of migraine difficult. The Committee noted that people with chronic headache may require a holistic, psychosocial approach from pain services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of chronic migraine has been reported to be between 1.4% and 2.2%, although approximately 8.1% of the adult population in Australia is diagnosed with migraine (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01941.x?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">Natoli et al. Cephalalgia. 2010;30:599-609</a>). The Committee noted that migraine prevalence (including tension-type headache) in New Zealand was reported to be about 17% of the 2016 population by a systematic analysis of migraine and tension-type headache for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30353868/"" target=""_blank"">GBD 2016 Headache Collaborators. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17:954-976</a>), however this overestimated the size of the migraine population by including tension-type headache. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to estimate migraine prevalence of 1.8% in New Zealand, noting that there is poor data for the prevalence of migraine in New Zealand and to inform whether there is any difference in prevalence between Māori, Pacific peoples or non-Māori and non-Pacific populations.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that most people with migraine are managed in primary care (some access treatment via private secondary specialists) and that a range of funded treatments are available for migraine. The Committee noted that propranolol, amitriptyline and topiramate may be used for either episodic or chronic migraine; pizotifen and sodium valproate may be used for episodic migraine; and botulinum toxin injections may be used for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that despite referral, access to neurology specialists, particularly for people with migraines in the public health system is currently limited due to high demand for neurology services and that it may be even more difficult for patients living at a distance from secondary care e.g. in rural locations. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections for migraine would be administered within neurology services and considered that botulinum toxin is not currently an accessible treatment option for most people with migraine who are treated in the public sector. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections are used in private care, resulting in access inequities for those who are not able to access private treatment. The Committee therefore considered that botulinum toxin was not an appropriate comparator to erenumab in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that patients who have tried at least three prophylactic anti-migraine medicines but still experience migraines have an unmet health need. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume approximately 28% of patients with migraine take migraine prophylaxis (based on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381065/"" target=""_blank"">Bloudek et al.J Headache Pain. 2012;13:361-78</a>) and that 9% would have trialled at least three funded therapies but found these to be ineffective (based on the <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">NICE Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a>). The Committee considered that many patients with migraine also experience medicines overuse, either using analgesics for more than 15 days per month or opioids (which is known to occur internationally) or triptans for more than 10 days per month.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that erenumab is a human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that reversibly binds to the CGRP receptor, modifying the trigeminal nerve signalling. Members noted that erenumab is thought to prevent migraine (which occurs within the blood-brain barrier) via CGRP blockade, although erenumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The Committee noted that erenumab is a medicine that has not previously been considered by Pharmac for any indication. The Committee noted that Medsafe has approved erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg for prophylaxis of migraine in adults, administered subcutaneously every four weeks. The Committee noted that erenumab is presented as 70 mg vials and that a dose of 140 mg requires two injections.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from Liberty; a randomised (1:1), phase IIIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 246 adult patients with episodic migraine experiencing 4-14 migraine days per month (mean 9.3 at baseline) for the past three months, treated unsuccessfully with 2-4 migraine treatments, who received either erenumab 140 mg or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(18)32534-0"" target=""_blank"">Reuter et al. Lancet. 2018;392:2280-7</a>). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of Liberty was the proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days during weeks 9-12, and that at week 12, this was reported in 30% of those taking erenumab compared with 14% of those taking placebo (odds ratio 2.7; 95% CI 0.4 to 5.2; <i>P</i>=0.002).</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from Study 295; a randomised (3:2:2), phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of 667 adults aged 18 to 65 years with chronic migraine (defined as 15 or more headache days per month, of which eight or more were migraine days) who received either erenumab 70 mg, erenumab 140 mg or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks for 12 weeks (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(17)30083-2"" target=""_blank"">Tepper et al. Lancet Neurol. 2017;16:425-34</a>).\xa0The Committee noted that Study 295 participants had a mean of about 18 migraine days (and 20 headache days) per month at baseline. The Committee noted that the study excluded those who had trialled more than three medications for prophylactic treatment of migraine and considered that the trial population was not the exact group considered to have a health need for a new agent such as erenumab in New Zealand. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of Study 295 was the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last four weeks of double-blind treatment (weeks 9−12), which was reported to be −6.6 days with both erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg vs −4.2 days with placebo; a difference of −2.5, (95% CI −3.5 to −1.4, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). Members considered this active difference was a small reduction in the context of severe migraines. The Committee noted that anti-erenumab antibodies were reported in 11 patients in the 70 mg group and three in the 140 mg group in Study 295, none of which were neutralising.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0 </span>The Committee noted further evidence from Liberty including a three-year open-label extension (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33910942/"" target=""_blank"">Goadsby et al.

Members considered that the placebo responses were not unexpected in this population with pain from chronic migraine. The Committee considered that the evidence from Study 295, in particular, suggested there is a proportional dose response curve for erenumab and that while it provides some short-term benefit at both the 70 mg and 140 mg doses with similar efficacy and toxicities, the 140 mg dose provides better duration of effect and long-term outcomes than the 70 mg dose.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence from a non-interventional, retrospective, exploratory, claims database analysis of treatment effectiveness (<a href=""https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2021.21060?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">Tepper et al. J Manag Care Spec Pharm. 2021;27:1157-70).</a> Members considered that this provided poor quality data of fewer claims on average for acute migraine treatments in patients who received erenumab compared with patients who received botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted there was no difference in claims for acute migraine treatments when compared with patients who received triptans or barbiturates.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there was no head-to-head, randomised controlled trial evidence for erenumab compared with botulinum toxin, other anti-migraine therapies or other monoclonal antibodies. The Committee noted that the clinical trial data did not provide outcomes beyond 52 weeks, whereas chronic migraine would usually continue beyond one year. The Committee considered that the evidence was of moderate strength and quality, noting that one trial (Study 295) did not include the target population.

The Committee noted that migraine can severely impact a person’s quality of life, ability to care for themselves and their family, work and productivity, as well as having an emotional and social impact. The Committee noted that migraine is considered one of the most common global causes of disease-related disability, and considered that the health utility range (0.466) used by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a> was reasonable for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that activation of the trigeminal nerve is implicated in migraine, as it releases the pro-inflammatory calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is found at increased levels in people with migraine. The Committee noted that migraine is defined as either episodic, with headache occurring on less than 15 days per month, or chronic, where there are at least 15 headache days per month of which at least 8 have migraine features. The Committee noted that there are overlapping symptoms between chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, analgesic overuse headache, stress headache, and chronic headache that may make the diagnosis of migraine difficult. The Committee noted that people with chronic headache may require a holistic, psychosocial approach from pain services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of chronic migraine has been reported to be between 1.4% and 2.2%, although approximately 8.1% of the adult population in Australia is diagnosed with migraine (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01941.x?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">Natoli et al. Cephalalgia. 2010;30:599-609</a>). The Committee noted that migraine prevalence (including tension-type headache) in New Zealand was reported to be about 17% of the 2016 population by a systematic analysis of migraine and tension-type headache for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30353868/"" target=""_blank"">GBD 2016 Headache Collaborators. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17:954-976</a>), however this overestimated the size of the migraine population by including tension-type headache. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to estimate migraine prevalence of 1.8% in New Zealand, noting that there is poor data for the prevalence of migraine in New Zealand and to inform whether there is any difference in prevalence between Māori, Pacific peoples or non-Māori and non-Pacific populations.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that most people with migraine are managed in primary care (some access treatment via private secondary specialists) and that a range of funded treatments are available for migraine. The Committee noted that propranolol, amitriptyline and topiramate may be used for either episodic or chronic migraine; pizotifen and sodium valproate may be used for episodic migraine; and botulinum toxin injections may be used for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that despite referral, access to neurology specialists, particularly for people with migraines in the public health system is currently limited due to high demand for neurology services and that it may be even more difficult for patients living at a distance from secondary care e.g. in rural locations. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections for migraine would be administered within neurology services and considered that botulinum toxin is not currently an accessible treatment option for most people with migraine who are treated in the public sector. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections are used in private care, resulting in access inequities for those who are not able to access private treatment. The Committee therefore considered that botulinum toxin was not an appropriate comparator to erenumab in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that patients who have tried at least three prophylactic anti-migraine medicines but still experience migraines have an unmet health need. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume approximately 28% of patients with migraine take migraine prophylaxis (based on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381065/"" target=""_blank"">Bloudek et al.J Headache Pain. 2012;13:361-78</a>) and that 9% would have trialled at least three funded therapies but found these to be ineffective (based on the <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">NICE Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a>).

Members noted that erenumab is thought to prevent migraine (which occurs within the blood-brain barrier) via CGRP blockade, although erenumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The Committee noted that erenumab is a medicine that has not previously been considered by Pharmac for any indication. The Committee noted that Medsafe has approved erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg for prophylaxis of migraine in adults, administered subcutaneously every four weeks. The Committee noted that erenumab is presented as 70 mg vials and that a dose of 140 mg requires two injections.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from Liberty; a randomised (1:1), phase IIIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 246 adult patients with episodic migraine experiencing 4-14 migraine days per month (mean 9.3 at baseline) for the past three months, treated unsuccessfully with 2-4 migraine treatments, who received either erenumab 140 mg or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(18)32534-0"" target=""_blank"">Reuter et al.

The Committee noted that the study excluded those who had trialled more than three medications for prophylactic treatment of migraine and considered that the trial population was not the exact group considered to have a health need for a new agent such as erenumab in New Zealand. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of Study 295 was the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last four weeks of double-blind treatment (weeks 9−12), which was reported to be −6.6 days with both erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg vs −4.2 days with placebo; a difference of −2.5, (95% CI −3.5 to −1.4, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). Members considered this active difference was a small reduction in the context of severe migraines. The Committee noted that anti-erenumab antibodies were reported in 11 patients in the 70 mg group and three in the 140 mg group in Study 295, none of which were neutralising.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0 </span>The Committee noted further evidence from Liberty including a three-year open-label extension (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33910942/"" target=""_blank"">Goadsby et al.

The Committee noted that migraine can severely impact a person’s quality of life, ability to care for themselves and their family, work and productivity, as well as having an emotional and social impact. The Committee noted that migraine is considered one of the most common global causes of disease-related disability, and considered that the health utility range (0.466) used by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a> was reasonable for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that activation of the trigeminal nerve is implicated in migraine, as it releases the pro-inflammatory calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is found at increased levels in people with migraine. The Committee noted that migraine is defined as either episodic, with headache occurring on less than 15 days per month, or chronic, where there are at least 15 headache days per month of which at least 8 have migraine features. The Committee noted that there are overlapping symptoms between chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, analgesic overuse headache, stress headache, and chronic headache that may make the diagnosis of migraine difficult. The Committee noted that people with chronic headache may require a holistic, psychosocial approach from pain services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of chronic migraine has been reported to be between 1.4% and 2.2%, although approximately 8.1% of the adult population in Australia is diagnosed with migraine (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01941.x?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">Natoli et al. Cephalalgia. 2010;30:599-609</a>). The Committee noted that migraine prevalence (including tension-type headache) in New Zealand was reported to be about 17% of the 2016 population by a systematic analysis of migraine and tension-type headache for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30353868/"" target=""_blank"">GBD 2016 Headache Collaborators. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17:954-976</a>), however this overestimated the size of the migraine population by including tension-type headache. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to estimate migraine prevalence of 1.8% in New Zealand, noting that there is poor data for the prevalence of migraine in New Zealand and to inform whether there is any difference in prevalence between Māori, Pacific peoples or non-Māori and non-Pacific populations.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that most people with migraine are managed in primary care (some access treatment via private secondary specialists) and that a range of funded treatments are available for migraine. The Committee noted that propranolol, amitriptyline and topiramate may be used for either episodic or chronic migraine; pizotifen and sodium valproate may be used for episodic migraine; and botulinum toxin injections may be used for chronic migraine.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that despite referral, access to neurology specialists, particularly for people with migraines in the public health system is currently limited due to high demand for neurology services and that it may be even more difficult for patients living at a distance from secondary care e.g. in rural locations. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections for migraine would be administered within neurology services and considered that botulinum toxin is not currently an accessible treatment option for most people with migraine who are treated in the public sector. The Committee noted that botulinum toxin injections are used in private care, resulting in access inequities for those who are not able to access private treatment. The Committee therefore considered that botulinum toxin was not an appropriate comparator to erenumab in New Zealand.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that patients who have tried at least three prophylactic anti-migraine medicines but still experience migraines have an unmet health need. The Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume approximately 28% of patients with migraine take migraine prophylaxis (based on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381065/"" target=""_blank"">Bloudek et al.J Headache Pain. 2012;13:361-78</a>) and that 9% would have trialled at least three funded therapies but found these to be ineffective (based on the <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta682/resources/erenumab-for-preventing-migraine-pdf-82609376694469"" target=""_blank"">NICE Technology appraisal guidance TA682</a>). The Committee considered that many patients with migraine also experience medicines overuse, either using analgesics for more than 15 days per month or opioids (which is known to occur internationally) or triptans for more than 10 days per month.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that erenumab is a human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that reversibly binds to the CGRP receptor, modifying the trigeminal nerve signalling. Members noted that erenumab is thought to prevent migraine (which occurs within the blood-brain barrier) via CGRP blockade, although erenumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The Committee noted that erenumab is a medicine that has not previously been considered by Pharmac for any indication. The Committee noted that Medsafe has approved erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg for prophylaxis of migraine in adults, administered subcutaneously every four weeks. The Committee noted that erenumab is presented as 70 mg vials and that a dose of 140 mg requires two injections.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from Liberty; a randomised (1:1), phase IIIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 246 adult patients with episodic migraine experiencing 4-14 migraine days per month (mean 9.3 at baseline) for the past three months, treated unsuccessfully with 2-4 migraine treatments, who received either erenumab 140 mg or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(18)32534-0"" target=""_blank"">Reuter et al. Lancet. 2018;392:2280-7</a>). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of Liberty was the proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days during weeks 9-12, and that at week 12, this was reported in 30% of those taking erenumab compared with 14% of those taking placebo (odds ratio 2.7; 95% CI 0.4 to 5.2; <i>P</i>=0.002).</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted evidence from Study 295; a randomised (3:2:2), phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of 667 adults aged 18 to 65 years with chronic migraine (defined as 15 or more headache days per month, of which eight or more were migraine days) who received either erenumab 70 mg, erenumab 140 mg or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks for 12 weeks (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(17)30083-2"" target=""_blank"">Tepper et al. Lancet Neurol. 2017;16:425-34</a>).\xa0The Committee noted that Study 295 participants had a mean of about 18 migraine days (and 20 headache days) per month at baseline. The Committee noted that the study excluded those who had trialled more than three medications for prophylactic treatment of migraine and considered that the trial population was not the exact group considered to have a health need for a new agent such as erenumab in New Zealand. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of Study 295 was the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last four weeks of double-blind treatment (weeks 9−12), which was reported to be −6.6 days with both erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg vs −4.2 days with placebo; a difference of −2.5, (95% CI −3.5 to −1.4, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). Members considered this active difference was a small reduction in the context of severe migraines. The Committee noted that anti-erenumab antibodies were reported in 11 patients in the 70 mg group and three in the 140 mg group in Study 295, none of which were neutralising.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0 </span>The Committee noted further evidence from Liberty including a three-year open-label extension (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33910942/"" target=""_blank"">Goadsby et al.

Members considered that the placebo responses were not unexpected in this population with pain from chronic migraine. The Committee considered that the evidence from Study 295, in particular, suggested there is a proportional dose response curve for erenumab and that while it provides some short-term benefit at both the 70 mg and 140 mg doses with similar efficacy and toxicities, the 140 mg dose provides better duration of effect and long-term outcomes than the 70 mg dose.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence from a non-interventional, retrospective, exploratory, claims database analysis of treatment effectiveness (<a href=""https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2021.21060?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"">Tepper et al.

However, the Committee noted there was no difference in claims for acute migraine treatments when compared with patients who received triptans or barbiturates.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there was no head-to-head, randomised controlled trial evidence for erenumab compared with botulinum toxin, other anti-migraine therapies or other monoclonal antibodies. The Committee noted that the clinical trial data did not provide outcomes beyond 52 weeks, whereas chronic migraine would usually continue beyond one year. The Committee considered that the evidence was of moderate strength and quality, noting that one trial (Study 295) did not include the target population. The Committee noted that there was no clinical trial data for the use of erenumab in New Zealand patients but considered there was no reason to assume any difference in benefits or risks would be seen in the New Zealand population.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upper respiratory tract infections were common adverse events associated with erenumab, however, the Committee considered that the safety profile of erenumab overall was less serious than that reported for other monoclonal antibodies that target immune pathways. The Committee noted that post-marketing data reported the incidence of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and hypertension which were events of concern. The Committee noted that the anti-drug antibodies reported with erenumab were transient and non-neutralising.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0 </span>The Committee considered that the most appropriate use of erenumab would be for patients with episodic or chronic migraine who have trialled three prophylactic agents previously, although this would require a careful diagnosis given the possibility of differential diagnoses. The Committee considered that, patients with chronic migraine would have a greater health need and may receive greater benefit from funded access to erenumab compared with episodic migraine.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that patients seeking funded access to erenumab would likely be receiving prophylactic migraine therapy (even if ineffective) which erenumab would replace, and that these patients may use analgesics for breakthrough migraines while on erenumab. The Committee considered that erenumab would be used at a dose of 140 mg in most cases, with patients either starting treatment at this dose or increasing to this dose over time. The Committee considered that erenumab would be used indefinitely unless a patient experienced intolerable adverse events, although members noted that migraine can decrease with age in which case erenumab might be used for approximately 5 to 10 years.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0 </span>The Committee considered that, as erenumab is an expensive medicine, it would be reasonable for Pharmac to utilise restrictive funding criteria to target access for erenumab. The Committee considered that an improvement in migraine days of at least 50% compared with baseline was consistent with the clinical trial endpoints and would be appropriate for the purposes of funded treatment renewal, as opposed to a minimal clinically important difference of 30% used by some international jurisdictions.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if erenumab were funded for migraine, there would be significant issues around its prescribing and management across primary and secondary care.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.18.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee again noted that access to neurologists in the public health system is currently limited. The Committee considered that a requirement for referral to neurology services for funded access to erenumab e.g. if prescribed by, or on the advice of, a neurologist; would present a barrier to accessing treatment. The Committee considered that the volume of new referrals for migraine, if accepted, would significantly affect neurology services, including their capacity to treat patients with other neurological conditions requiring specialist care.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.18.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that from a primary care perspective that, regardless of the level of secondary care support, the effects of having to manage a monoclonal antibody like erenumab could affect that sector’s capacity to treat patients with other conditions. Such pressures would be worse if GPs had little specialist secondary care support when starting and maintaining treatment with erenumab, as with any monoclonal antibody. Members considered some GPs would be uncomfortable initiating a patient on erenumab, due to the challenges of accurately diagnosing this specific patient group e.g. the potential overlap with tension-type headache and chronic pain. Members considered that GPs have variable experience and comfort in managing treatment with monoclonal antibodies in practice generally, with many being unfamiliar with these medicines and inexperienced in managing their associated risks.\xa0</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the costs and logistics of erenumab treatment, such as syringe disposal, training for subcutaneous administration, and nursing support were unclear. The Committee considered that syringe disposal by pharmacies or GP clinics may not be feasible therefore disposal requirements and costs, in the absence of a supplier-led disposal programme, may fall on secondary care.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered it was uncertain whether any public health sector savings would result from funding erenumab for migraine e.g. due to a reduction in emergency department presentations or hospitalisations.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding erenumab has the potential to increase the existing inequity of access to this treatment, as it would be easier to access for those who could already obtain it privately while the significant issues around its prescribing and management across primary and secondary care could lead to inequitable access in the public system.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for erenumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><table class=""ql-table-blob"" border=""0"" style=""width: 460.45pt; text-align: center;"" width=""614""><tbody><tr style=""height: 22.1pt;""><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"" valign=""top"" style=""width: 75.3pt;
