<p>In November 2021, we introduced separate terms of reference for the SACs to make clear that these committees have different, but complementary, roles, expertise and perspectives to PTAC.</p>

<p>PTAC and SACs may make recommendations to Pharmac that differ from each other when looking at the same evidence. Pharmac considers the recommendations provided by all our clinical advisory committees when assessing applications.</p>

However, the Committee considered that it also follows that if a person being treated with csDMARD(s) experiences a partial treatment response, they might not then meet the criteria for biologic treatment. The Committee however considered that biologic treatment would be both clinically appropriate in people with a partial response to csDMARDs and would in addition reduce the potential for adverse effects from continuing csDMARDs.</p><p><br></p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there to be few appropriate csDMARD options for pregnant people, with leflunomide and methotrexate being contraindicated in pregnancy.

The Committee considered that the use of leflunomide in those of childbearing potential as a second line csDMARD could affect the time for them to have children with potential flare with withdrawal and wash out.</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a13OZ000001RiShYAK'}, 'change': None}]",Mar 2023,False,True
