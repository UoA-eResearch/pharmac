The Committee was made aware of evidence that mortality rates for individuals with PWS had decreased over time and considered that these decreases could be attributed to earlier detection and treatment of the condition, the increasing proportion of patients who are managed by multi-disciplinary care teams, an increased focus on weight management and diet, and access to growth hormone therapy for children with the condition.

The Committee considered that the patients included provided strong numbers for this rare condition and noted that the median age was 26.2 months with median follow-up of two years. The Committee noted that the authors reported a benefit on body composition, fat mass and muscle mass; some improvements in cardiovascular function in a limited number of studies; a variable impact on lipids; and no significant improvement in bone mineral density (although noting the data was short-term). The Committee considered that there was evidence from adolescent follow-up and cross-over studies that body composition worsens on cessation of growth hormone therapy.

The Committee noted that participants in the latter study with a lower IQ at the start of the study lost more cognitive function during the year on placebo than in the year on growth hormone than those with a higher IQ at study start although IQ deterioration during placebo treatment was not significant overall, and that body composition deteriorated significantly while on placebo. The Committee considered this evidence used validated measures and suggested an impact of growth hormone on cognitive function.

The Committee considered there was insufficient evidence of a difference in benefits or risks associated with growth hormone treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk or all-cause mortality, but that there was possibly a benefit in terms of cognitive function. On balance, the Committee considered that the evidence supported funding for somatropin use in adolescents and adults with the key outcome being improved body composition.

The Committee considered that the estimated health-related quality of life impacts of PWS used in the 2006 analysis were not applicable to the adult PWS patient population but noted that the impacts of the condition spanned many domains of health-related quality of life and were generally of a moderate severity.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted an estimate of the eligible population, if access to somatropin was widened for adults with PWS, of between 60 and 70 adult patients per year but considered this was likely an overestimate due to the high mortality rates associated with PWS.

The Committee considered there was insufficient evidence of a difference in benefits or risks associated with growth hormone treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk or all-cause mortality, but that there was possibly a benefit in terms of cognitive function. On balance, the Committee considered that the evidence supported funding for somatropin use in adolescents and adults with the key outcome being improved body composition.

The Committee considered that the estimated health-related quality of life impacts of PWS used in the 2006 analysis were not applicable to the adult PWS patient population but noted that the impacts of the condition spanned many domains of health-related quality of life and were generally of a moderate severity.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted an estimate of the eligible population, if access to somatropin was widened for adults with PWS, of between 60 and 70 adult patients per year but considered this was likely an overestimate due to the high mortality rates associated with PWS.

J Intellect Disabil Res. 2005;49:245-52</a>), and that reported no difference in change in total, verbal or performance IQ during a year on growth hormone compared with a year on placebo in a two-year crossover study of 25 adults who had growth hormone therapy in childhood (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27852283/"" target=""_blank"">Kuppens et al. 2016. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2016;11:153</a>). The Committee noted that participants in the latter study with a lower IQ at the start of the study lost more cognitive function during the year on placebo than in the year on growth hormone than those with a higher IQ at study start although IQ deterioration during placebo treatment was not significant overall, and that body composition deteriorated significantly while on placebo. The Committee considered this evidence used validated measures and suggested an impact of growth hormone on cognitive function. Members considered that changes in IQ in the range of 15 points would be meaningful for patients and caregivers (eg from being intellectually disabled and requiring residential care to being within the normal IQ range and living at home).</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members were made aware of a one-year cohort study involving sequential MRI scans that reported an improvement in lean body mass, reduction in fat mass, improvement in overall balance and functional activity with growth hormone.

The Committee considered there was insufficient evidence of a difference in benefits or risks associated with growth hormone treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk or all-cause mortality, but that there was possibly a benefit in terms of cognitive function. On balance, the Committee considered that the evidence supported funding for somatropin use in adolescents and adults with the key outcome being improved body composition.

The Committee considered that the estimated health-related quality of life impacts of PWS used in the 2006 analysis were not applicable to the adult PWS patient population but noted that the impacts of the condition spanned many domains of health-related quality of life and were generally of a moderate severity.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted an estimate of the eligible population, if access to somatropin was widened for adults with PWS, of between 60 and 70 adult patients per year but considered this was likely an overestimate due to the high mortality rates associated with PWS. The Committee considered that given the small population, the cost of widening access to somatropin in this population may be low.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most patients would remain on somatropin treatment long-term, owing to the sustained treatment benefits observed and the favourable side effect profile. The Committee noted that discontinuations of treatment due to malignancies and other complications are uncommon.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for somatropin if access were to be widened in New Zealand for adults and adolescents with PWS.

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
