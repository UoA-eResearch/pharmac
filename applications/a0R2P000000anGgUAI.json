The Subcommittee noted that the crystals themselves have minimal impact on visual acuity, but that secondary effects can include photophobia, blepharospasm, pain, foreign body sensation, punctate keratopathy, filamentary keratopathy, peripheral corneal neovascularisation, and recurrent corneal erosions.</p><p>1.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the primary treatment for cystinosis is systemic cysteamine, which preserves renal function and prevents many of the other sequelae associated with cystinosis but does not reduce the accumulation of cystine crystals in the cornea. The Subcommittee noted that topical treatment with eye drops is therefore required in addition to systemic cysteamine to manage the progressive ophthalmologic involvement.</p><p>1.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are currently five children and five adults diagnosed with cystinosis in New Zealand, and that the incidence is estimated to be less than one in every 100,000 live births. The Subcommittee considered that there may be one new patient diagnosed with cystinosis every two to three years. The Subcommittee noted that cystinosis is considered to be a pan-ethnic condition. </p><p>1.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Cystadrops is not currently approved by Medsafe, but that the product has regulatory approval in the European Union for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children from 2 years of age with cystinosis.

The Subcommittee considered that the recommended administration of this product is one drop in each eye at least four to five times daily.</p><p>1.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cysteamine eye drops reduce corneal cystine crystal accumulation by acting as a cysteine-depleting agent by converting cystine to cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides.</p><p>1.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of patients with cystinosis in New Zealand are currently receiving funding for aqueous cysteamine eye drops through the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) mechanism.</p><p>1.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the findings of a Phase 1/2a, open label, crossover, dose response trial that investigated the safety and efficacy of Cystadrops (viscous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.55%) compared with aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops for the treatment of corneal complications in eight patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440466\" target=\"_blank\">Labb\u00e9 et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2014;111:314-320</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops four times daily for one month and then switched to Cystadrops at the same dose frequency for 48 months. The Subcommittee noted that after switching to Cystadrops, the in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) score decreased by a mean of 28.6% at Day 90 (P&lt;0.0001), a difference which was maintained over 48 months of treatment with Cystadrops. The Subcommittee considered that this likely represented some improvement in visual symptoms but were unsure of the clinical relevance of IVCM as a measure of efficacy. The Subcommittee noted that no serious adverse events were observed during the study. </p><p>1.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the findings of an open-label, randomised, two-armed, Phase 3 trial that investigated the efficacy of Cystadrops (viscous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.55%) compared with aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops administered four times daily for 90 days in 31 patients with cystinosis (Liang et al. Invest Opthalmol Vis Sci. 2017;58:2275-83). The Subcommittee noted that the mean absolute change in IVCM at Day 90 was -4.6 (\u00b13.1) in the group receiving Cystadrops compared with -0.46 (\u00b13.38) in the group receiving aqueous eye drops (P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that photophobia, corneal cysteine crystal scores, and corneal cystine crystal depth were significantly improved in the group receiving Cystadrops compared with the group receiving aqueous cysteamine eye drops. The Subcommittee noted that four serious adverse events were reported, but none were considered related to treatment. The Subcommittee considered that 90 days was a short follow-up period for a chronic condition that likely requires life-long treatment.</p><p>1.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the two studies described above provide the primary evidence for the benefits associated with Cystadrops. However, the Subcommittee considered that the use of products with different concentrations of cysteamine hydrochloride (0.55% viscous vs 0.1% aqueous) limits the value of these studies, as any improvement in outcome is likely to be due to a higher concentration of the active ingredient as opposed to the formulation of the product. The Subcommittee noted the supplier\u2019s explanation that the 0.1% aqueous product was the standard of care at the time in the country where the studies were performed, but also noted that the 0.1% aqueous product has since been removed from the market due to its failure to show efficacy in treating corneal cystine crystals.</p><p>1.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be benefits associated with having an eye drop product that required fewer instillations per day (ideally once daily), particularly for young children where administration is difficult; however, it was not clear to the Subcommittee whether the use of Cystadrops would enable a meaningful reduction in the number of daily installations required given that real-world practice indicates that the aqueous product is often only administered four times daily. </p><p>1.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Cystadrops does not require refrigeration, which may have benefits compared with the aqueous formulation, but also noted that the shelf-life (once opened) of Cystadrops is only 7 days compared with 28 days for the aqueous formulation if properly stored.</p><p>1.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed price for Cystadrops was approximately 18-fold higher than the cost of the aqueous eye drop product currently used in New Zealand, which is a significant incremental difference for uncertain benefits. </p><p>1.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the currently available evidence for Cystadrops is of low quality due to the comparator in the pivotal trials having a significantly lower concentration of cysteamine hydrochloride than both Cystadrops and the currently funded alternative. The Subcommittee considered there was a theoretical suitability benefit associated with the use of a viscous formulation, but that this benefit did not outweigh the significant cost of Cystadrops.</p><p>1.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that any further consideration of the proposal would need to include both additional evidence demonstrating that Cystadrops requires fewer daily instillations with equivalent or superior efficacy to the currently available aqueous formulation, and a revised price with cost-effectiveness comparable to that of the aqueous formulation.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that the crystals themselves have minimal impact on visual acuity, but that secondary effects can include photophobia, blepharospasm, pain, foreign body sensation, punctate keratopathy, filamentary keratopathy, peripheral corneal neovascularisation, and recurrent corneal erosions.</p><p>1.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the primary treatment for cystinosis is systemic cysteamine, which preserves renal function and prevents many of the other sequelae associated with cystinosis but does not reduce the accumulation of cystine crystals in the cornea. The Subcommittee noted that topical treatment with eye drops is therefore required in addition to systemic cysteamine to manage the progressive ophthalmologic involvement.</p><p>1.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are currently five children and five adults diagnosed with cystinosis in New Zealand, and that the incidence is estimated to be less than one in every 100,000 live births. The Subcommittee considered that there may be one new patient diagnosed with cystinosis every two to three years. The Subcommittee noted that cystinosis is considered to be a pan-ethnic condition. </p><p>1.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Cystadrops is not currently approved by Medsafe, but that the product has regulatory approval in the European Union for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children from 2 years of age with cystinosis. The Subcommittee noted that Cystadrops is not approved for any indication other than cystinosis.</p><p>1.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding application for Cystadrops met PHARMAC\u2019s principles for rare disorders.</p><p>1.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current standard of care for the treatment of corneal cystine crystals in New Zealand is an unfunded, unlicensed, preservative-free aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.55% eye drop product that is compounded by Optimus Healthcare Limited. The Subcommittee considered that the recommended administration of this product is one drop in each eye at least four to five times daily.</p><p>1.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that cysteamine eye drops reduce corneal cystine crystal accumulation by acting as a cysteine-depleting agent by converting cystine to cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides.</p><p>1.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that a number of patients with cystinosis in New Zealand are currently receiving funding for aqueous cysteamine eye drops through the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) mechanism.</p><p>1.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the findings of a Phase 1/2a, open label, crossover, dose response trial that investigated the safety and efficacy of Cystadrops (viscous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.55%) compared with aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops for the treatment of corneal complications in eight patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440466\" target=\"_blank\">Labb\u00e9 et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2014;111:314-320</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops four times daily for one month and then switched to Cystadrops at the same dose frequency for 48 months. The Subcommittee noted that after switching to Cystadrops, the in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) score decreased by a mean of 28.6% at Day 90 (P&lt;0.0001), a difference which was maintained over 48 months of treatment with Cystadrops. The Subcommittee considered that this likely represented some improvement in visual symptoms but were unsure of the clinical relevance of IVCM as a measure of efficacy. The Subcommittee noted that no serious adverse events were observed during the study. </p><p>1.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the findings of an open-label, randomised, two-armed, Phase 3 trial that investigated the efficacy of Cystadrops (viscous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.55%) compared with aqueous cysteamine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops administered four times daily for 90 days in 31 patients with cystinosis (Liang et al. Invest Opthalmol Vis Sci. 2017;58:2275-83). The Subcommittee noted that the mean absolute change in IVCM at Day 90 was -4.6 (\u00b13.1) in the group receiving Cystadrops compared with -0.46 (\u00b13.38) in the group receiving aqueous eye drops (P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee noted that photophobia, corneal cysteine crystal scores, and corneal cystine crystal depth were significantly improved in the group receiving Cystadrops compared with the group receiving aqueous cysteamine eye drops. The Subcommittee noted that four serious adverse events were reported, but none were considered related to treatment. The Subcommittee considered that 90 days was a short follow-up period for a chronic condition that likely requires life-long treatment.</p><p>1.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the two studies described above provide the primary evidence for the benefits associated with Cystadrops. However, the Subcommittee considered that the use of products with different concentrations of cysteamine hydrochloride (0.55% viscous vs 0.1% aqueous) limits the value of these studies, as any improvement in outcome is likely to be due to a higher concentration of the active ingredient as opposed to the formulation of the product. The Subcommittee noted the supplier\u2019s explanation that the 0.1% aqueous product was the standard of care at the time in the country where the studies were performed, but also noted that the 0.1% aqueous product has since been removed from the market due to its failure to show efficacy in treating corneal cystine crystals.</p><p>1.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be benefits associated with having an eye drop product that required fewer instillations per day (ideally once daily), particularly for young children where administration is difficult; however, it was not clear to the Subcommittee whether the use of Cystadrops would enable a meaningful reduction in the number of daily installations required given that real-world practice indicates that the aqueous product is often only administered four times daily. </p><p>1.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that Cystadrops does not require refrigeration, which may have benefits compared with the aqueous formulation, but also noted that the shelf-life (once opened) of Cystadrops is only 7 days compared with 28 days for the aqueous formulation if properly stored.</p><p>1.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed price for Cystadrops was approximately 18-fold higher than the cost of the aqueous eye drop product currently used in New Zealand, which is a significant incremental difference for uncertain benefits. </p><p>1.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the currently available evidence for Cystadrops is of low quality due to the comparator in the pivotal trials having a significantly lower concentration of cysteamine hydrochloride than both Cystadrops and the currently funded alternative. The Subcommittee considered there was a theoretical suitability benefit associated with the use of a viscous formulation, but that this benefit did not outweigh the significant cost of Cystadrops.</p><p>1.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that any further consideration of the proposal would need to include both additional evidence demonstrating that Cystadrops requires fewer daily instillations with equivalent or superior efficacy to the currently available aqueous formulation, and a revised price with cost-effectiveness comparable to that of the aqueous formulation.</p>",
