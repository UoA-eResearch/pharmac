The Subcommittee recommended that the application for funding of budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules for adults with EoE be declined, on the basis that adults did not appear to have the same difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there had been previous issues with supply of the budesonide respules to the New Zealand market, alongside pharmacy compounding issues for a pharmaceutical not registered or intended for use in this indication or administration method. Members previously considered that Pharmac should investigate if there is a supplier that would be willing to register a swallowed corticosteroid product in New Zealand for the EoE indication. </p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in May 2018 and recommended that that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed with a medium priority for proven EoE with dysphagia in those whose disease is not responsive to first line corticosteroids, with applications to be made by a gastroenterologist or on the recommendation of a gastroenterologist.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in making this recommendation, PTAC considered that there was sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of oral viscous budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in both children and adults and made no differentiation between the two groups, however PTAC did acknowledge the additional need of children, resulting from the difficulties with the oral use of inhaled fluticasone presentations in this population. </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Dr Falk Pharma New Zealand Limited had recently received Medsafe approval for its Jorveza brand of budesonide orally disintegrating tablets for the treatment of EoE in adults aged 18 and older. The Committee noted that Jorveza is listed on Australia’s’ Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Need</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee’s previous view regarding the significant health need of people with EoE, particularly in children, who often have difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, currently, children and adults with EoE are clinically managed in the same way, namely first-line treatment with proton pump inhibitors and, if this is not successful, a 6-food elimination diet for 8-12 weeks is usually tried for children, but the latter has limited acceptance in adolescence and adults. If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation. The Committee considered that some of this trend is likely attributable to an increasing prevalence of people with treatment refractory EoE. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee’s own views regarding the health benefit of budesonide oral viscous nebules in the treatment of EoE.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide and other swallowed topical corticosteroids reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the oesophagus and subsequently, the fibrotic remodelling of the epithelial surface. The Committee noted that it had previously considered evidence that viscous topical budesonide was more effective at coating of the oesophagus compared with the swallowed nebulised corticosteroid which tend to show some diversion into the lungs (Nennstiel S, Schlag C.

The Subcommittee recommended that the application for funding of budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules for adults with EoE be declined, on the basis that adults did not appear to have the same difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there had been previous issues with supply of the budesonide respules to the New Zealand market, alongside pharmacy compounding issues for a pharmaceutical not registered or intended for use in this indication or administration method. Members previously considered that Pharmac should investigate if there is a supplier that would be willing to register a swallowed corticosteroid product in New Zealand for the EoE indication. </p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in May 2018 and recommended that that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed with a medium priority for proven EoE with dysphagia in those whose disease is not responsive to first line corticosteroids, with applications to be made by a gastroenterologist or on the recommendation of a gastroenterologist.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in making this recommendation, PTAC considered that there was sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of oral viscous budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in both children and adults and made no differentiation between the two groups, however PTAC did acknowledge the additional need of children, resulting from the difficulties with the oral use of inhaled fluticasone presentations in this population. </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Dr Falk Pharma New Zealand Limited had recently received Medsafe approval for its Jorveza brand of budesonide orally disintegrating tablets for the treatment of EoE in adults aged 18 and older.

If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation.

The Subcommittee recommended that the application for funding of budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules for adults with EoE be declined, on the basis that adults did not appear to have the same difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there had been previous issues with supply of the budesonide respules to the New Zealand market, alongside pharmacy compounding issues for a pharmaceutical not registered or intended for use in this indication or administration method.

If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation.

In particular, the Committee considered that orodispersible tablets would provide an alternative for children or those with neuromuscular disabilities who find it difficult to coordinate the actuation of a nebuliser device with swallowing.
