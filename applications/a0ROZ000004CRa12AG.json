The Committee noted that ketamine (or its enantiomers) are not currently included in the RANZCP guidelines for treatment-resistant depression. The Committee noted that in clinical practice, often patients have not been tried on adequate doses and durations of antidepressants and in a New Zealand setting this can make it difficult to identify patients whose depression is treatment-resistant. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that relative to other countries, New Zealand has a high burden of mental health conditions. The Committee noted approximately 16% of New Zealanders experience depression in their lifetime and approximately 30% of patients with depression are reported to be treatment-resistant, equating to approximately 350,000 patients with depression and 110,000 with treatment-resistant depression in New Zealand<i>.</i> Members also noted that treatment-resistant depression is not necessarily severe depression; treatment-resistant depression can present as mild, moderate or severe. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with depression can experience symptoms such as a persistent sad, anxious or empty mood, feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia. The Committee noted that women, M\u0101ori, people living in rural areas and people with chronic physical illness and cancer are disproportionately affected by depression. The Committee noted that patients with treatment-resistant depression are not able to achieve relief from these symptoms and therefore the disease impacts this population to a great extent, resulting in a high health need and a high burden of disease. The Committee also noted that there are also significant emotional, psychiatric, existential and financial health needs for the families and wh\u0101nau of people with treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC currently funds 16 antidepressants, that primary health organisations and district health boards (DHBs) fund psychotherapy, and that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is available in all DHBs. The Committee considered that there are currently no issues with access to funded pharmacological treatments for treatment-resistant depression or to ECT. The Committee recognised that access to psychological interventions could be a barrier.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that esketamine is the S-enantiomer of ketamine and is a non-selective, non-competitive, antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. The Committee noted that esketamine is Medsafe-approved for treatment-resistant depression in adults in conjunction with a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The Committee noted that esketamine is administered by intranasal spray (in single dose devices) and that the supplier advises that this is to be under the supervision of a healthcare professional, with a dosing frequency ranging from twice weekly to fortnightly. The Committee noted that the supplier advises patients need to be observed by a healthcare professional for two hours following every treatment to monitor for adverse events (preferably in a quiet room in a reclining chair) and that patients should not drive for 24 hours following each treatment.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supervised administration and post-treatment observation requirements proposed by the supplier would have significant resource implications for healthcare providers, especially in primary care and community pharmacies, and may also be a barrier for patients. The Committee considered that there was no clear evidence that esketamine would reduce hospital stays for patients with treatment-resistant depression. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the key evidence for esketamine comes from four randomised, double-blind, active-control clinical trials: TRANSFORM-1, TRANSFORM-2, TRANSFORM-3, and SUSTAIN-1. Each trial investigated the use of intranasal esketamine with a newly initiated antidepressant, compared with intranasal placebo with a newly initiated antidepressant, in adults with treatment-resistant depression. SUSTAIN-1 was a withdrawal trial and all the TRANSFORM trials were active treatment trials.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the TRANSFORM-1 trial assessed 346 patients with recurrent treatment-resistant depression, treated with 56 mg esketamine, 84 mg esketamine or placebo, all as twice weekly treatments <span style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\">(</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Efficacy+and+Safety+of+Fixed-Dose+Esketamine+Nasal+Spray+Combined+With+a+New+Oral+Antidepressant+in+Treatment-Resistant+Depression%3A+Results+of+a+Randomized%2C+Double-Blind%2C+Active-Controlled+Study\" target=\"_blank\">Fedgchin et al.

The Committee noted that study participants were only required to have one oral antidepressant fail them, and that this did not align with the population defined in the supplier\u2019s application. The Committee noted the failure to accrue the numbers of patients required by the study\u2019s power calculations.

The Committee noted poor outcome strength in the trials, and the relatively short duration of such trials relative to the duration of depression. The Committee questioned whether the four trials adequately demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in patient outcomes, even in those trials that reached statistical significance. The Committee considered that it was difficult to clearly ascertain from the trials what proportion of treatment benefit was due to esketamine and what was due to the new oral antidepressant agent commenced at the same time as esketamine. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a research article by Leucht et al (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716315932?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: blue;\">J Aff Disord. 2017;210:287-93</a>) that was not included in the supplier\u2019s application and the authors included Janssen employees; the article reported that a reduction in MADRS score of eight or greater indicated depression remission. The Committee considered a MADRS reduction of eight or greater was needed to represent a clinically meaningful response, particularly in light of clinical trials that show absolute reductions in excess of 12 in treatment and placebo arms. The Committee noted that the MADRS is not commonly employed in clinical practice and becomes less reliable with repeated use, which would result in considerable practical difficulties in the use of the scale as a monitoring tool in a New Zealand clinical setting, with particular challenges for test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it is well recognised that when patients are enrolled in a clinical trial for depression, an improvement in their depressive symptoms is often observed. A similar positive effect is seen in clinical practice for patients with depression who have regular contact with healthcare services. Members considered that this effect could also occur with esketamine in clinical practice, due to the once or twice weekly dosing and post-administration supervision recommended by the supplier. </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted adverse events such as dissociation, somnolence and dizziness observed with esketamine treatment were demonstrated in all clinical trials. The Committee considered that trial participants were unlikely to have been adequately blinded due to the adverse events associated with esketamine treatment. The Committee also considered that maintaining blinding in any esketamine trial on this basis would be very difficult. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is used recreationally for its dissociative effects, and considered that these effects of esketamine may encourage its long-term use. The Committee noted the long-term implications of esketamine use are unclear, with long-term safety data not yet available. Members considered that patients may develop tolerance to esketamine over time and that this would result in higher doses needing to be prescribed, over and above the maximum 84 mg (three devices) twice weekly dose proposed by the supplier.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is a drug of abuse and that esketamine has the same potential to be abused. The Committee considered that esketamine may in fact have a higher abuse potential than ketamine<i>.</i> Both of these drugs are classified as a Class 4 Controlled Drugs. The Committee noted the supplier had proposed a risk mitigation plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of misuse of esketamine. The RMP proposed to exclude patients with a history of drug or alcohol misuse from being prescribed esketamine, that dispensing and administration of esketamine would occur only by appropriately trained healthcare professionals at approved health centres, that there would be a restricted supply chain with surveillance and stock distribution to RMP-trained sites only, and the device is designed to minimise residual misuse.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, contrary to the supplier\u2019s proposed RMP, in practice some patients would likely be dispensed esketamine to take home, which would increase the risk of misuse and/or diversion. The Committee considered that excluding patients with alcohol and drug history from being prescribed esketamine would likely make little difference to the potential for misuse and could be discriminatory to a high-need vulnerable population that has high mental health co-morbidities. The Committee noted that, despite the RMP, there is no technical requirement to adhere to this plan, and considered that the implementation of such a RMP in New Zealand would be impractical and would likely carry a significant cost.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supplier may have underestimated the infrastructure services needed to support the safe use of esketamine. The Committee considered that esketamine would have a significant impact on health sector expenditure and result in a high resource burden due to the risk of misuse, device disposal costs, approved facilities for the supervision of administration and post-treatment monitoring, managing pharmacy requirements for controlled drugs, and increased demand for mental health specialist services. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were significant costs related to the post-administration monitoring period recommended by the supplier, including two hours of supervision and blood pressure monitoring by a health professional, and restrictions on patients as they are unable to drive for 24 hours after each treatment session (the latter could be especially problematic for patients who live rurally). The Committee also noted that the post-administration effects of esketamine may also impair the ability of patients to undertake other activities, such as being a care-giver for family members including children. The Committee also noted the environmental impact of single-use devices, particularly given that some patients would require three devices up to twice weekly.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that best clinical practice approaches to the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression involve reassessing the diagnosis, then optimising the dose and duration of antidepressant, and considering what adjunctive treatment would be appropriate including psychosocial support. Members noted that this comprehensive management approach would require doctor appointments considerably longer than the standard 15 minutes usually provided by general practitioners. The Committee noted that this is generally a specialist assessment and requires more time. The Committee noted that there has been a significant increase in people referred to secondary care mental health services. </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that due to the resource demands on primary and secondary healthcare services, there is a risk that patients may be commenced on esketamine by their general practitioner ahead of a thorough reassessment of diagnosis or other clinical approaches being implemented to manage depression, and this would have the effect of increasing the risk of inappropriate prescribing and increasing the size of the patient population that could be prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that up to 80% of patients with depression would describe suicide ideation at some point and this would make them eligible for esketamine, significantly increasing the eligible patient pool.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that current standard of care management of patients with treatment-resistant depression would consist of assessment by a secondary care professional with dose adjustment and modification of a patient\u2019s pharmacotherapy, and that this management would be the appropriate comparator in the requested patient population.</p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribing esketamine in a primary care setting may present significant risks to best clinical management of patients, noting that there are varying severities of treatment-resistant depression. The Committee noted that the supplier proposes esketamine treatment be initiated either by a psychiatrist or by a medical practitioner who has consulted with a psychiatrist. Members considered that it would be clinically difficult for psychiatrists to make and/or confirm a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression via a telephone conversation with the patient\u2019s general practitioner; and that a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression by a psychiatrist can only be made adequately by assessing the patient directly. The Committee considered that this pressure on primary care resource and limited consultation with a psychiatrist may lead to inappropriate use of esketamine when alternative treatment options e.g. non-pharmacological interventions or augmentation of current therapies, may be more clinically suitable. </p><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the supplier had proposed Special Authority criteria, however, members considered these had a number of practical limitations, including the requirement that esketamine be initiated by a psychiatrist or on the advice on a psychiatrist. As noted above, the adequate diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression in a New Zealand setting requires assessment by a psychiatrist, and there are health sector resource constraints on accessing a psychiatrist. The Committee noted the proposed Special Authority criteria excluded patients who are current or previous users of illegal drugs, and as noted above this patient group often has high health needs. Under the proposed criteria, the supplier indicated about 10,000 patients could be eligible for treatment with esketamine, however, the Committee considered that potentially all patients with treatment-resistant depression (110,000) could be eligible and access esketamine, and this number could increase significantly if patients with a single episode of depression with suicidality were added. The Committee noted that there were no exit or stopping criteria proposed by the supplier, and that this could potentially result in patients remaining on esketamine indefinitely. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mental health is currently a Government priority, however members considered that funding another pharmacotherapy, such as esketamine, may not be the best mechanism to achieve a clinically meaningful, positive impact for New Zealanders with treatment-resistant depression. The Committee considered that esketamine would not offer significant health benefits over the funded pharmacotherapies, due to the lack of meaningful clinical benefit in the New Zealand setting and the associated risks of esketamine use to individuals and society. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that treatment-resistant pain has contributed to significant opioid dependency in society, and considered that there may be a risk of a similar impact occurring with esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered that esketamine would not meet any unmet health need in treatment-resistant depression, and that any new investment would be more beneficially directed to supporting and strengthening mental health services in the community where there is a clearly recognised and significant unmet health need and to increasing access to secondary care services where, due to health sector resource constraints, it is difficult to access a psychiatrist.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that ketamine (or its enantiomers) are not currently included in the RANZCP guidelines for treatment-resistant depression.

The Committee noted that women, M\u0101ori, people living in rural areas and people with chronic physical illness and cancer are disproportionately affected by depression. The Committee noted that patients with treatment-resistant depression are not able to achieve relief from these symptoms and therefore the disease impacts this population to a great extent, resulting in a high health need and a high burden of disease. The Committee also noted that there are also significant emotional, psychiatric, existential and financial health needs for the families and wh\u0101nau of people with treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC currently funds 16 antidepressants, that primary health organisations and district health boards (DHBs) fund psychotherapy, and that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is available in all DHBs.

The Committee noted that esketamine is Medsafe-approved for treatment-resistant depression in adults in conjunction with a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The Committee noted that esketamine is administered by intranasal spray (in single dose devices) and that the supplier advises that this is to be under the supervision of a healthcare professional, with a dosing frequency ranging from twice weekly to fortnightly. The Committee noted that the supplier advises patients need to be observed by a healthcare professional for two hours following every treatment to monitor for adverse events (preferably in a quiet room in a reclining chair) and that patients should not drive for 24 hours following each treatment.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supervised administration and post-treatment observation requirements proposed by the supplier would have significant resource implications for healthcare providers, especially in primary care and community pharmacies, and may also be a barrier for patients.

The Committee noted that study participants were only required to have one oral antidepressant fail them, and that this did not align with the population defined in the supplier\u2019s application. The Committee noted the failure to accrue the numbers of patients required by the study\u2019s power calculations. The Committee also noted stable remitters and responders who continued to receive esketamine relapsed significantly less than patients who were randomised to placebo (stable remission: 26.7% esketamine vs 45.3% placebo relapsed (HR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.29, 0.84; P=0.003); stable response patients: 25.8% esketamine vs 57.6% placebo (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.55; P&lt;0.001). The Committee noted that 82.2% of the esketamine group experienced adverse events compared with 45.5% of the placebo group. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence from the above clinical trials was of good quality generally, but this quality translated poorly to the New Zealand setting. The Committee noted poor outcome strength in the trials, and the relatively short duration of such trials relative to the duration of depression. The Committee questioned whether the four trials adequately demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in patient outcomes, even in those trials that reached statistical significance. The Committee considered that it was difficult to clearly ascertain from the trials what proportion of treatment benefit was due to esketamine and what was due to the new oral antidepressant agent commenced at the same time as esketamine. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a research article by Leucht et al (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716315932?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: blue;\">J Aff Disord. 2017;210:287-93</a>) that was not included in the supplier\u2019s application and the authors included Janssen employees; the article reported that a reduction in MADRS score of eight or greater indicated depression remission. The Committee considered a MADRS reduction of eight or greater was needed to represent a clinically meaningful response, particularly in light of clinical trials that show absolute reductions in excess of 12 in treatment and placebo arms. The Committee noted that the MADRS is not commonly employed in clinical practice and becomes less reliable with repeated use, which would result in considerable practical difficulties in the use of the scale as a monitoring tool in a New Zealand clinical setting, with particular challenges for test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it is well recognised that when patients are enrolled in a clinical trial for depression, an improvement in their depressive symptoms is often observed. A similar positive effect is seen in clinical practice for patients with depression who have regular contact with healthcare services. Members considered that this effect could also occur with esketamine in clinical practice, due to the once or twice weekly dosing and post-administration supervision recommended by the supplier. </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted adverse events such as dissociation, somnolence and dizziness observed with esketamine treatment were demonstrated in all clinical trials. The Committee considered that trial participants were unlikely to have been adequately blinded due to the adverse events associated with esketamine treatment. The Committee also considered that maintaining blinding in any esketamine trial on this basis would be very difficult. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is used recreationally for its dissociative effects, and considered that these effects of esketamine may encourage its long-term use. The Committee noted the long-term implications of esketamine use are unclear, with long-term safety data not yet available. Members considered that patients may develop tolerance to esketamine over time and that this would result in higher doses needing to be prescribed, over and above the maximum 84 mg (three devices) twice weekly dose proposed by the supplier.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is a drug of abuse and that esketamine has the same potential to be abused. The Committee considered that esketamine may in fact have a higher abuse potential than ketamine<i>.</i> Both of these drugs are classified as a Class 4 Controlled Drugs. The Committee noted the supplier had proposed a risk mitigation plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of misuse of esketamine. The RMP proposed to exclude patients with a history of drug or alcohol misuse from being prescribed esketamine, that dispensing and administration of esketamine would occur only by appropriately trained healthcare professionals at approved health centres, that there would be a restricted supply chain with surveillance and stock distribution to RMP-trained sites only, and the device is designed to minimise residual misuse.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, contrary to the supplier\u2019s proposed RMP, in practice some patients would likely be dispensed esketamine to take home, which would increase the risk of misuse and/or diversion. The Committee considered that excluding patients with alcohol and drug history from being prescribed esketamine would likely make little difference to the potential for misuse and could be discriminatory to a high-need vulnerable population that has high mental health co-morbidities. The Committee noted that, despite the RMP, there is no technical requirement to adhere to this plan, and considered that the implementation of such a RMP in New Zealand would be impractical and would likely carry a significant cost.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supplier may have underestimated the infrastructure services needed to support the safe use of esketamine. The Committee considered that esketamine would have a significant impact on health sector expenditure and result in a high resource burden due to the risk of misuse, device disposal costs, approved facilities for the supervision of administration and post-treatment monitoring, managing pharmacy requirements for controlled drugs, and increased demand for mental health specialist services. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were significant costs related to the post-administration monitoring period recommended by the supplier, including two hours of supervision and blood pressure monitoring by a health professional, and restrictions on patients as they are unable to drive for 24 hours after each treatment session (the latter could be especially problematic for patients who live rurally). The Committee also noted that the post-administration effects of esketamine may also impair the ability of patients to undertake other activities, such as being a care-giver for family members including children. The Committee also noted the environmental impact of single-use devices, particularly given that some patients would require three devices up to twice weekly.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that best clinical practice approaches to the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression involve reassessing the diagnosis, then optimising the dose and duration of antidepressant, and considering what adjunctive treatment would be appropriate including psychosocial support. Members noted that this comprehensive management approach would require doctor appointments considerably longer than the standard 15 minutes usually provided by general practitioners. The Committee noted that this is generally a specialist assessment and requires more time. The Committee noted that there has been a significant increase in people referred to secondary care mental health services. </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that due to the resource demands on primary and secondary healthcare services, there is a risk that patients may be commenced on esketamine by their general practitioner ahead of a thorough reassessment of diagnosis or other clinical approaches being implemented to manage depression, and this would have the effect of increasing the risk of inappropriate prescribing and increasing the size of the patient population that could be prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that up to 80% of patients with depression would describe suicide ideation at some point and this would make them eligible for esketamine, significantly increasing the eligible patient pool.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that current standard of care management of patients with treatment-resistant depression would consist of assessment by a secondary care professional with dose adjustment and modification of a patient\u2019s pharmacotherapy, and that this management would be the appropriate comparator in the requested patient population.</p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribing esketamine in a primary care setting may present significant risks to best clinical management of patients, noting that there are varying severities of treatment-resistant depression. The Committee noted that the supplier proposes esketamine treatment be initiated either by a psychiatrist or by a medical practitioner who has consulted with a psychiatrist. Members considered that it would be clinically difficult for psychiatrists to make and/or confirm a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression via a telephone conversation with the patient\u2019s general practitioner; and that a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression by a psychiatrist can only be made adequately by assessing the patient directly. The Committee considered that this pressure on primary care resource and limited consultation with a psychiatrist may lead to inappropriate use of esketamine when alternative treatment options e.g. non-pharmacological interventions or augmentation of current therapies, may be more clinically suitable. </p><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the supplier had proposed Special Authority criteria, however, members considered these had a number of practical limitations, including the requirement that esketamine be initiated by a psychiatrist or on the advice on a psychiatrist. As noted above, the adequate diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression in a New Zealand setting requires assessment by a psychiatrist, and there are health sector resource constraints on accessing a psychiatrist. The Committee noted the proposed Special Authority criteria excluded patients who are current or previous users of illegal drugs, and as noted above this patient group often has high health needs. Under the proposed criteria, the supplier indicated about 10,000 patients could be eligible for treatment with esketamine, however, the Committee considered that potentially all patients with treatment-resistant depression (110,000) could be eligible and access esketamine, and this number could increase significantly if patients with a single episode of depression with suicidality were added. The Committee noted that there were no exit or stopping criteria proposed by the supplier, and that this could potentially result in patients remaining on esketamine indefinitely. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mental health is currently a Government priority, however members considered that funding another pharmacotherapy, such as esketamine, may not be the best mechanism to achieve a clinically meaningful, positive impact for New Zealanders with treatment-resistant depression. The Committee considered that esketamine would not offer significant health benefits over the funded pharmacotherapies, due to the lack of meaningful clinical benefit in the New Zealand setting and the associated risks of esketamine use to individuals and society. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that treatment-resistant pain has contributed to significant opioid dependency in society, and considered that there may be a risk of a similar impact occurring with esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered that esketamine would not meet any unmet health need in treatment-resistant depression, and that any new investment would be more beneficially directed to supporting and strengthening mental health services in the community where there is a clearly recognised and significant unmet health need and to increasing access to secondary care services where, due to health sector resource constraints, it is difficult to access a psychiatrist.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that ketamine (or its enantiomers) are not currently included in the RANZCP guidelines for treatment-resistant depression. The Committee noted that in clinical practice, often patients have not been tried on adequate doses and durations of antidepressants and in a New Zealand setting this can make it difficult to identify patients whose depression is treatment-resistant. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that relative to other countries, New Zealand has a high burden of mental health conditions. The Committee noted approximately 16% of New Zealanders experience depression in their lifetime and approximately 30% of patients with depression are reported to be treatment-resistant, equating to approximately 350,000 patients with depression and 110,000 with treatment-resistant depression in New Zealand<i>.</i> Members also noted that treatment-resistant depression is not necessarily severe depression; treatment-resistant depression can present as mild, moderate or severe. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients with depression can experience symptoms such as a persistent sad, anxious or empty mood, feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia. The Committee noted that women, M\u0101ori, people living in rural areas and people with chronic physical illness and cancer are disproportionately affected by depression. The Committee noted that patients with treatment-resistant depression are not able to achieve relief from these symptoms and therefore the disease impacts this population to a great extent, resulting in a high health need and a high burden of disease. The Committee also noted that there are also significant emotional, psychiatric, existential and financial health needs for the families and wh\u0101nau of people with treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC currently funds 16 antidepressants, that primary health organisations and district health boards (DHBs) fund psychotherapy, and that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is available in all DHBs. The Committee considered that there are currently no issues with access to funded pharmacological treatments for treatment-resistant depression or to ECT. The Committee recognised that access to psychological interventions could be a barrier.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that esketamine is the S-enantiomer of ketamine and is a non-selective, non-competitive, antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. The Committee noted that esketamine is Medsafe-approved for treatment-resistant depression in adults in conjunction with a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The Committee noted that esketamine is administered by intranasal spray (in single dose devices) and that the supplier advises that this is to be under the supervision of a healthcare professional, with a dosing frequency ranging from twice weekly to fortnightly. The Committee noted that the supplier advises patients need to be observed by a healthcare professional for two hours following every treatment to monitor for adverse events (preferably in a quiet room in a reclining chair) and that patients should not drive for 24 hours following each treatment.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supervised administration and post-treatment observation requirements proposed by the supplier would have significant resource implications for healthcare providers, especially in primary care and community pharmacies, and may also be a barrier for patients.

Each trial investigated the use of intranasal esketamine with a newly initiated antidepressant, compared with intranasal placebo with a newly initiated antidepressant, in adults with treatment-resistant depression. SUSTAIN-1 was a withdrawal trial and all the TRANSFORM trials were active treatment trials.</p><p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the TRANSFORM-1 trial assessed 346 patients with recurrent treatment-resistant depression, treated with 56 mg esketamine, 84 mg esketamine or placebo, all as twice weekly treatments <span style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\">(</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Efficacy+and+Safety+of+Fixed-Dose+Esketamine+Nasal+Spray+Combined+With+a+New+Oral+Antidepressant+in+Treatment-Resistant+Depression%3A+Results+of+a+Randomized%2C+Double-Blind%2C+Active-Controlled+Study\" target=\"_blank\">Fedgchin et al.

The Committee noted both the esketamine and placebo groups were observed to have a reduction in MADRS score, but considered that the main driver of this reduction was unclear; the Committee could not determine if the reduction in MADRS was related to the new antidepressant or esketamine. The Committee noted no subgroup analysis by new drug was undertaken (and considered the trial would not have been powered for this). The Committee noted the statistically significant reduction in MADRS score of four points in the esketamine group compared with placebo after 28 days of treatment (95% CI: -7.31, -0.64; p=0.020) and that this was less than the absolute reduction in MADRS scores in both groups from initiation to end point.

JAMA. 2019; 76:893-903</a>). The Committee noted that study participants were only required to have one oral antidepressant fail them, and that this did not align with the population defined in the supplier\u2019s application. The Committee noted the failure to accrue the numbers of patients required by the study\u2019s power calculations. The Committee also noted stable remitters and responders who continued to receive esketamine relapsed significantly less than patients who were randomised to placebo (stable remission: 26.7% esketamine vs 45.3% placebo relapsed (HR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.29, 0.84; P=0.003); stable response patients: 25.8% esketamine vs 57.6% placebo (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.55; P&lt;0.001). The Committee noted that 82.2% of the esketamine group experienced adverse events compared with 45.5% of the placebo group. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence from the above clinical trials was of good quality generally, but this quality translated poorly to the New Zealand setting. The Committee noted poor outcome strength in the trials, and the relatively short duration of such trials relative to the duration of depression. The Committee questioned whether the four trials adequately demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in patient outcomes, even in those trials that reached statistical significance. The Committee considered that it was difficult to clearly ascertain from the trials what proportion of treatment benefit was due to esketamine and what was due to the new oral antidepressant agent commenced at the same time as esketamine. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a research article by Leucht et al (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716315932?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: blue;\">J Aff Disord. 2017;210:287-93</a>) that was not included in the supplier\u2019s application and the authors included Janssen employees; the article reported that a reduction in MADRS score of eight or greater indicated depression remission. The Committee considered a MADRS reduction of eight or greater was needed to represent a clinically meaningful response, particularly in light of clinical trials that show absolute reductions in excess of 12 in treatment and placebo arms. The Committee noted that the MADRS is not commonly employed in clinical practice and becomes less reliable with repeated use, which would result in considerable practical difficulties in the use of the scale as a monitoring tool in a New Zealand clinical setting, with particular challenges for test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities. </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it is well recognised that when patients are enrolled in a clinical trial for depression, an improvement in their depressive symptoms is often observed. A similar positive effect is seen in clinical practice for patients with depression who have regular contact with healthcare services. Members considered that this effect could also occur with esketamine in clinical practice, due to the once or twice weekly dosing and post-administration supervision recommended by the supplier. </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted adverse events such as dissociation, somnolence and dizziness observed with esketamine treatment were demonstrated in all clinical trials. The Committee considered that trial participants were unlikely to have been adequately blinded due to the adverse events associated with esketamine treatment. The Committee also considered that maintaining blinding in any esketamine trial on this basis would be very difficult. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is used recreationally for its dissociative effects, and considered that these effects of esketamine may encourage its long-term use. The Committee noted the long-term implications of esketamine use are unclear, with long-term safety data not yet available. Members considered that patients may develop tolerance to esketamine over time and that this would result in higher doses needing to be prescribed, over and above the maximum 84 mg (three devices) twice weekly dose proposed by the supplier.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ketamine is a drug of abuse and that esketamine has the same potential to be abused. The Committee considered that esketamine may in fact have a higher abuse potential than ketamine<i>.</i> Both of these drugs are classified as a Class 4 Controlled Drugs. The Committee noted the supplier had proposed a risk mitigation plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of misuse of esketamine. The RMP proposed to exclude patients with a history of drug or alcohol misuse from being prescribed esketamine, that dispensing and administration of esketamine would occur only by appropriately trained healthcare professionals at approved health centres, that there would be a restricted supply chain with surveillance and stock distribution to RMP-trained sites only, and the device is designed to minimise residual misuse.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, contrary to the supplier\u2019s proposed RMP, in practice some patients would likely be dispensed esketamine to take home, which would increase the risk of misuse and/or diversion. The Committee considered that excluding patients with alcohol and drug history from being prescribed esketamine would likely make little difference to the potential for misuse and could be discriminatory to a high-need vulnerable population that has high mental health co-morbidities. The Committee noted that, despite the RMP, there is no technical requirement to adhere to this plan, and considered that the implementation of such a RMP in New Zealand would be impractical and would likely carry a significant cost.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the supplier may have underestimated the infrastructure services needed to support the safe use of esketamine. The Committee considered that esketamine would have a significant impact on health sector expenditure and result in a high resource burden due to the risk of misuse, device disposal costs, approved facilities for the supervision of administration and post-treatment monitoring, managing pharmacy requirements for controlled drugs, and increased demand for mental health specialist services. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there were significant costs related to the post-administration monitoring period recommended by the supplier, including two hours of supervision and blood pressure monitoring by a health professional, and restrictions on patients as they are unable to drive for 24 hours after each treatment session (the latter could be especially problematic for patients who live rurally). The Committee also noted that the post-administration effects of esketamine may also impair the ability of patients to undertake other activities, such as being a care-giver for family members including children. The Committee also noted the environmental impact of single-use devices, particularly given that some patients would require three devices up to twice weekly.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that best clinical practice approaches to the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression involve reassessing the diagnosis, then optimising the dose and duration of antidepressant, and considering what adjunctive treatment would be appropriate including psychosocial support. Members noted that this comprehensive management approach would require doctor appointments considerably longer than the standard 15 minutes usually provided by general practitioners. The Committee noted that this is generally a specialist assessment and requires more time. The Committee noted that there has been a significant increase in people referred to secondary care mental health services. </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that due to the resource demands on primary and secondary healthcare services, there is a risk that patients may be commenced on esketamine by their general practitioner ahead of a thorough reassessment of diagnosis or other clinical approaches being implemented to manage depression, and this would have the effect of increasing the risk of inappropriate prescribing and increasing the size of the patient population that could be prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that up to 80% of patients with depression would describe suicide ideation at some point and this would make them eligible for esketamine, significantly increasing the eligible patient pool.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that current standard of care management of patients with treatment-resistant depression would consist of assessment by a secondary care professional with dose adjustment and modification of a patient\u2019s pharmacotherapy, and that this management would be the appropriate comparator in the requested patient population.</p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribing esketamine in a primary care setting may present significant risks to best clinical management of patients, noting that there are varying severities of treatment-resistant depression. The Committee noted that the supplier proposes esketamine treatment be initiated either by a psychiatrist or by a medical practitioner who has consulted with a psychiatrist. Members considered that it would be clinically difficult for psychiatrists to make and/or confirm a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression via a telephone conversation with the patient\u2019s general practitioner; and that a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression by a psychiatrist can only be made adequately by assessing the patient directly. The Committee considered that this pressure on primary care resource and limited consultation with a psychiatrist may lead to inappropriate use of esketamine when alternative treatment options e.g. non-pharmacological interventions or augmentation of current therapies, may be more clinically suitable. </p><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the supplier had proposed Special Authority criteria, however, members considered these had a number of practical limitations, including the requirement that esketamine be initiated by a psychiatrist or on the advice on a psychiatrist. As noted above, the adequate diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression in a New Zealand setting requires assessment by a psychiatrist, and there are health sector resource constraints on accessing a psychiatrist. The Committee noted the proposed Special Authority criteria excluded patients who are current or previous users of illegal drugs, and as noted above this patient group often has high health needs. Under the proposed criteria, the supplier indicated about 10,000 patients could be eligible for treatment with esketamine, however, the Committee considered that potentially all patients with treatment-resistant depression (110,000) could be eligible and access esketamine, and this number could increase significantly if patients with a single episode of depression with suicidality were added. The Committee noted that there were no exit or stopping criteria proposed by the supplier, and that this could potentially result in patients remaining on esketamine indefinitely. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mental health is currently a Government priority, however members considered that funding another pharmacotherapy, such as esketamine, may not be the best mechanism to achieve a clinically meaningful, positive impact for New Zealanders with treatment-resistant depression. The Committee considered that esketamine would not offer significant health benefits over the funded pharmacotherapies, due to the lack of meaningful clinical benefit in the New Zealand setting and the associated risks of esketamine use to individuals and society. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted that treatment-resistant pain has contributed to significant opioid dependency in society, and considered that there may be a risk of a similar impact occurring with esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.</p><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also considered that esketamine would not meet any unmet health need in treatment-resistant depression, and that any new investment would be more beneficially directed to supporting and strengthening mental health services in the community where there is a clearly recognised and significant unmet health need and to increasing access to secondary care services where, due to health sector resource constraints, it is difficult to access a psychiatrist.\u00a0</p>",
