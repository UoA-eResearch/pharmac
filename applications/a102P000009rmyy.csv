J Thorac Oncol. 2021;16:1872-82</a>). The data reviewed for both included three-year follow-up data for atezolizumab and five-year follow-up data for pembrolizumab.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Phase III randomised controlled trials often assume a baseline hazard ratio (HR), and that the proportional change in hazard stays the same over time, so that theoretically the hazard ratios are the same at all time points which does not account for a time-treatment interaction. The Committee noted that deviations from proportional hazards are common for immunotherapy trials (57% of 263 trials studied), with hazard ratios dropping over time (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345838/"" target=""_blank"">Rahman et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25:6339-45</a>). The Committee noted that the changes in HR over time with immunotherapies is further confounded by cross-over within the trial and subsequent therapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the longer-term data from KEYNOTE-024 shows a smaller percentage benefit than the proportional hazard ratio would imply, but that there may be a small, yet undefined subpopulation with a longer-term benefit. The Committee also noted that earlier exposure to immunotherapy shows a greater benefit than those who received chemotherapy and then crossed over to pembrolizumab (ie the hazard ratio advantage for immunotherapy increases with time).</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the longer-term follow-up data for atezolizumab in Impower110 reported around 20% of patients experienced long term survival and considered this similar to the long-term results reported for pembrolizumab.</p><h3><em>Selectivity and specificity of PD-L1 antibodies</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that immunohistochemical analysis testing for PD-L1 requires many components, including antigens, antibodies, testing platforms and their associated software. The Committee noted that immunohistochemical tests can either be commercially marketed biomarkers (externally validated package and linked to an FDA approval as a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic) or lab developed (with potentially uncertain validation standards). The Committee noted that immunohistochemistry requires subjective assessment of staining and can be assessed with inter-reader reliability to determine stability of the subjective quantitative assessment by pathologists. The Committee noted that the tests are usually developed prior to trial outcomes data being available and are optimised to laboratory-based criteria and subsequently applied to clinical studies.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that atezolizumab has two FDA approved diagnostic tests; one using the SP263 antibody, and one using the SP142 antibody. The Committee noted that the use of SP263 for lung cancer was based on IMpower010, and that this trial was underpowered to infer the utility of PD-L1 stain percentage as a predictor of disease-free survival using this assay. The Committee noted however that there was high test-retest reliability, in that, if there was a negative test, resampling would not result in a positive result.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for the use of the SP142 assay is based on the IMpower110 trial where it was reported that PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of tumour cells or ≥10 tumour infiltrating immune cells determined by the SP142 assay may be associated with enhanced overall survival with atezolizumab in NSCLC patients.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the difference between the SP142 assay and the SP263 assay may be due to the difference in evidential threshold requirements for companion versus complimentary tests, and that these tests may select for different populations.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the approved antibody for pembrolizumab is the 22C3 assay. The Committee considered that based on the BLUEPRINT study (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27913228/"" target=""_blank"">Hirsch et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2017;12:208-22</a>), the SP263 and 22C3 assays are largely interchangeable. However, the Committee noted that none of the immunohistochemistry assays have been validated with other scoring systems and that they are sensitive to the assay package which may have commercial implications for replication.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that different assays define different population sizes, with the least sensitive assay (SP142) defining the smallest population eligible for monotherapy treatment based on PD-L1 expression. The Committee noted that there was high concordance between the SP263 and 22C3 antibodies from BLUEPRINT2 (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800747/"" target=""_blank"">Taso et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2018;13:1302-11</a>), which select for larger populations and that these would likely be the antibodies used if PD-L1 testing were required for access to monotherapy.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and population size of atezolizumab for people with high expression of PD-L1 identified by the various antibodies would come from the evidence for the SP263 assay (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997907/"" target=""_blank"">Herbst et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383;1328-39</a> and <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265434/"" target=""_blank"">Jassem et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2021;16:1872-82</a>). The Committee considered that the evidence for efficacy and population size of pembrolizumab would be derived from the KEYNOTE-024 trial (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33872070/"" target=""_blank"">Reck et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:2339-49</a>).</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee was not aware of any evidence that any given antibody works differently across different ethnicities and populations, or the prevalence of PD-L1 expression by ethnicity. The Committee considered that either atezolizumab or pembrolizumab would likely provide a similar benefit in first line monotherapy, but that this efficacy is derived from the population size inferred from the relevant companion diagnostic.</p><h3><em>PD-L1 testing and implications</em></h3><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the evidence for testing in these cases is tied to specific devices and instrumentation with explicit external criteria for scoring, which a lab developed test may not necessarily achieve. The Committee noted that funding an ICI treatment tied to a specific test would require testing centres to be locked into infrastructure development for that particular test. The Committee noted that although some assays may be interchangeable, the performance of validated antibodies with other scoring systems is unknown. The Committee noted that if centres do not commit to the currently validated tests, and instead developed their own or used other laboratory developed tests, then the extent to which the process has been validated would be up to the individual laboratory, which may lead to variation between centres.\xa0</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing biomarker modalities for predicting response to PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors for ten different solid tumour types (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318407/"" target=""_blank"">Lu et al. JAMA Oncol. 2019;5:1195-1204</a>). The Committee noted that when each modality was evaluated with summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, regardless of antibody used, had an area under the curve score of 0.65 (p &lt; .001). The Committee considered that this indicated that immunohistochemical testing as a predictor of response to an ICI may be limited.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis of individual-level data from 14 randomised clinical trials to investigate the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression scores on overall survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35050777/"" target=""_blank"">Arfe et al. JCO Precis Oncol. 2020;4:1196-1206</a>). The Committee considered that higher staining may not necessarily be predictive of response, but rather a slightly longer overall survival than those with low or no staining.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that current evidence supports that some antibodies used in immunohistochemistry are more sensitive than others (meaning that populations eligible for treatment would differ between tests), and that the scoring systems include different elements and have often not been cross-compared with different antibodies. The Committee also considered that the evidence supporting the scoring systems as being predictive of an individual’s response is weak but noted that by FDA and EMA regulatory standards these define treatment-eligible populations.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, generally, evidence for predictive benefit of immunohistochemical assays for ICI agents is limited, and that evidence for differing sensitivity and specificity of each antibody is of moderate to good quality. The Committee noted that less sensitive assays define smaller populations. The Committee considered that the evidence supporting the value of PD-L1 testing for clinical decision making is limited, but that this inference would benefit from the reporting of outcomes for people with high expression of PD-L1 compared to those with no expression of PD-L1 in the relevant trials. The Committee considered that the primary benefit of PD-L1 testing would occur when used in conjunction with an individual’s performance status to inform treatment decision making (ie whether or not they should receive ICI monotherapy or chemotherapy).</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2022-04-08-Cancer-Treatments-AC-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2022</a>, CTAC noted the sub-group analysis of the patient population with PD-L1 1-49% in KEYNOTE 042 indicated minimal benefit from pembrolizumab therapy and the benefit seen in the PD-L1 &gt;1% cohort was skewed by the significant benefit seen from the PD-L1 &gt;50% cohort.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in New Zealand, MedSafe does not require a specific test to be used with ICIs, simply a “validated test”, but that the language specific to each scoring system is used for each agent, which theoretically ties the ICI to its companion or complimentary diagnostic. The Committee noted that it is unclear whether or not the same holds for the identified scoring system associated with each validated test. The Committee considered that the definition of a validated test in the New Zealand context is unclear. The Committee considered that requiring infrastructure and skill development around specific testing has short term implications in terms of which ICI agents are used, but also in the long term if other ICIs are funded in future which may require a different diagnostic test.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab were funded in this setting, there would be benefit in the supplier offering access to testing in the short term but noted that this may mean that testing centres are locked into using specific testing platforms in the long term. The Committee considered it important that the validation of an in-house lab test would be derived from its ability to identify the same population as the relevant complimentary/companion diagnostics.</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there may be variable access to diagnostic biopsy procedures in New Zealand currently, primarily those with less access to tertiary hospitals, but that Pharmac’s ability to impact this inequity was limited. The Committee considered that, in addition to access to PD-L1 testing, access to diagnostic biopsy procedures (and the obtaining of sufficient tissue amounts) to enable the testing may present a barrier to accessing monotherapy. The Committee considered that, in the absence of having available tissue from biopsy, it may be appropriate to offer individuals first-line ICI monotherapy for NSCLC if they are not fit to receive combination with chemotherapy. The Committee considered that overall, approximately 10% would not be able to undergo the biopsy, and that this group would need to be accounted for in population number estimates.</p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the use of immunotherapy in individuals with EGFR or ALK activating mutations would not be evidence based. The Committee however considered that confirmation of EGFR and ALK activating mutations would be sought if possible.

The data reviewed for both included three-year follow-up data for atezolizumab and five-year follow-up data for pembrolizumab.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Phase III randomised controlled trials often assume a baseline hazard ratio (HR), and that the proportional change in hazard stays the same over time, so that theoretically the hazard ratios are the same at all time points which does not account for a time-treatment interaction. The Committee noted that deviations from proportional hazards are common for immunotherapy trials (57% of 263 trials studied), with hazard ratios dropping over time (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345838/"" target=""_blank"">Rahman et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25:6339-45</a>). The Committee noted that the changes in HR over time with immunotherapies is further confounded by cross-over within the trial and subsequent therapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the longer-term data from KEYNOTE-024 shows a smaller percentage benefit than the proportional hazard ratio would imply, but that there may be a small, yet undefined subpopulation with a longer-term benefit. The Committee also noted that earlier exposure to immunotherapy shows a greater benefit than those who received chemotherapy and then crossed over to pembrolizumab (ie the hazard ratio advantage for immunotherapy increases with time).</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the longer-term follow-up data for atezolizumab in Impower110 reported around 20% of patients experienced long term survival and considered this similar to the long-term results reported for pembrolizumab.</p><h3><em>Selectivity and specificity of PD-L1 antibodies</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that immunohistochemical analysis testing for PD-L1 requires many components, including antigens, antibodies, testing platforms and their associated software. The Committee noted that immunohistochemical tests can either be commercially marketed biomarkers (externally validated package and linked to an FDA approval as a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic) or lab developed (with potentially uncertain validation standards). The Committee noted that immunohistochemistry requires subjective assessment of staining and can be assessed with inter-reader reliability to determine stability of the subjective quantitative assessment by pathologists. The Committee noted that the tests are usually developed prior to trial outcomes data being available and are optimised to laboratory-based criteria and subsequently applied to clinical studies.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that atezolizumab has two FDA approved diagnostic tests; one using the SP263 antibody, and one using the SP142 antibody. The Committee noted that the use of SP263 for lung cancer was based on IMpower010, and that this trial was underpowered to infer the utility of PD-L1 stain percentage as a predictor of disease-free survival using this assay. The Committee noted however that there was high test-retest reliability, in that, if there was a negative test, resampling would not result in a positive result.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for the use of the SP142 assay is based on the IMpower110 trial where it was reported that PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of tumour cells or ≥10 tumour infiltrating immune cells determined by the SP142 assay may be associated with enhanced overall survival with atezolizumab in NSCLC patients.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the difference between the SP142 assay and the SP263 assay may be due to the difference in evidential threshold requirements for companion versus complimentary tests, and that these tests may select for different populations.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the approved antibody for pembrolizumab is the 22C3 assay. The Committee considered that based on the BLUEPRINT study (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27913228/"" target=""_blank"">Hirsch et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2017;12:208-22</a>), the SP263 and 22C3 assays are largely interchangeable. However, the Committee noted that none of the immunohistochemistry assays have been validated with other scoring systems and that they are sensitive to the assay package which may have commercial implications for replication.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that different assays define different population sizes, with the least sensitive assay (SP142) defining the smallest population eligible for monotherapy treatment based on PD-L1 expression. The Committee noted that there was high concordance between the SP263 and 22C3 antibodies from BLUEPRINT2 (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800747/"" target=""_blank"">Taso et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2018;13:1302-11</a>), which select for larger populations and that these would likely be the antibodies used if PD-L1 testing were required for access to monotherapy.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and population size of atezolizumab for people with high expression of PD-L1 identified by the various antibodies would come from the evidence for the SP263 assay (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997907/"" target=""_blank"">Herbst et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383;1328-39</a> and <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265434/"" target=""_blank"">Jassem et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2021;16:1872-82</a>). The Committee considered that the evidence for efficacy and population size of pembrolizumab would be derived from the KEYNOTE-024 trial (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33872070/"" target=""_blank"">Reck et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:2339-49</a>).</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee was not aware of any evidence that any given antibody works differently across different ethnicities and populations, or the prevalence of PD-L1 expression by ethnicity. The Committee considered that either atezolizumab or pembrolizumab would likely provide a similar benefit in first line monotherapy, but that this efficacy is derived from the population size inferred from the relevant companion diagnostic.</p><h3><em>PD-L1 testing and implications</em></h3><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the evidence for testing in these cases is tied to specific devices and instrumentation with explicit external criteria for scoring, which a lab developed test may not necessarily achieve. The Committee noted that funding an ICI treatment tied to a specific test would require testing centres to be locked into infrastructure development for that particular test. The Committee noted that although some assays may be interchangeable, the performance of validated antibodies with other scoring systems is unknown. The Committee noted that if centres do not commit to the currently validated tests, and instead developed their own or used other laboratory developed tests, then the extent to which the process has been validated would be up to the individual laboratory, which may lead to variation between centres.\xa0</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing biomarker modalities for predicting response to PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors for ten different solid tumour types (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318407/"" target=""_blank"">Lu et al. JAMA Oncol. 2019;5:1195-1204</a>). The Committee noted that when each modality was evaluated with summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, regardless of antibody used, had an area under the curve score of 0.65 (p &lt; .001). The Committee considered that this indicated that immunohistochemical testing as a predictor of response to an ICI may be limited.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis of individual-level data from 14 randomised clinical trials to investigate the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression scores on overall survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35050777/"" target=""_blank"">Arfe et al. JCO Precis Oncol. 2020;4:1196-1206</a>). The Committee considered that higher staining may not necessarily be predictive of response, but rather a slightly longer overall survival than those with low or no staining.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that current evidence supports that some antibodies used in immunohistochemistry are more sensitive than others (meaning that populations eligible for treatment would differ between tests), and that the scoring systems include different elements and have often not been cross-compared with different antibodies. The Committee also considered that the evidence supporting the scoring systems as being predictive of an individual’s response is weak but noted that by FDA and EMA regulatory standards these define treatment-eligible populations.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, generally, evidence for predictive benefit of immunohistochemical assays for ICI agents is limited, and that evidence for differing sensitivity and specificity of each antibody is of moderate to good quality. The Committee noted that less sensitive assays define smaller populations. The Committee considered that the evidence supporting the value of PD-L1 testing for clinical decision making is limited, but that this inference would benefit from the reporting of outcomes for people with high expression of PD-L1 compared to those with no expression of PD-L1 in the relevant trials. The Committee considered that the primary benefit of PD-L1 testing would occur when used in conjunction with an individual’s performance status to inform treatment decision making (ie whether or not they should receive ICI monotherapy or chemotherapy).</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2022-04-08-Cancer-Treatments-AC-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2022</a>, CTAC noted the sub-group analysis of the patient population with PD-L1 1-49% in KEYNOTE 042 indicated minimal benefit from pembrolizumab therapy and the benefit seen in the PD-L1 &gt;1% cohort was skewed by the significant benefit seen from the PD-L1 &gt;50% cohort.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in New Zealand, MedSafe does not require a specific test to be used with ICIs, simply a “validated test”, but that the language specific to each scoring system is used for each agent, which theoretically ties the ICI to its companion or complimentary diagnostic. The Committee noted that it is unclear whether or not the same holds for the identified scoring system associated with each validated test. The Committee considered that the definition of a validated test in the New Zealand context is unclear. The Committee considered that requiring infrastructure and skill development around specific testing has short term implications in terms of which ICI agents are used, but also in the long term if other ICIs are funded in future which may require a different diagnostic test.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab were funded in this setting, there would be benefit in the supplier offering access to testing in the short term but noted that this may mean that testing centres are locked into using specific testing platforms in the long term. The Committee considered it important that the validation of an in-house lab test would be derived from its ability to identify the same population as the relevant complimentary/companion diagnostics.</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there may be variable access to diagnostic biopsy procedures in New Zealand currently, primarily those with less access to tertiary hospitals, but that Pharmac’s ability to impact this inequity was limited. The Committee considered that, in addition to access to PD-L1 testing, access to diagnostic biopsy procedures (and the obtaining of sufficient tissue amounts) to enable the testing may present a barrier to accessing monotherapy. The Committee considered that, in the absence of having available tissue from biopsy, it may be appropriate to offer individuals first-line ICI monotherapy for NSCLC if they are not fit to receive combination with chemotherapy. The Committee considered that overall, approximately 10% would not be able to undergo the biopsy, and that this group would need to be accounted for in population number estimates.</p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the use of immunotherapy in individuals with EGFR or ALK activating mutations would not be evidence based.

J Thorac Oncol. 2021;16:1872-82</a>). The data reviewed for both included three-year follow-up data for atezolizumab and five-year follow-up data for pembrolizumab.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Phase III randomised controlled trials often assume a baseline hazard ratio (HR), and that the proportional change in hazard stays the same over time, so that theoretically the hazard ratios are the same at all time points which does not account for a time-treatment interaction. The Committee noted that deviations from proportional hazards are common for immunotherapy trials (57% of 263 trials studied), with hazard ratios dropping over time (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345838/"" target=""_blank"">Rahman et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25:6339-45</a>). The Committee noted that the changes in HR over time with immunotherapies is further confounded by cross-over within the trial and subsequent therapies.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the longer-term data from KEYNOTE-024 shows a smaller percentage benefit than the proportional hazard ratio would imply, but that there may be a small, yet undefined subpopulation with a longer-term benefit. The Committee also noted that earlier exposure to immunotherapy shows a greater benefit than those who received chemotherapy and then crossed over to pembrolizumab (ie the hazard ratio advantage for immunotherapy increases with time).</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the longer-term follow-up data for atezolizumab in Impower110 reported around 20% of patients experienced long term survival and considered this similar to the long-term results reported for pembrolizumab.</p><h3><em>Selectivity and specificity of PD-L1 antibodies</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that immunohistochemical analysis testing for PD-L1 requires many components, including antigens, antibodies, testing platforms and their associated software. The Committee noted that immunohistochemical tests can either be commercially marketed biomarkers (externally validated package and linked to an FDA approval as a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic) or lab developed (with potentially uncertain validation standards). The Committee noted that immunohistochemistry requires subjective assessment of staining and can be assessed with inter-reader reliability to determine stability of the subjective quantitative assessment by pathologists. The Committee noted that the tests are usually developed prior to trial outcomes data being available and are optimised to laboratory-based criteria and subsequently applied to clinical studies.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that atezolizumab has two FDA approved diagnostic tests; one using the SP263 antibody, and one using the SP142 antibody. The Committee noted that the use of SP263 for lung cancer was based on IMpower010, and that this trial was underpowered to infer the utility of PD-L1 stain percentage as a predictor of disease-free survival using this assay. The Committee noted however that there was high test-retest reliability, in that, if there was a negative test, resampling would not result in a positive result.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that evidence for the use of the SP142 assay is based on the IMpower110 trial where it was reported that PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of tumour cells or ≥10 tumour infiltrating immune cells determined by the SP142 assay may be associated with enhanced overall survival with atezolizumab in NSCLC patients.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the difference between the SP142 assay and the SP263 assay may be due to the difference in evidential threshold requirements for companion versus complimentary tests, and that these tests may select for different populations.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the approved antibody for pembrolizumab is the 22C3 assay. The Committee considered that based on the BLUEPRINT study (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27913228/"" target=""_blank"">Hirsch et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2017;12:208-22</a>), the SP263 and 22C3 assays are largely interchangeable. However, the Committee noted that none of the immunohistochemistry assays have been validated with other scoring systems and that they are sensitive to the assay package which may have commercial implications for replication.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that different assays define different population sizes, with the least sensitive assay (SP142) defining the smallest population eligible for monotherapy treatment based on PD-L1 expression. The Committee noted that there was high concordance between the SP263 and 22C3 antibodies from BLUEPRINT2 (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800747/"" target=""_blank"">Taso et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2018;13:1302-11</a>), which select for larger populations and that these would likely be the antibodies used if PD-L1 testing were required for access to monotherapy.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for the efficacy and population size of atezolizumab for people with high expression of PD-L1 identified by the various antibodies would come from the evidence for the SP263 assay (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997907/"" target=""_blank"">Herbst et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;383;1328-39</a> and <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265434/"" target=""_blank"">Jassem et al. J Thorac Oncol. 2021;16:1872-82</a>). The Committee considered that the evidence for efficacy and population size of pembrolizumab would be derived from the KEYNOTE-024 trial (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33872070/"" target=""_blank"">Reck et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:2339-49</a>).</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee was not aware of any evidence that any given antibody works differently across different ethnicities and populations, or the prevalence of PD-L1 expression by ethnicity. The Committee considered that either atezolizumab or pembrolizumab would likely provide a similar benefit in first line monotherapy, but that this efficacy is derived from the population size inferred from the relevant companion diagnostic.</p><h3><em>PD-L1 testing and implications</em></h3><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the evidence for testing in these cases is tied to specific devices and instrumentation with explicit external criteria for scoring, which a lab developed test may not necessarily achieve. The Committee noted that funding an ICI treatment tied to a specific test would require testing centres to be locked into infrastructure development for that particular test. The Committee noted that although some assays may be interchangeable, the performance of validated antibodies with other scoring systems is unknown. The Committee noted that if centres do not commit to the currently validated tests, and instead developed their own or used other laboratory developed tests, then the extent to which the process has been validated would be up to the individual laboratory, which may lead to variation between centres.\xa0</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing biomarker modalities for predicting response to PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors for ten different solid tumour types (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318407/"" target=""_blank"">Lu et al. JAMA Oncol. 2019;5:1195-1204</a>). The Committee noted that when each modality was evaluated with summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, regardless of antibody used, had an area under the curve score of 0.65 (p &lt; .001). The Committee considered that this indicated that immunohistochemical testing as a predictor of response to an ICI may be limited.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis of individual-level data from 14 randomised clinical trials to investigate the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression scores on overall survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35050777/"" target=""_blank"">Arfe et al. JCO Precis Oncol. 2020;4:1196-1206</a>). The Committee considered that higher staining may not necessarily be predictive of response, but rather a slightly longer overall survival than those with low or no staining.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that current evidence supports that some antibodies used in immunohistochemistry are more sensitive than others (meaning that populations eligible for treatment would differ between tests), and that the scoring systems include different elements and have often not been cross-compared with different antibodies. The Committee also considered that the evidence supporting the scoring systems as being predictive of an individual’s response is weak but noted that by FDA and EMA regulatory standards these define treatment-eligible populations.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, generally, evidence for predictive benefit of immunohistochemical assays for ICI agents is limited, and that evidence for differing sensitivity and specificity of each antibody is of moderate to good quality. The Committee noted that less sensitive assays define smaller populations. The Committee considered that the evidence supporting the value of PD-L1 testing for clinical decision making is limited, but that this inference would benefit from the reporting of outcomes for people with high expression of PD-L1 compared to those with no expression of PD-L1 in the relevant trials. The Committee considered that the primary benefit of PD-L1 testing would occur when used in conjunction with an individual’s performance status to inform treatment decision making (ie whether or not they should receive ICI monotherapy or chemotherapy).</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2022-04-08-Cancer-Treatments-AC-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2022</a>, CTAC noted the sub-group analysis of the patient population with PD-L1 1-49% in KEYNOTE 042 indicated minimal benefit from pembrolizumab therapy and the benefit seen in the PD-L1 &gt;1% cohort was skewed by the significant benefit seen from the PD-L1 &gt;50% cohort.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in New Zealand, MedSafe does not require a specific test to be used with ICIs, simply a “validated test”, but that the language specific to each scoring system is used for each agent, which theoretically ties the ICI to its companion or complimentary diagnostic. The Committee noted that it is unclear whether or not the same holds for the identified scoring system associated with each validated test. The Committee considered that the definition of a validated test in the New Zealand context is unclear. The Committee considered that requiring infrastructure and skill development around specific testing has short term implications in terms of which ICI agents are used, but also in the long term if other ICIs are funded in future which may require a different diagnostic test.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab were funded in this setting, there would be benefit in the supplier offering access to testing in the short term but noted that this may mean that testing centres are locked into using specific testing platforms in the long term. The Committee considered it important that the validation of an in-house lab test would be derived from its ability to identify the same population as the relevant complimentary/companion diagnostics.</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there may be variable access to diagnostic biopsy procedures in New Zealand currently, primarily those with less access to tertiary hospitals, but that Pharmac’s ability to impact this inequity was limited. The Committee considered that, in addition to access to PD-L1 testing, access to diagnostic biopsy procedures (and the obtaining of sufficient tissue amounts) to enable the testing may present a barrier to accessing monotherapy. The Committee considered that, in the absence of having available tissue from biopsy, it may be appropriate to offer individuals first-line ICI monotherapy for NSCLC if they are not fit to receive combination with chemotherapy. The Committee considered that overall, approximately 10% would not be able to undergo the biopsy, and that this group would need to be accounted for in population number estimates.</p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the use of immunotherapy in individuals with EGFR or ALK activating mutations would not be evidence based. The Committee however considered that confirmation of EGFR and ALK activating mutations would be sought if possible. The Committee considered that it was uncertain of the sequence of testing if there was a small volume of tissue obtained from biopsy, however this could be confirmed with pathologists and would likely vary across the country in the absence of national alignment.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The Committee considered that given the limited infusion capacity across the country, treatment schedules and therefore dosing frequency are important and that this should be considered beyond the immediate cost attributable to this variation during evaluation.
