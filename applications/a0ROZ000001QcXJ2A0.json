The Committee also noted that while M\u0101ori who are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer have comparable one-year survival rates (42% in 2010-11) compared to non-M\u0101ori (39%), they have poorer five-year (5.4% for M\u0101ori and 11.6% for non-M\u0101ori in 2010-2011) and cumulative relative survival rates (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-patient-survival-1994-2011-apr15-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health NZ.

Sci Rep. 2018;8:4522</a>). The Committee considered this estimate to be conservative since it was higher than other available estimates. The Committee noted that for females the incidence and mortality rates were 1.7 and 1.3 per 100,000, respectively (incidence to mortality ratio 1.2). The Committee noted that, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the age standardised mortality rate for oesophageal cancer was 2.8/100,000 in 2017. The Committee noted that oesophageal cancer usually occurs in people over the age of 60, and that the five-year cumulative relative survival is 11.8%\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-patient-survival-1994-2011-apr15-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health NZ.

The Committee also noted that while M\u0101ori who are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer have comparable one-year survival rates (42% in 2010-11) compared to non-M\u0101ori (39%), they have poorer five-year (5.4% for M\u0101ori and 11.6% for non-M\u0101ori in 2010-2011) and cumulative relative survival rates (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-patient-survival-1994-2011-apr15-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health NZ.

The Committee noted that although adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is considered to be rarer than squamous cell carcinoma worldwide, the majority of oesophageal cancer registrations in New Zealand are adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32554620/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan et al. Gut. 2021. 70:234-42</a>). The Committee noted that in New Zealand, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has been reported as 4.0 per 100,000 person years for men\u00a0and 1.5 per 100,000 person years for women, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was 1.5 per 100,000 person years for men and 1.2 per 100,000 person years for women (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320104/\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold et al.

ICBP SURVMARK-2 online tool</a>). The Committee noted that data on the extent of disease at point of diagnosis in rural New Zealand, and by deprivation, is lacking.\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment for oesophageal cancer in New Zealand has remained the same for decades, and that there is a significant unmet health need for those affected. The Committee noted that the current treatment for people with oesophageal cancer (if surgery is unsuccessful or inappropriate) is usually systemic chemotherapy containing a platinum-based compound with a fluoropyrimidine; 5-FU + cisplatin and FOLFOX (5-FU, oxaliplatin and leucovorin/folinic acid), though cisplatin + capecitabine and oxaliplatin + capecitabine are also used. The Committee noted that second-line treatments include cisplatin, docetaxel, continued 5-FU, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in the New Zealand setting. The Committee noted that current therapies are considered palliative at advanced stages of disease. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that family and wh\u0101nau of individuals with oesophageal cancer are also affected, especially with regard to their emotional wellbeing in seeing their family member\u2019s health decline, and also the time and cost associated with accompanying them to chemotherapy sessions and having to regularly miss work. </p><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which binds to the PD-1 receptor on T-lymphocytes, blocking the effects of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. By blocking the PD-1 receptor, the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands are prevented from attaching, and the tumour cell is therefore exposed to the immune system. The Committee noted that the primary evidence for pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer comes from the phase III KEYNOTE-590 trial comparing pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34454674/\" target=\"_blank\">Sun et al. Lancet. 2021;398:759-71</a>). </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the participants in KEYNOTE-590 were primarily of Asian ethnicity, and that the majority of patients had squamous cell carcinoma (73%). The Committee also noted that inclusion criteria specified an ECOG performance status of 0-1, previously untreated RECIST measurable disease, and that tissue was required for PD-L1 immunohistochemical analysis (combined positive score [CPS]; 52% of squamous cell carcinoma participants had a CPS score \u226510). The Committee noted that participants were treated with either intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg three-weekly with chemotherapy (intravenous cisplatin 80\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly and 5\u2011flurouracil 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day continuous intravenous infusion on each of Days 1 to 5 three-weekly, total of 4.000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 3-week cycle) or placebo with chemotherapy. The Committee noted that participants were not stratified by PD-L1 status. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the mean treatment duration was 7.7 months for the pembrolizumab arm and 5.8 months for the chemotherapy alone arm, though there was some uncertainty in the duration individual treatment administered in each treatment arm. The Committee also noted that the median follow-up for the trial was 22.6 months.

The Committee also considered that the use of pembrolizumab in the requested setting will increase the burden on laboratory and diagnostic testing services (three-weekly full blood count, renal function, and hepatic function tests) and PD-L1 testing for both those treated and people considered for treatment (if CPS testing were included in the eligibility criteria for pembrolizumab).

The Committee also considered that those with unresectable and previously untreated stage II-III oesophageal cancer may benefit from treatment with pembrolizumab. </p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that pembrolizumab treatment may also be suitable for individuals who have had surgery, with or without neoadjuvant treatment, and then relapsed within six months. The Committee noted however that this post-surgical group was excluded from the KEYNOTE-590 trial and considered that there is not enough evidence available to evaluate the benefit of pembrolizumab for these individuals. The Committee considered that the use of pembrolizumab, or another immune checkpoint inhibitor, in the treatment of these individuals should be reconsidered in the context of the entire oesophageal carcinoma treatment landscape. </p><h3><em>Summary for Assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

The Committee noted that the current treatment for people with oesophageal cancer (if surgery is unsuccessful or inappropriate) is usually systemic chemotherapy containing a platinum-based compound with a fluoropyrimidine; 5-FU + cisplatin and FOLFOX (5-FU, oxaliplatin and leucovorin/folinic acid), though cisplatin + capecitabine and oxaliplatin + capecitabine are also used. The Committee noted that second-line treatments include cisplatin, docetaxel, continued 5-FU, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in the New Zealand setting.

By blocking the PD-1 receptor, the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands are prevented from attaching, and the tumour cell is therefore exposed to the immune system. The Committee noted that the primary evidence for pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer comes from the phase III KEYNOTE-590 trial comparing pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34454674/\" target=\"_blank\">Sun et al.

The Committee also considered that the use of pembrolizumab in the requested setting will increase the burden on laboratory and diagnostic testing services (three-weekly full blood count, renal function, and hepatic function tests) and PD-L1 testing for both those treated and people considered for treatment (if CPS testing were included in the eligibility criteria for pembrolizumab). The Committee considered that inpatient admissions for adverse events of grade 3 or above would not substantially change, given the relative rates of adverse events in the two treatment arms of KEYNOTE-590.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the uptake of pembrolizumab, if funded for the requested indication, would be upwards of 90% for individuals with good performance status. The Committee considered that, at first, there would be a small prevalent bolus of individuals diagnosed in the few months before funding who would require treatment with pembrolizumab immediately, followed by those starting treatment as incidence occurs. </p><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the results reported from KEYNOTE-590 indicate that pembrolizumab is not as effective for the treatment of adenocarcinoma as it is for squamous cell carcinoma. The Committee also noted that the proportion of adenocarcinoma in New Zealand is much higher than what was represented in the trial. </p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that KEYNOTE-590 excluded individuals who had progressed within six months of receiving prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. The Committee considered that appraisal of pembrolizumab in this context would require additional data. </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it would be appropriate for pembrolizumab to be used in the treatment of stage I oesophageal cancer which has relapsed following surgery and has not been treated with chemotherapy, as this population was included in KEYNOTE-590. The Committee also considered that those with unresectable and previously untreated stage II-III oesophageal cancer may benefit from treatment with pembrolizumab. </p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that pembrolizumab treatment may also be suitable for individuals who have had surgery, with or without neoadjuvant treatment, and then relapsed within six months. The Committee noted however that this post-surgical group was excluded from the KEYNOTE-590 trial and considered that there is not enough evidence available to evaluate the benefit of pembrolizumab for these individuals. The Committee considered that the use of pembrolizumab, or another immune checkpoint inhibitor, in the treatment of these individuals should be reconsidered in the context of the entire oesophageal carcinoma treatment landscape. </p><h3><em>Summary for Assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000PnJuP&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002lCl9\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",

The Committee also noted that while M\u0101ori who are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer have comparable one-year survival rates (42% in 2010-11) compared to non-M\u0101ori (39%), they have poorer five-year (5.4% for M\u0101ori and 11.6% for non-M\u0101ori in 2010-2011) and cumulative relative survival rates (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-patient-survival-1994-2011-apr15-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health NZ.

Sci Rep. 2018;8:4522</a>). The Committee considered this estimate to be conservative since it was higher than other available estimates. The Committee noted that for females the incidence and mortality rates were 1.7 and 1.3 per 100,000, respectively (incidence to mortality ratio 1.2). The Committee noted that, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the age standardised mortality rate for oesophageal cancer was 2.8/100,000 in 2017. The Committee noted that oesophageal cancer usually occurs in people over the age of 60, and that the five-year cumulative relative survival is 11.8%\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-patient-survival-1994-2011-apr15-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health NZ.

The Committee noted that although adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is considered to be rarer than squamous cell carcinoma worldwide, the majority of oesophageal cancer registrations in New Zealand are adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32554620/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan et al. Gut. 2021. 70:234-42</a>). The Committee noted that in New Zealand, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has been reported as 4.0 per 100,000 person years for men\u00a0and 1.5 per 100,000 person years for women, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was 1.5 per 100,000 person years for men and 1.2 per 100,000 person years for women (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320104/\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold et al.

ICBP SURVMARK-2 online tool</a>). The Committee noted that data on the extent of disease at point of diagnosis in rural New Zealand, and by deprivation, is lacking.\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment for oesophageal cancer in New Zealand has remained the same for decades, and that there is a significant unmet health need for those affected. The Committee noted that the current treatment for people with oesophageal cancer (if surgery is unsuccessful or inappropriate) is usually systemic chemotherapy containing a platinum-based compound with a fluoropyrimidine; 5-FU + cisplatin and FOLFOX (5-FU, oxaliplatin and leucovorin/folinic acid), though cisplatin + capecitabine and oxaliplatin + capecitabine are also used. The Committee noted that second-line treatments include cisplatin, docetaxel, continued 5-FU, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in the New Zealand setting. The Committee noted that current therapies are considered palliative at advanced stages of disease. </p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that family and wh\u0101nau of individuals with oesophageal cancer are also affected, especially with regard to their emotional wellbeing in seeing their family member\u2019s health decline, and also the time and cost associated with accompanying them to chemotherapy sessions and having to regularly miss work. </p><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which binds to the PD-1 receptor on T-lymphocytes, blocking the effects of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. By blocking the PD-1 receptor, the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands are prevented from attaching, and the tumour cell is therefore exposed to the immune system. The Committee noted that the primary evidence for pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer comes from the phase III KEYNOTE-590 trial comparing pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34454674/\" target=\"_blank\">Sun et al. Lancet. 2021;398:759-71</a>). </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the participants in KEYNOTE-590 were primarily of Asian ethnicity, and that the majority of patients had squamous cell carcinoma (73%). The Committee also noted that inclusion criteria specified an ECOG performance status of 0-1, previously untreated RECIST measurable disease, and that tissue was required for PD-L1 immunohistochemical analysis (combined positive score [CPS]; 52% of squamous cell carcinoma participants had a CPS score \u226510). The Committee noted that participants were treated with either intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg three-weekly with chemotherapy (intravenous cisplatin 80\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly and 5\u2011flurouracil 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day continuous intravenous infusion on each of Days 1 to 5 three-weekly, total of 4.000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 3-week cycle) or placebo with chemotherapy. The Committee noted that participants were not stratified by PD-L1 status. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the mean treatment duration was 7.7 months for the pembrolizumab arm and 5.8 months for the chemotherapy alone arm, though there was some uncertainty in the duration individual treatment administered in each treatment arm. The Committee also noted that the median follow-up for the trial was 22.6 months. The Committee noted that overall survival for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with a CPS score of \u226510 at 22.6 months was 31% in the pembrolizumab arm versus 15% in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; p&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted that the overall survival for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma regardless of CPS was 29% for the pembrolizumab arm versus 17% for the placebo arm (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88; p=0.0006); and that the overall survival for all participants (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) with a CPS of \u226510 was 31% in the pembrolizumab arm and 15% in the placebo arm (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; p&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted that for all of the trial participants, regardless of tumour type or CPS score, overall survival was 28% in the pembrolizumab arm and 16% in the placebo arm (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median overall survival for patients with PD-L1 CPS &lt;10% was 10.5 months in the pembrolizumab arm versus 10.6 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.1). The Committee also noted the results from an unplanned post-hoc analysis of patients with adenocarcinoma, which was underpowered to detect statistical significance. This analysis showed no statistically significant difference between treatment arms (HR for overall survival 0.74; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.02). The Committee considered that this may be due to adenocarcinomas usually not expressing PD-L1 highly. The Committee noted that there were no new adverse event indications for pembrolizumab that have not already been noted for other indications. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the KEYNOTE-590 trial was of good quality and strength. The Committee considered, however, that the trial population (predominantly of Asian ethnicity and with squamous cell carcinoma) does not necessarily reflect the New Zealand affected population. The Committee also considered that performance status in the trial (ECOG 0-1) would not necessarily represent those in New Zealand with unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer which is a high burden disease. The Committee considered that in the New Zealand context, individuals so affected are likely to have worse performance status at this disease stage. The Committee also considered that it would not be appropriate in this context to consider giving a five-day continuous infusion of 5-FU in an inpatient setting, as this would not be suitable or safe for those with advanced disease. The Committee agreed that it would be necessary to seek further information about the current treatment landscape in New Zealand which would form the best treatment to recommend for funding and the nature of the \u2018chemotherapy backbone\u2019 of the proposed treatment, before proceeding with an economic assessment of the proposal.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following evidence relating to other PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of oesophageal cancer: </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.14.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>CheckMate649 (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02872116?term=checkmate+649&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02872116</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">); </u><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34102137/\" target=\"_blank\">Janjigian et al.

The Committee also considered that the use of pembrolizumab in the requested setting will increase the burden on laboratory and diagnostic testing services (three-weekly full blood count, renal function, and hepatic function tests) and PD-L1 testing for both those treated and people considered for treatment (if CPS testing were included in the eligibility criteria for pembrolizumab). The Committee considered that inpatient admissions for adverse events of grade 3 or above would not substantially change, given the relative rates of adverse events in the two treatment arms of KEYNOTE-590.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the uptake of pembrolizumab, if funded for the requested indication, would be upwards of 90% for individuals with good performance status. The Committee considered that, at first, there would be a small prevalent bolus of individuals diagnosed in the few months before funding who would require treatment with pembrolizumab immediately, followed by those starting treatment as incidence occurs. </p><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the results reported from KEYNOTE-590 indicate that pembrolizumab is not as effective for the treatment of adenocarcinoma as it is for squamous cell carcinoma. The Committee also noted that the proportion of adenocarcinoma in New Zealand is much higher than what was represented in the trial. </p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that KEYNOTE-590 excluded individuals who had progressed within six months of receiving prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. The Committee considered that appraisal of pembrolizumab in this context would require additional data. </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it would be appropriate for pembrolizumab to be used in the treatment of stage I oesophageal cancer which has relapsed following surgery and has not been treated with chemotherapy, as this population was included in KEYNOTE-590. The Committee also considered that those with unresectable and previously untreated stage II-III oesophageal cancer may benefit from treatment with pembrolizumab. </p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that pembrolizumab treatment may also be suitable for individuals who have had surgery, with or without neoadjuvant treatment, and then relapsed within six months. The Committee noted however that this post-surgical group was excluded from the KEYNOTE-590 trial and considered that there is not enough evidence available to evaluate the benefit of pembrolizumab for these individuals. The Committee considered that the use of pembrolizumab, or another immune checkpoint inhibitor, in the treatment of these individuals should be reconsidered in the context of the entire oesophageal carcinoma treatment landscape. </p><h3><em>Summary for Assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000PnJuP&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002lCl9\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
