The Committee considered that zonisamide would likely, through reducing seizures, produce health benefit for not only the patient, but also for family, whānau and wider society by reducing family burden of care, depression and anxiety, and may improve ability to work. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant proposed that if Special Authority criteria were required, that criteria similar to lacosamide may be appropriate.\xa0The Committee noted that this would place zonisamide as a sixth-line treatment option. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, with advancing more refractory disease, the later in the treatment paradigm an epilepsy medicine is, the less efficacious it is likely to be for people with refractory epilepsy, and therefore considered that it would be preferable for zonisamide to be an available option earlier than sixth line. The Committee acknowledged that zonisamide may be more expensive than alternative anti-epilepsy drugs, and that any funding criteria implemented would likely be for fiscal management. The Committee considered that any Special Authority criteria for zonisamide should be on the advice of a specialist neurologist, general physician or paediatrician. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that this proposal would not clearly result in any substantial additional costs or savings to the health system. Members considered that if zonisamide were to reduce the number of seizures, even if less than the 50% seizure reduction used in clinical trials as the key outcome measured, particularly in children, the clinical impacts would be considerable including reduction in seizure-related hospitalisations. \xa0This may reduce hospital related costs. Members considered the needs, especially of children with treatment-resistant severe frequent seizures, to be very high, with any appreciable decrease in seizure frequency or severity having major benefits for patients and their caregivers/family/whānau.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that if zonisamide were listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule that more patients would likely be treated with zonisamide, compared to those currently receiving zonisamide through the NPPA pathway. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that for the purposes of either economic modelling or consideration of individuals with exceptional refractory disease under the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) scheme, regardless of treatment (either zonisamide or any other epilepsy treatments), PHARMAC staff could seek advice from the Neurological Subcommittee regarding baseline seizure rates in these patient groups in New Zealand (noting the large variability on this in the literature) in order to assess the appropriateness of a 50% reduction in seizures and whether lesser reductions could still provide clinically meaningful improvements for these patients with very high need.

in particular, advice regarding:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>baseline seizure rates in the recommended patient groups in New Zealand to assess the appropriateness of a 50% reduction in seizures (noting the large variability on this in the literature),</li><li>whether lesser seizure reductions could still provide clinically meaningful improvements for these patients with very high need, and</li><li>the total expected number of patients who would be expected to use zonisamide and which pharmaceuticals zonisamide would be used in combination with</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee considered that there was no recent data readily available to inform the average baseline seizure rates in individuals with refractory partial epilepsy requiring monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, or in severe childhood epilepsy syndromes including LGS and similar epileptic encephalopathies. Members considered that a large community-based epilepsy cohort study conducted in the UK may provide some data regarding seizure rates in a comparable population (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.42.10.1911"" target=""_blank"">Manford et al. Neurology. 1992;42:1911-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that clinical trials predominantly have previously used one seizure per week as a threshold for trial eligibility and considered that this has carried forward as an informal standard for severity given even one or two seizures can significantly affect an individual (eg from the impact of this on ability to work or drive). The Subcommittee considered that patients with severe childhood epilepsy syndromes may experience several seizures per week consisting of several types (eg tonic-atonic, myoclonic, complex partial, atypical absence and generalised tonic-clonic seizures). The Subcommittee considered that in practice, it can be challenging to accurately identify the baseline seizure rate in an individual with epilepsy from which to subsequently assess treatment response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that a reduction in seizures would correlate to a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of complications or death due to fewer seizures. However, the Subcommittee considered that even with a 50% reduction in seizures the occurrence of a single seizure can have serious consequences for a person with epilepsy and therefore the majority of patients would be unlikely to attain a significant change in quality of life (QoL), although a small number of patients with mild epilepsy might experience a change in QoL due to the ability to work and/or drive.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that a 50% reduction in seizures from baseline was an outcome used in clinical trials to define a response to active treatment, as opposed to a placebo response which is reported to attain up to a 25-30% reduction in seizure frequencies in epilepsy trials. The Subcommittee therefore considered that a threshold of 30% reduction in seizures from baseline may also capture patients experiencing a placebo response and would not be appropriate to use for funding criteria renewal for zonisamide on a population level. The Subcommittee considered that in rare cases patients may attain clinically relevant reductions in seizure severity or duration, move to a less severe seizure type (eg from complex partial seizures to simple partial seizures), or experience other clinically meaningful improvements (eg in patient/carer global impression) that may align with the intent of the significant improvement according to a 50% reduction in seizures, and considered that such patients could be appropriately considered case-by-case for treatment renewal. Overall, the Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate for funding criteria for zonisamide to require a significant and sustained benefit in order to access renewal, with a 50% reduction in seizures from baseline used as a guide.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that zonisamide is an oral sulfonamide derivative with minimal carbonic-anhydrase effect. The Subcommittee noted that zonisamide blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive T-type calcium currents without affecting L-type calcium currents) and it has a modulatory effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neuronal inhibition. The Subcommittee considered that these multiple mechanisms of action may help explain the efficacy of zonisamide in epilepsy that is refractory to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including other sodium channel blockers.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">Partial</span> epilepsy</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted PTAC’s appraisal of the evidence for zonisamide in its <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf"" target=""_blank"">September 2020</a> record, including a Cochrane review summarising evidence of efficacy of zonisamide (vs carbamazepine and vs lamotrigine) in partial seizures (<a href=""https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011412.pub3/full"" target=""_blank"">Nevitt et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017;12:CD011412</a>) and considered the evidence supported the use of zonisamide in partial epilepsy.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that fourth-line use of zonisamide for partial epilepsy would be expected to reduce seizure frequency and/or severity for a proportion of patients with refractory epilepsy due to its different mechanisms of action to those of funded AEDs. The Subcommittee considered that funding a treatment with a different mechanism of action would be particularly useful for patients who are not receiving sufficient benefit on current funded treatments; noting the refractory disease state of patients who have trialled and received insufficient benefit from several AEDs differs from that of less pre-treated patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 4,500 patients might access zonisamide as a fourth-line treatment, based on an epilepsy prevalence of 1% in New Zealand, two-thirds of whom would likely have\xa0partial onset seizures. Of that proportion, about 30% would be refractory and a further 50% of those would have received insufficient benefit from at least three other funded AEDs. The Subcommittee considered that about 10-20% of those trialling zonisamide (about 540 patients) might use it long-term based on 1.17% of patients gaining seizure freedom from a fourth-line AED after one year, as reported in the real-world study by Chen et al. (<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2666189"" target=""_blank"">Chen et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018;75:279-86</a>). The Subcommittee considered that about half of the 540 patients who might receive zonisamide long-term would otherwise have been prescribed lacosamide. The Subcommittee considered therefore that about 4,000 people with partial epilepsy would trial zonisamide for approximately six months but would be expected to subsequently discontinue zonisamide due to insufficient benefit. The Subcommittee considered that uptake of fourth-line zonisamide would be gradual and that patients would have used levetiracetam, lamotrigine and one other AED (eg carbamazepine or sodium valproate) prior.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if zonisamide were funded for all patients with partial epilepsy, it would most likely be used in place of topiramate within the treatment paradigm. However, the Subcommittee considered that zonisamide could be used as an adjunctive treatment for partial epilepsy in combination with the following AEDs: topiramate in about 10% of cases requiring adjunctive treatment; carbamazepine in about 15%; and lamotrigine and levetiracetam in about 30%, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if zonisamide were funded as a sixth-line treatment for partial epilepsy<b> </b>alongside<b> </b>lacosamide in the treatment paradigm, preferential use of lacosamide would likely continue due to clinician familiarity (noting its comparable efficacy and toxicity to that of zonisamide). Members considered that lacosamide and zonisamide demonstrated similar benefit and safety for partial epilespy. However, the Subcommittee considered that zonisamide’s different mechanism of action to lacosamide (and other funded AEDs) would be of benefit for some patients and was an important point of difference. The Subcommittee considered that, if an adequate response was not achieved or intolerable side effects resulted from sixth-line lacosamide, zonisamide would likely be trialled (and vice versa, if initiated in the opposite sequence).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding zonisamide in the fourth-line setting would be more clinically appropriate than in the sixth-line setting which would require prior treatment with more funded AEDs. The Subcommittee therefore considered that the following Special Authority criteria could target funding to patients with refractory partial epilepsy:</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><b style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Zonisamide (partial onset epilepsy).
