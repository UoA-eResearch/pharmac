The Committee noted that recent changes to ADHD diagnosis (either inattention or hyperactivity, as opposed to both) have led to an increased prevalence worldwide. The Committee noted that the prevalence of ADHD in New Zealand is widely believed to be approximately one in 20 children and one in 25 adults (<a href=""https://www.adhd.org.nz/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20ADHD%20New%20Zealand&amp;text=You%20may%20also%20know%20that,20%20New%20Zealanders%20have%20ADHD."" target=""_blank"">ADHD New Zealand</a>).

The Committee noted that these agents are usually effective in treating individuals with ADHD and that they should not be prescribed without wrap-around care, though this commonly happens. The Committee noted that most trials providing evidence for efficacy of dexamfetamine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine were conducted with participants with ADHD with a tighter diagnosis than the DSM-5 criteria (ie inattention AND hyperactivity), and were provided wrap-around care. The Committee noted that for some people, stimulants do not provide an adequate effect, or are associated with intolerable side-effects.

The Committee therefore considered that diagnosis should be re-confirmed by a specialist prior to commencement of treatment with DEN and at the point of renewal. The Committee considered that following confirmation of diagnosis, treatment with DEN could be managed at the primary care level, which is especially beneficial within the context of the lack of available secondary care support. </p><h2><strong><em>Costs and Savings </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it was reasonable to assume an uptake rate of 60% for DEN among the eligible population due to the health need associated with ADHD that cannot be managed adequately with currently funded medications, as well as a range of factors that may affect peoples’ willingness to trial DEN including the large number of daily capsules.

The Committee noted that recent changes to ADHD diagnosis (either inattention or hyperactivity, as opposed to both) have led to an increased prevalence worldwide. The Committee noted that the prevalence of ADHD in New Zealand is widely believed to be approximately one in 20 children and one in 25 adults (<a href=""https://www.adhd.org.nz/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20ADHD%20New%20Zealand&amp;text=You%20may%20also%20know%20that,20%20New%20Zealanders%20have%20ADHD."" target=""_blank"">ADHD New Zealand</a>).

The Committee noted that these agents are usually effective in treating individuals with ADHD and that they should not be prescribed without wrap-around care, though this commonly happens. The Committee noted that most trials providing evidence for efficacy of dexamfetamine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine were conducted with participants with ADHD with a tighter diagnosis than the DSM-5 criteria (ie inattention AND hyperactivity), and were provided wrap-around care. The Committee noted that for some people, stimulants do not provide an adequate effect, or are associated with intolerable side-effects.

The Committee therefore considered that diagnosis should be re-confirmed by a specialist prior to commencement of treatment with DEN and at the point of renewal. The Committee considered that following confirmation of diagnosis, treatment with DEN could be managed at the primary care level, which is especially beneficial within the context of the lack of available secondary care support. </p><h2><strong><em>Costs and Savings </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it was reasonable to assume an uptake rate of 60% for DEN among the eligible population due to the health need associated with ADHD that cannot be managed adequately with currently funded medications, as well as a range of factors that may affect peoples’ willingness to trial DEN including the large number of daily capsules. The Committee considered that the relatively small participation among the trials of DEN conducted in New Zealand were indicative of likely uptake patterns of DEN in a local context. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was no published or anecdotal evidence to suggest that treatment of ADHD with DEN would impact rates of inpatient hospitalisation. </p><h2><strong><em>Summary for assessment </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for DEN if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of ADHD.

The Committee noted that most trials providing evidence for efficacy of dexamfetamine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine were conducted with participants with ADHD with a tighter diagnosis than the DSM-5 criteria (ie inattention AND hyperactivity), and were provided wrap-around care.

The Committee noted that treatment with DEN showed an overall improvement in CGI scores which were maintained out to one year, but that there was mixed evidence relating to ADHD specific improvements. The Committee noted that there were no side effects reported out to one year of treatment with high doses of micronutrients but considered that longer follow-up would be needed to truly evaluate this.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that DEN would be best placed in the treatment paradigm post stimulants as that is where the greatest unmet health need exists. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.19.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a number of personal testimonials submitted with the application, many describing lived experience of people with ADHD in New Zealand and the high positive impact with DEN. The Committee noted that cost was reported as a large barrier to individuals with ADHD and their families accessing DEN. </p><h2><strong><em>Suitability </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that people would be required to ingest up to 15 DEN tablets over three divided doses a day and considered that this may be challenging for some, especially children, however acknowledged the applicant’s noting that special cups and training on pill swallowing are available, as well as an alternative powder form of DEN. The Committee noted that once a child was enrolled in the applicant’s clinical research, it was reported that adherence to the three times daily dosing schedule was not an issue and considered this was evident in the trial results.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the Darling et al. (2018) trial recruited only 93 of the target 100 participants for their study and considered that this may indicate that DEN may not be a popular a treatment option amongst all patients who discontinue stimulant treatment.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that unlike stimulant medications, there is no risk of diversion (the transfer of any legally prescribed controlled substance from the individual for whom it was prescribed to another person for any illicit use) with DEN.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the size of the eligible population for DEN was growing due to increases in the prevalence of diagnosed ADHD over time. The Committee considered that data on the number of people who have trialled funded stimulants and atomoxetine could provide a reasonable estimate of this population.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that although patients in the requested indication would have already been diagnosed with ADHD, regular review is important as approximately 2% of patients become asymptomatic annually. The Committee therefore considered that diagnosis should be re-confirmed by a specialist prior to commencement of treatment with DEN and at the point of renewal. The Committee considered that following confirmation of diagnosis, treatment with DEN could be managed at the primary care level, which is especially beneficial within the context of the lack of available secondary care support. </p><h2><strong><em>Costs and Savings </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it was reasonable to assume an uptake rate of 60% for DEN among the eligible population due to the health need associated with ADHD that cannot be managed adequately with currently funded medications, as well as a range of factors that may affect peoples’ willingness to trial DEN including the large number of daily capsules. The Committee considered that the relatively small participation among the trials of DEN conducted in New Zealand were indicative of likely uptake patterns of DEN in a local context. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was no published or anecdotal evidence to suggest that treatment of ADHD with DEN would impact rates of inpatient hospitalisation. </p><h2><strong><em>Summary for assessment </em></strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for DEN if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of ADHD.

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
