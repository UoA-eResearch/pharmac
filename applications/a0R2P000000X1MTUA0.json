The Subcommittee noted that a number of Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) applications have been received by PHARMAC, and that the patient group approved was previously defined as those with an urgent requirement for an immunosuppressive agent, or where all funded alternative treatments had been trialled and had not provided adequate disease control. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 expressing B-lymphocytes currently funded for the treatment of a number of haematology and rheumatology disorders such as Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and Wegner\u2019s granulomatosis. The Subcommittee noted that rituximab is administered by infusion with different treatment schedules depending on if an oncological or rheumatological protocol is needed. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pemphigus is a group of chronic, autoimmune skin diseases which are characterised by acantholysis, resulting in the formation of intraepithelial blisters in mucous membranes and skin caused by autoantibodies against desmosomes in the epidermis leading to erosions. The Subcommittee noted that the process of acantholysis is induced by the binding of circulating autoantibodies to intercellular adhesion molecules. The Subcommittee noted that there are several subtypes of pemphigus including vulgaris, foliaceus, vegetans, paraneoplastic, and IgA; the most common of which are vulgaris and foliaceus which form approximately 95% of diagnoses globally. The Subcommittee noted there is limited data on incidence and prevalence of pemphigus in New Zealand but noted pemphigus vulgaris is the more common subtype overseas.\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the health need for patients with pemphigus is high, with common symptoms being widespread skin blisters, erosions and mucosal loss (commonly intractable oral ulceration), and direct disease complications due to skin failure from extensive skin loss and mucosal involvement including pain, secondary systemic infection, secondary cutaneous infection (both bacterial and viral), fluid loss and inability to eat due to oral involvement. The Subcommittee noted that the average age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years and more common in females. The Subcommittee noted that incidence globally is estimated to be 0.6 to 10 per million, with some populations experiencing higher rates; Jewish populations experience prevalence as high as 32 per million, and 3-5% of the South American population suffers from an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus. The Subcommittee noted that pemphigus may disproportionately affect the New Zealand Indian community, which may explain the higher prevalence of pemphigus in the Auckland region.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the various scoring systems for pemphigus, and dermatology disease in general; the autoimmune bullous skin disorder intensity score (ABSIS), the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI), the physician\u2019s global assessment (PGA), the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). The Subcommittee noted that these systems are used to measure the extent of disease, the degree of healing, lesion counts, and circulating antibody levels. The Subcommittee noted that values for defining moderate, significant, and extensive types of pemphigus are derived from the ABSIS and PDAI systems primarily (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27484271/\" target=\"_blank\">Boulard et al. Br J Dermatol. 2016;175:18-19</a>). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, prior to the use of glucocorticoids, 75-90% of patients with pemphigus would die as a result of their pemphigus. The Subcommittee noted that the estimated mortality rate with current treatments is less than 5-10%, which is still 2-4 times higher than that of the general population. The Subcommittee noted that primary causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with pemphigus are infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which are all more common in pemphigus patients.

The Subcommittee noted that rituximab is administered by infusion with different treatment schedules depending on if an oncological or rheumatological protocol is needed. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pemphigus is a group of chronic, autoimmune skin diseases which are characterised by acantholysis, resulting in the formation of intraepithelial blisters in mucous membranes and skin caused by autoantibodies against desmosomes in the epidermis leading to erosions. The Subcommittee noted that the process of acantholysis is induced by the binding of circulating autoantibodies to intercellular adhesion molecules. The Subcommittee noted that there are several subtypes of pemphigus including vulgaris, foliaceus, vegetans, paraneoplastic, and IgA; the most common of which are vulgaris and foliaceus which form approximately 95% of diagnoses globally. The Subcommittee noted there is limited data on incidence and prevalence of pemphigus in New Zealand but noted pemphigus vulgaris is the more common subtype overseas.\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the health need for patients with pemphigus is high, with common symptoms being widespread skin blisters, erosions and mucosal loss (commonly intractable oral ulceration), and direct disease complications due to skin failure from extensive skin loss and mucosal involvement including pain, secondary systemic infection, secondary cutaneous infection (both bacterial and viral), fluid loss and inability to eat due to oral involvement. The Subcommittee noted that the average age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years and more common in females. The Subcommittee noted that incidence globally is estimated to be 0.6 to 10 per million, with some populations experiencing higher rates; Jewish populations experience prevalence as high as 32 per million, and 3-5% of the South American population suffers from an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus. The Subcommittee noted that pemphigus may disproportionately affect the New Zealand Indian community, which may explain the higher prevalence of pemphigus in the Auckland region.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the various scoring systems for pemphigus, and dermatology disease in general; the autoimmune bullous skin disorder intensity score (ABSIS), the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI), the physician\u2019s global assessment (PGA), the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). The Subcommittee noted that these systems are used to measure the extent of disease, the degree of healing, lesion counts, and circulating antibody levels. The Subcommittee noted that values for defining moderate, significant, and extensive types of pemphigus are derived from the ABSIS and PDAI systems primarily (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27484271/\" target=\"_blank\">Boulard et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the estimated mortality rate with current treatments is less than 5-10%, which is still 2-4 times higher than that of the general population. The Subcommittee noted that primary causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with pemphigus are infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which are all more common in pemphigus patients. The Subcommittee noted that treatment related adverse events also contribute to the increased mortality and morbidity of pemphigus patients, and that patients also experience psychological effects; depression and anxiety are common, experienced by approximately 77% of patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21967321/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghodsi et al. J Dermatol. 2012;39:141-144</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients with severe disease are often unable to work, and that hospitalisation for severe disease is common and can last many weeks while waiting for the skin to heal. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current treatment paradigm for pemphigus is glucocorticoids in the first line, usually oral prednisone at 0.5-2 mg per kg per day, which continues until the patients experiences for at least two weeks with no new blisters, and with clinical resolution of most of the erosions, at which point treatment is slowly tapered to prevent relapse. The Subcommittee noted that 52-76% of patients achieve disease control on less than 10 mg per day of prednisone at 12 months, and that relapse occurs in about 50% of patients. The Subcommittee noted that the negative side-effect profile of long-term prednisone treatment is well documented. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that adjuvant treatments are also used in the management of pemphigus; azathioprine, mycophenolate, intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and immunoadsorption are all treatment options to reduce steroid requirement and prevent relapse. The Subcommittee were made aware of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the role of adjuvant therapy in pemphigus (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26088689/\" target=\"_blank\">Atzmony et al. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2015;73:264-271</a>). The Subcommittee noted that although adjuvants were not beneficial for achieving remission, they were found to collectively decrease the risk of relapse by 29% (relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.95).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised trial (Ritux 3 trial, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03790293) in which 90 patients aged 18-80 years with newly diagnosed pemphigus (i.e. Being treated for the first time) were randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive either oral prednisone alone, 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg/day tapered over 12 or 18 months (n=44), or 1000 mg of intravenous rituximab on days 0 and 14, and 500 mg at months 12 and 18, combined with a short-term prednisone regimen, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day tapered over 3 or 6 months (n=46) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28342637/\" target=\"_blank\">Joly et al. Lancet. 2017;389:2031-2040</a>). The Subcommittee noted that 82% of patients had pemphigus vulgaris and 18% had pemphigus foliaceus. The Subcommittee noted that in the prednisone alone group, 12 participants withdrew (8 due to side-effects and 4 due to treatment failure), and that 2 participants withdrew from the rituximab group (1 due to pregnancy, and the other due to treatment failure). The Subcommittee noted that complete remission off therapy (no lesions, and off steroids for 2 months) at 24 months occurred in 34% of the prednisone group and 89% of the rituximab group (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.71 to 3.99; p&lt;0.0001). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that relapse at 24 months occurred in 45% of the prednisone group and 24% of the rituximab group. The Subcommittee also noted that after adjusting for sex or baseline PDAI score, a strong beneficial effect of rituximab was still evident with an RR of complete remission off-therapy of 2.66 (95% CI 1.73 to 4.07; P&lt;0.0001) and 2.55 (1.41 to 3.69; p&lt;0.0001), respectively. The Subcommittee noted that five patients (11%) in the rituximab group and 28 patients (64%) in the prednisone group still had active lesions at month 24 or had no lesions but still took a prednisone dose higher than 10 mg/day (RR 2.45; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.67; p&lt;0.0001).\u00a0The Subcommittee noted that the median time to complete remission off therapy was 277 days in the rituximab group vs 677 days in the prednisone group, and the total cumulative steroid dose was lower in the rituximab group compared to the prednisone group (6143 mg vs 17,973 mg, respectively). The Subcommittee also noted that 16 participants in the rituximab treatment group experienced a total of 27 severe adverse events (mean 0.59), whereas 29 patients experienced a total of 53 severe events (mean 1.20) in the prednisone treatment group (p=0.0021). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee were made aware of a review on the results from the Ritux 3 trial regarding use of rituximab in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris specifically (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838645/\" target=\"_blank\">Frampton JE. Am J Clin Dermatol. 2020;21:149-156</a>).
