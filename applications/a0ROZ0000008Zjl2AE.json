The Committee considered that its November 2015 recommendation, of low priority, for funding eplerenone for patients with heart failure who are intolerant to optimal dosing of spironolactone should remain. However, members considered that the degree of heart failure should be quantified, and that this recommendation should be for patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than 40%.",
