The Subcommittee considered that these innovations were transformative for patients and their support networks, substantially reducing the level of user-engagement and burden associated with managing type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the MiniMed 780G system is Bluetooth enabled, sending the patients device and CGM data every 5 minutes to a cloud-based software program called Carelink via the patient’s smartphone.

The Subcommittee noted that the system works similarly to the Guardian 3, however, does not need fingerstick calibration or diabetes treatment decisions. The Subcommittee considered that the Guardian 4 would be a suitable stand-alone CGM system along with the Dexcom G6 and could be paired with the funded MiniMed 770G in HCL system.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the insulin pumps can be used in Manual Mode with interaction by the patient or in Auto Mode with the pump automatically responding to CGM readings.
