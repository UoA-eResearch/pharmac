The Subcommittee noted that there are 3000 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed each year in New Zealand and that approximately 20% of individuals present with metastatic disease. The Subcommittee noted that data from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program indicating mCRC 5-year survival of 14%. The Subcommittee noted that Māori and Pacific Peoples are diagnosed at younger ages, are more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and are more likely to have left-sided colorectal cancer (<a href=""http://www.hrc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/THE%20PIPER%20PROJECT%20Final%20deliverable%20report%207%20August%202015%20%28HRC%2011_764%20FINDLAY%29.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Jackson et al. The PIPER project final report. 2015</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the left and right side of the colon are derived from different embryologic origins, and that left- and right-sided colorectal cancers exhibit differences in incidence, pathogenesis, genetic and molecular signatures, and immunological profile. The Subcommittee noted that primary tumour location, or ‘sidedness’ has been recognised as a prognostic factor in mCRC for some time, but that it has only recently been suggested that ‘sidedness’ may also be predictive of response to treatment (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27907852"" target=""_blank"">Holch et al. Eur J Cancer. 2017;70:87-98)</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that mutations in EGFR, RAS, and BRAF are widely accepted as prognostic and predictive markers in colorectal cancer. The Subcommittee considered that testing for EGFR is not normally conducted in New Zealand as it is assumed that most patients with CRC overexpress EGFR. The Subcommittee considered that access to RAS and BRAF testing in New Zealand is highly variable depending on region and that should eligibility for funding be determined in part by the presence or absence or mutations it would be important for this to be accompanied by an equitable approach to access to mutation testing across the country.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with mCRC for whom surgery is not adequate or appropriate. The Subcommittee noted that single-agent chemotherapies used for mCRC include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil and combination regimens include FOLFIRI (leucovorin + 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan), FOLFOX (leucovorin + 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin), and XELOX (capecitabine + oxaliplatin).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the treatment paradigm suggested by the Gastrointestinal Tumour Specialist Interest Group and the applications being reviewed propose that cetuximab plus chemotherapy should be used for the first-line treatment of RAS wild-type, left-sided mCRC; bevacizumab plus chemotherapy should be used for the first-line treatment of RAS wild-type, right-sided mCRC and first-line treatment for all RAS mutant mCRC; and bevacizumab plus chemotherapy should be used for the second line treatment of all mCRC.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Cetuximab</u></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that prevents the binding of endogenous ligands to EGFR, resulting in the internalisation and down-regulation of the receptor. The Subcommittee considered that the involvement of the EGFR signalling pathway in the development of malignancies such as CRC has been extensively documented.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, RAS wild-type mCRC and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab is funded for the treatment of locally advanced, non-metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in patients contraindicated or intolerant to cisplatin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the randomised, open-label, Phase 3 CRYSTAL trial that investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone for the first-line treatment of 599 individuals with EGFR-positive mCRC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339720"" target=""_blank"">van Cutsem et al. N Engl. J Med. 2009;360:1408-17</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of approximately 30 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) in the primary analysis population was 8.9 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with 8.0 months with FOLFIRI alone (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048) and the overall survival [OS] was 19.9 months vs 18.6 months (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; P=0.31). The Subcommittee noted that in KRAS wild-type patients, the PFS was 9.9 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with 8.7 months with FOLFIRI alone (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94; P=0.02) and the OS was 24.9 months vs 21.0 months (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a retrospective analysis of the phase 3 CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials that investigated the prognostic and predictive value of primary tumour location in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC treatment with first-line cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722750"" target=""_blank"">Tejpar et al.

Acta Oncol. 2014;53:852-64</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the study concluded that mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and non-functional PTEN predicted resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. The Subcommittee considered that this should be taken into account when considering potential criteria for access to cetuximab, if it were to be funded.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the safety profile for cetuximab is manageable, but that it is associated with significant skin toxicities such as acneiform rash that often require treatment (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339720"" target=""_blank"">van Cutsem et al.

The Subcommittee noted that these studies generally indicated that cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy does not have a substantial impact on quality of life, provided skin reactions were adequately managed.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if cetuximab were to be funded, there would be costs associated with administration (weekly or depending of clinician comfort fortnightly infusion) and the management of adverse events.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if cetuximab were funded for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC, that only 30% of individuals would be fit enough and eligible for treatment. The Subcommittee considered that this would be approximately 70 patients per year.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although the data for the use of cetuximab in left-sided mCRC is largely from post hoc analyses, that the signal of a benefit is consistent. The Subcommittee further considered that it is unlikely that prospective trials powered to investigate the use of anti-EGFR therapies in left vs right-sided mCRC will be conducted. The Subcommittee considered that the body of evidence available to date indicates that cetuximab provides a moderate survival benefit for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC with manageable toxicity and no significant effect on quality of life.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><u>Bevacizumab</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cells, resulting in reduced tumour angiogenesis. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""><span class=""ql-cursor"">\ufeff</span>\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of mCRC; advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer; advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; metastatic breast cancer; relapsed high-grade malignant glioma; epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; and cervical cancer. The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is not currently funded for use in any cancer indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the additive effect of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of mCRC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476731"" target=""_blank"">Baraniskin et al. Eur J Cancer. 2019;106:37-44</a>). The Subcommittee noted that overall, the analysis of PFS and OS favoured bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit was more pronounced when bevacizumab was combined with fluoropyrimidine monotherapy compared with combination therapies such as 5-FU plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The Subcommittee also considered that the studies included were relatively old and most were only powered to detect a PFS benefit. Members considered that bevacizumab likely provides more of a benefit when used in combination with less effective chemotherapy regimens, but that the standard of care combinations in New Zealand (FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, CAPOX) are relatively effective. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted an analysis of an observational cohort study (BRiTE) that investigated the association between various pre- and post-treatment factors and survival in patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab beyond first-line (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18854571"" target=""_blank"">Grothey et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the involvement of the EGFR signalling pathway in the development of malignancies such as CRC has been extensively documented.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, RAS wild-type mCRC and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that cetuximab is funded for the treatment of locally advanced, non-metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in patients contraindicated or intolerant to cisplatin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the randomised, open-label, Phase 3 CRYSTAL trial that investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone for the first-line treatment of 599 individuals with EGFR-positive mCRC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339720"" target=""_blank"">van Cutsem et al. N Engl. J Med. 2009;360:1408-17</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow-up of approximately 30 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) in the primary analysis population was 8.9 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with 8.0 months with FOLFIRI alone (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99; P=0.048) and the overall survival [OS] was 19.9 months vs 18.6 months (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; P=0.31). The Subcommittee noted that in KRAS wild-type patients, the PFS was 9.9 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with 8.7 months with FOLFIRI alone (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94; P=0.02) and the OS was 24.9 months vs 21.0 months (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a retrospective analysis of the phase 3 CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials that investigated the prognostic and predictive value of primary tumour location in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC treatment with first-line cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722750"" target=""_blank"">Tejpar et al. JAMA Oncol. 2017;3:194-201</a>).

Acta Oncol. 2014;53:852-64</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the study concluded that mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and non-functional PTEN predicted resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. The Subcommittee considered that this should be taken into account when considering potential criteria for access to cetuximab, if it were to be funded.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the safety profile for cetuximab is manageable, but that it is associated with significant skin toxicities such as acneiform rash that often require treatment (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339720"" target=""_blank"">van Cutsem et al.

The Subcommittee noted that these studies generally indicated that cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy does not have a substantial impact on quality of life, provided skin reactions were adequately managed.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if cetuximab were to be funded, there would be costs associated with administration (weekly or depending of clinician comfort fortnightly infusion) and the management of adverse events.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if cetuximab were funded for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC, that only 30% of individuals would be fit enough and eligible for treatment. The Subcommittee considered that this would be approximately 70 patients per year.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although the data for the use of cetuximab in left-sided mCRC is largely from post hoc analyses, that the signal of a benefit is consistent. The Subcommittee further considered that it is unlikely that prospective trials powered to investigate the use of anti-EGFR therapies in left vs right-sided mCRC will be conducted. The Subcommittee considered that the body of evidence available to date indicates that cetuximab provides a moderate survival benefit for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC with manageable toxicity and no significant effect on quality of life.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><u>Bevacizumab</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cells, resulting in reduced tumour angiogenesis. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;""><span class=""ql-cursor"">\ufeff</span>\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is approved by Medsafe for the treatment of mCRC; advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer; advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; metastatic breast cancer; relapsed high-grade malignant glioma; epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; and cervical cancer. The Subcommittee noted that bevacizumab is not currently funded for use in any cancer indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the additive effect of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of mCRC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476731"" target=""_blank"">Baraniskin et al. Eur J Cancer. 2019;106:37-44</a>). The Subcommittee noted that overall, the analysis of PFS and OS favoured bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit was more pronounced when bevacizumab was combined with fluoropyrimidine monotherapy compared with combination therapies such as 5-FU plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The Subcommittee also considered that the studies included were relatively old and most were only powered to detect a PFS benefit. Members considered that bevacizumab likely provides more of a benefit when used in combination with less effective chemotherapy regimens, but that the standard of care combinations in New Zealand (FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, CAPOX) are relatively effective. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted an analysis of an observational cohort study (BRiTE) that investigated the association between various pre- and post-treatment factors and survival in patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab beyond first-line (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18854571"" target=""_blank"">Grothey et al. J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:5326-34</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this study reported that bevacizumab treatment beyond progression was associated with improved survival compared with no bevacizumab beyond progression (HR 0.48; P&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a meta-analysis that investigated whether continuation of antiangiogenic drugs beyond progression provided clinical benefit in patients with mCRC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021498/"" target=""_blank"">Hoffheinz et al. Gastroenterol Res Pract. 2016;2016:9189483</a>). The Subcommittee noted that this study reported that continuing antiangiogenic treatment beyond progression significantly improved PFS (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.75) and OS (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.89); however, it was also noted that the test for heterogeneity of study results was significant for both OS and PFS (primarily due to the FOSCO trial). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the findings of two studies that investigated whether primary tumour location affected outcomes in patients with left- and right-sided mCRC treated with cetuximab or bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722750"" target=""_blank"">Tejpar et al.

The Subcommittee considered that these studies suggest that patients with right-sided mCRC have a poorer prognosis than patients with left-sided mCRC, and that patients with right-sided mCRC derived limited incremental benefit from treatment with bevacizumab.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the major safety concerns with bevacizumab are hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, thromboembolic events, and fistulae. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence currently available, noting it is unlikely that further prospective studies would be conducted, was modest and indicates that bevacizumab provides only a marginal incremental survival benefit when used in combination with standard of care chemotherapy combinations such as FOLFIRI and FOLFOX. The Subcommittee therefore considered that given the marginal benefit the application for bevacizumab for the first- and second-line treatment of mCRC should be declined and particularly noting the relatively high current price of bevacizumab.</p><p><br></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000B5hzQAC'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Discussion': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Nov 2019', 'fs': 'Nov 2019', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Clinical advice required', 'fs': 'Clinical advice required', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000EY56w2AD'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000EY56w2AD', 'Event_Date__c': '2019-11-01', 'Event_Description__c': 'Clinical advice required', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Nov 2019', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000BVcwQAG'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Discussion': {'s': '<p>3.3<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>In regards to item 5; cetuximab and bevacizumab for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) left-sided CRC and bevacizumab right-sided CRC, the Committee noted that CaTSoP had recommended that cetuximab for the first-line treatment of left-sided metastatic colorectal cancer be funded with a medium priority subject to Special Authority criteria.</p><p>3.4<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the application for cetuximab for the first-line treatment of RAS wild-type, left-sided metastatic CRC was reviewed by PTAC in August 2018; and recommended for decline.
