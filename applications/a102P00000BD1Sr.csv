The Committee noted that these clones produce misfolded immunoglobulin light chains that aggregate into amyloid protein deposits (insoluble fibrils) within organs causing organ dysfunction, progressive disability, and death (mainly driven by cardiac disease). The Committee noted that AL amyloidosis is rare but considered that it doesn’t meet Pharmac’s <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/medicines-for-rare-disorders/"" target=""_blank"">Policy principles for rare disorders</a>. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that patients with abnormal immunoglobulins identified may experience a challenging diagnostic process, often resulting in delayed start to treatment.

J Intern Med. 2021;289:268-92</a>). The Committee noted that there is usually multi-organ involvement also at diagnosis, leading to worse prognosis and earlier death (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13681"" target=""_blank"">Oubari et al. Eur J Haematol. [Epub ahead of print] 2021. [cited 16 2021 Aug 16]</a>).

Blood Cancer J. 2021;11:97</a>). The Committee considered <span style=""color: black;"">that prognosis and survival in AL amyloidosis appear to depend on treatment efficacy, which is assessed in the clinical trial evidence using a range of measures including haematological response (which </span>consists of the removal of free light-chain proteins in plasma) and a range of organ-related measures (such as N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level. The Committee considered that haematological response in particular appeared to be predictive of survival in AL amyloidosis.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatments used for AL amyloidosis are in many cases derived from those used in other plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, and are used as lines of therapy with the potential for retreatment using the same treatment/regimen if a patient responded well to it previously. The Committee considered that in AL amyloidosis, as in multiple myeloma, there are diminishing benefits with each subsequent line of treatment although survival data for treatments for AL amyloidosis is confounded by their use as retreatment. However, the Committee noted that survival of patients with AL amyloidosis had increased over recent cohorts due to the availability of newer, more effective treatments for multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis (eg bortezomib).</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the choice of treatment for AL amyloidosis depends on prognostic patient characteristics including age, frailty, comorbidities, cardiac status, organ involvement, cytogenetics and ECOG performance status. The Committee noted that bortezomib is funded for patients with AL amyloidosis subject to <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2021/08/01/SA1889.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Special Authority criteria</a> and that it rapidly reduces light chains. The Committee noted that thalidomide is also funded for systemic AL amyloidosis subject to <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2021/10/01/SA1124.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Special Authority criteria</a>. The Committee noted that the preferred first-line treatment regimen consists of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CyBorD) used in about 75% of New Zealand cases, while cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) or melphalan with dexamethasone are used in about 25%. The Committee considered that about 36% of patients would be expected to discontinue CyBorD early but that only about 4% of those might be due to toxicity, with other reasons to discontinue being death, proceeding to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or undergoing other therapies. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that only about 10% of patients with AL amyloidosis in New Zealand would be suitable candidates for ASCT, with or without bortezomib-based induction therapy, if performed early in cases without significant organ damage. The Committee considered that the few patients who received ASCT might have improved survival and was made aware of evidence reporting that, of those who had survived for at least ten years post-diagnosis, 47% remained treatment-free (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/31298751/"" target=""_blank"">Muchtar et al. Br J Haematol. 2019;187:588-94</a>). The Committee noted that, for the majority who are ineligible for ASCT, bortezomib plays a key role in early treatment. The Committee noted that about one third of patients die within one year of diagnosis and four-year survival is 54% (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28126928/"" target=""_blank"">Muchtar E, et al.

The Committee noted that patients with Mayo 2004 stage IIIa cardiac disease receive a benefit from bortezomib-containing regimens (median overall survival [OS] of patients with IIIa disease was 25.9 months) but that there is a poor prognosis for Mayo stage IIIb disease (3.5 months).

The Committee therefore considered that while there was no significant OS benefit offered by daratumumab after 15 months (from median 20.3 months follow-up data), it was reasonable to assume that daratumumab offered a survival benefit in this setting, and that this survival benefit may become apparent after 4 years. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.30.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee <span style=""color: black;"">considered that daratumumab IV could similarly be used to treat this population, noting that CaTSoP has previously considered there was no evidence to suggest a difference in efficacy between daratumumab IV and SC for multiple myeloma (</span><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CaTSoP, July 2021</a><span style=""color: black;"">). </span>The Committee <span style=""color: black;"">considered that there was no evidence to indicate that the use of daratumumab IV would present a risk of volume overload in AL amyloidosis and that careful patient selection by clinicians and appropriate management would be reasonable for patient safety (eg. in cases with cardiac involvement).

The Committee noted that after median follow-up of 11.4 months, the overall haematologic response rate was 53.3% with D-VCd vs 18.1% with VCd with a relative risk ratio of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.1 to 4.1) and odds ratio of 5.1 (95% CI: 3.2 to 8.2; P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). The Committee noted that a very good partial response (VGPR) was defined as either a reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC (dFLC) of &lt;40 mg/L from baseline dFLC of at least 50 mg/L, or at least a 90% reduction in serum M-protein if baseline dFLC was less than 50 mg/L.

The Committee noted that the odds ratio for cardiac response rate at 12 months was 3.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 6.2; P&lt;0.0001). The Committee noted that renal response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in proteinuria or drop in proteinuria below 0.5 g/24 hours in the absence of renal progression. The Committee noted that renal response rates with longer follow-up were 57% with D-VCd vs 27% with VCd at 12 months (odds ratio 4.1; 95% CI 2.3 to 7.3; P&lt;0.0001). The Committee considered that this was evidence of some improvement but that the magnitude of benefit was uncertain given the endpoints used markers of response instead of objective measures of organ function. The Committee considered that the addition of daratumumab to VCd was unlikely to improve rates of renal transplant in New Zealand patients diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, as most would be diagnosed at a late stage in the disease course.

The Committee considered that despite not being reported in a peer-reviewed journal, the HRQOL data from a wide range of measures were informative and appeared to show real differences in treatment effect between groups. However, the Committee noted that HRQOL data was not collected for the VCd group beyond six months and considered that made it challenging to delineate between improvements in HRQOL from D-VCd treatment and improvement resulting from bortezomib discontinuation after six months in both groups. The Committee noted that improvements in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 global health score and fatigue score were reported with both D-VCd and VCd up until cycle six, and that both measures then improved beyond cycle six with D-VCd.

The Committee therefore considered that while there was no significant OS benefit offered by daratumumab after 15 months (from median 20.3 months follow-up data), it was reasonable to assume that daratumumab offered a survival benefit in this setting, and that this survival benefit may become apparent after 4 years. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.30.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee <span style=""color: black;"">considered that daratumumab IV could similarly be used to treat this population, noting that CaTSoP has previously considered there was no evidence to suggest a difference in efficacy between daratumumab IV and SC for multiple myeloma (</span><a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-07-Catsop_record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CaTSoP, July 2021</a><span style=""color: black;"">). </span>The Committee <span style=""color: black;"">considered that there was no evidence to indicate that the use of daratumumab IV would present a risk of volume overload in AL amyloidosis and that careful patient selection by clinicians and appropriate management would be reasonable for patient safety (eg. in cases with cardiac involvement).

Presented at the 25th European Haematology Association (EHA25) Annual Congress 2020; Abstract Nr LB2604</a>). ANDROMEDA included 388 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with at least one organ impacted, cardiac stage I-IIIA disease (Mayo 2004), ECOG performance status of less than three, and eGFR of at least 20 mL/min/1.73m2 . Participants received either bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CyBorD) then observation until major organ deterioration-PFS, or D-VCd (daratumumab SC plus CyBorD) with daratumumab SC maintenance until major organ deterioration-progression free survival (PFS) for a maximum of 24 cycles.</p><p><br></p><p>1.8 The Committee noted that the ANDROMEDA trial results were appraised by <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC in November 2021</a>, including the primary endpoint (haematologic complete response), and secondary endpoints including major organ deterioration-progression free survival (a composite endpoint), cardiac response, renal response, haematological progression, subsequent therapies and overall survival (OS). The Committee noted that a large proportion of the trial population received daratumumab post-progression and considered that this confounded the OS outcomes, although such a difference may not have been seen with the relatively short trial follow-up of median 11.4 months.</p><p><br></p><p>1.9 Members considered that haematologic, cardiac and renal outcomes were established in the literature as good surrogate outcomes for cardiac response and survival in AL amyloidosis, and that there was evidence of a link between depth of these responses and survival. The Committee was made aware of the following evidence supporting haematological response and cardiac biomarkers as acceptable surrogates for overall survival in AL amyloidosis:\xa0</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.9.1 An analysis of 816 patients with AL amyloidosis receiving first-line treatment in the EU and US reported that the extent of reduction of amyloidogenic free light chains (FLCs), and especially the depth of this response, was linked with survival at three months and six months (Palladini et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:4541-9).</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.9.2. A prospective observational study of 915 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis who received bortezomib reported that haematologic response in FLCs and the depth of this response predicted survival (Manwani et al. Blood. 2019;134:2271-80).</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.9.3. A study of 94 patients with AL amyloidosis who had N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measured at six months post treatment demonstrated a link between NT-proBNP response and survival in cardiac disease (Lilleness et al. Br J Haematol. 2020;188:424-7).</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.9.4. A further publication reporting whether NT-proBNP, troponin and NYHA response could predict survival in 248 patients with AL amyloidosis with renal failure; the authors considered that these were robust surrogates for cardiac dysfunction and prognosis noting the need to interpret this alongside eGFR (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.23141"" target=""_blank"">Palladini et al. Am J Hematol. 2012;87:465-71</a>)</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.9.5. A study of 416 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis reporting that deeper organ (heart, kidney, liver) response was associated with better survival (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/130/Supplement%201/3154/114456/Depth-of-Organ-Response-in-Newly-Diagnosed-AL"" target=""_blank"">Muchtar et al. Blood. 2017;130(Suppl_1):3154</a>)</p><p><br></p><p>1.10 The Committee noted that long-term efficacy data for daratumumab in AL amyloidosis is not yet available, however, considered it reasonable to infer from the duration of response seen in long-term data for multiple myeloma. The Committee noted the time to maximum organ response in AL amyloidosis of 24 or 30 months (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/130/Supplement%201/3154/114456/Depth-of-Organ-Response-in-Newly-Diagnosed-AL"" target=""_blank"">Muchtar et al. Blood 2017; 130 (Supplement 1): 3154</a>). The Committee noted that ANDROMEDA already reported substantial organ improvement from the reduction in\xa0light chains despite the trial’s short follow-up duration and considered that the ongoing organ responses would be expected to improve with further time. The Committee therefore considered that daratumumab would provide durable organ responses in AL amyloidosis. Further, the Committee considered that improved quality of life (QOL) would be expected given that deeper organ responses are assumed to be associated with both survival and better QOL.</p><p><br></p><p>1.11. The Committee noted that treatment of multiple myeloma is less efficacious in subsequent lines and considered it reasonable to assume that people with AL amyloidosis would also experience less durable and deeper responses in later lines of therapy as the biologic rationale is similar for both diseases. Members considered that increasing rates of treatment resistance would likely develop in later lines of therapy and that it would be reasonable to use multiple myeloma data to model this in AL amyloidosis.</p><p><br></p><p>1.12. Overall, the Committee considered that there was good evidence of meaningful clinical responses (deep and rapid haematologic response and organ improvement) with some evidence of QOL equivalence, although noting the short trial follow-up duration. The Committee considered that good quality OS data would not be expected to eventuate due to crossover. However, the Committee considered that the endpoints for haematological and organ responses are robust surrogates for OS in this context and that QOL benefits would be anticipated from organ responses in the long term.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Costs and Savings and Special Authority criteria </em></p><p>1.13. The Committee considered that, under the proposed Special Authority criteria, the number of people eligible would be small (ie three per million per year). The Committee considered that should daratumumab be funded for multiple myeloma in the second line setting, if funded for AL-amyloidosis, it would be reasonable to limit access to daratumumab to once per lifetime of the individual, regardless of the indication for which it is funded.</p><p><br></p><p>1.14. The Committee considered that it would be difficult to differentiate between AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, if daratumumab were funded for either indication. The Committee considered that the Special Authority criteria should limit the ability to receive daratumumab for both multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis on separate occasions (eg individuals with multiple myeloma who had already been treated with daratumumab should not also receive funded daratumumab for AL amyloidosis).</p><p><br></p><p>1.15. The Committee considered that reduction in light chains is critical to treatment success and improvement in AL amyloidosis and therefore considered that funded treatment with daratumumab for this population should stop upon haematological progression or cease based on a lack of haematological response at three months, noting the median time to haematological response of 60 days in ANDROMEDA.</p><p><br></p><p>1.16. The Committee noted that people in the ANDROMEDA trial were treated with daratumumab for a maximum of 24 months. The Committee was made aware of a retrospective analysis of 15 patients with AL amyloidosis who received daratumumab monotherapy and dexamethasone for at least 2 months before discontinuing after achieving a complete response. The Committee noted that this study reported no significant difference in the time to next treatment or death between the group with time limited daratumumab and those who recieved continuous maintenance (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497118598013"" target=""_blank"">Chung et al. Blood. 2019;134(Suppl_1):1884</a>). The Committee therefore considered it reasonable to fund 24 months’ treatment as supported by the trial evidence, given\xa0that the benefit of treatment beyond 24 months was unclear from the data available at this time, but considered that this should be revisited as part of a new funding application if further data were to eventuate in future.</p><p><br></p><p>1.17. Members considered that treatment with daratumumab could increase the number of individuals with AL amyloidosis who could proceed to ASCT by approximately 10% (therefore 30% of this population) but that this was unlikely to be hugely impactful to the health sector due to the overall small numbers concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>1.18. Members noted an economic assessment by Canada’s Drug and Health Technology Agency (CADTH) of daratumumab for AL amyloidosis, which modelled treatment benefit based on haematological response data from ANDROMEDA and evidence from Kastritis et al. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32713209/"" target=""_blank"">Amyloid. 2020;28:3-11</a>) on OS associated with different levels of hematologic response. The Committee considered this modelling approach was appropriate for use in Pharmac’s assessment of daratumumab for this indication given the lack of available long-term OS data from ANDROMEDA.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><em>Summary for Assessment</em></p><p>1.19. The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for daratumumab SC if it were to be funded in New Zealand for AL amyloidosis.

The Committee noted that people in the ANDROMEDA trial were treated with daratumumab for a maximum of 24 months. The Committee was made aware of a retrospective analysis of 15 patients with AL amyloidosis who received daratumumab monotherapy and dexamethasone for at least 2 months before discontinuing after achieving a complete response. The Committee noted that this study reported no significant difference in the time to next treatment or death between the group with time limited daratumumab and those who recieved continuous maintenance (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497118598013"" target=""_blank"">Chung et al.

The Committee therefore considered it reasonable to fund 24 months’ treatment as supported by the trial evidence, given\xa0that the benefit of treatment beyond 24 months was unclear from the data available at this time, but considered that this should be revisited as part of a new funding application if further data were to eventuate in future.</p><p><br></p><p>1.17. Members considered that treatment with daratumumab could increase the number of individuals with AL amyloidosis who could proceed to ASCT by approximately 10% (therefore 30% of this population) but that this was unlikely to be hugely impactful to the health sector due to the overall small numbers concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>1.18. Members noted an economic assessment by Canada’s Drug and Health Technology Agency (CADTH) of daratumumab for AL amyloidosis, which modelled treatment benefit based on haematological response data from ANDROMEDA and evidence from Kastritis et al. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32713209/"" target=""_blank"">Amyloid. 2020;28:3-11</a>) on OS associated with different levels of hematologic response.

The Committee considered that any treatment for AL amyloidosis that may increase the proportion of individuals who are candidates for transplant or lead to improve organ responses would likely be very beneficial for Māori.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background </em></p><p>1.2. The Committee noted that the application for subcutaneous daratumumab (Darxalex SC) in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd; CyBorD) for the treatment of people with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis was considered by <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PTAC in November 2021.</a> At that time, PTAC recommended daratumumab (intravenous or SC) be funded for this indication with a medium priority and requested Pharmac seek advice from the Cancer Treatments Advisory Committee regarding appropriate stopping criteria, and views regarding use of a 12- month duration of approval in the Special Authority criteria for daratumumab for AL amyloidosis.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Need</em>\xa0</p><p>1.3 The Committee noted that AL amyloidosis is generally associated with plasma cell dyscrasia in those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and in multiple myeloma, with the aim of treatment for these conditions being reduction in light chain production by targeting plasma cells. The Committee noted that individuals can have both AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma (although the ANROMEDA trial excluded patients with myeloma) and considered it important to consider daratumumab for those with both AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma due to the overlap in their presentation and management. The Committee noted that organ dysfunction from amyloid deposits can preclude ASCT and that prognosis relates to the extent of organ dysfunction. The Committee noted that the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma has been previously discussed and that treatment for AL amyloidosis in the context of MGUS consists of either bortezomib or thalidomide (not lenalidomide).</p><p><br></p><p>1.4. The Committee agreed with PTAC’s views that people with AL amyloidosis have a high health need despite currently funded therapies. The Committee considered that this was especially true of those for whom transplant is unsuitable and currently have no further treatment option to deepen their response. The Committee reiterated the need for an effective therapy to reduce light chain production to prevent further organ dysfunction from AL amyloidosis. Members considered that more intensive induction therapy may also increase the number of individuals receiving an organ response and ultimately becoming candidates for transplant.</p><p><br></p><p>1.5 The Committee noted the rarity of AL amyloidosis (affecting approximately three per million in the population) and the absence of ethnicity data for New Zealand cases. The Committee noted that myeloma has a higher age-standardised incidence for Māori, who have younger age at presentation than non-Māori. Members considered it was unclear whether there was a difference in MGUS incidence or AL amyloidosis incidence according to ethnicity in New Zealand population groups.</p><p><br></p><p>1.6 The Committee considered that the extent of comorbidity in those with AL amyloidosis can impact on the degree of organ dysfunction and/or suitability for transplant, such as the combination of heart failure from ischemic heart disease and cardiac amyloidosis. The Committee considered that Māori may experience a greater impact from the disease due to the higher rates of comorbidity and noted that there are reduced rates of ASCT for Māori with myeloma compared with other population groups.

The Committee noted that people in the ANDROMEDA trial were treated with daratumumab for a maximum of 24 months. The Committee was made aware of a retrospective analysis of 15 patients with AL amyloidosis who received daratumumab monotherapy and dexamethasone for at least 2 months before discontinuing after achieving a complete response. The Committee noted that this study reported no significant difference in the time to next treatment or death between the group with time limited daratumumab and those who recieved continuous maintenance (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497118598013"" target=""_blank"">Chung et al. Blood. 2019;134(Suppl_1):1884</a>). The Committee therefore considered it reasonable to fund 24 months’ treatment as supported by the trial evidence, given\xa0that the benefit of treatment beyond 24 months was unclear from the data available at this time, but considered that this should be revisited as part of a new funding application if further data were to eventuate in future.</p><p><br></p><p>1.17. Members considered that treatment with daratumumab could increase the number of individuals with AL amyloidosis who could proceed to ASCT by approximately 10% (therefore 30% of this population) but that this was unlikely to be hugely impactful to the health sector due to the overall small numbers concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>1.18. Members noted an economic assessment by Canada’s Drug and Health Technology Agency (CADTH) of daratumumab for AL amyloidosis, which modelled treatment benefit based on haematological response data from ANDROMEDA and evidence from Kastritis et al. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32713209/"" target=""_blank"">Amyloid. 2020;28:3-11</a>) on OS associated with different levels of hematologic response. The Committee considered this modelling approach was appropriate for use in Pharmac’s assessment of daratumumab for this indication given the lack of available long-term OS data from ANDROMEDA.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><em>Summary for Assessment</em></p><p>1.19. The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for daratumumab SC if it were to be funded in New Zealand for AL amyloidosis. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p>\xa0<img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000006fVQv&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002kbw2"" alt=""image.png""></img></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000EDzXQAW'}, 'change': None}]",Oct 2021,False,True

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
