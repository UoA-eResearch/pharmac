Overactive bladder can result from a range of causes, and while not all cases can be cured, therapy can lead to symptom improvement for many patients. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of overactive bladder is approximately 16% based on data from the USA and Europe, older people are disproportionately affected (New Zealand data is sparse, however, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA] states that up to 30% of people over 75 years of age have \u00a0overactive bladder), and it occurs more commonly in females than men (with a ratio of 6:1). Members considered that patients over 75 years of age would be the target population sought for this funding application.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the severity of overactive bladder would vary among individuals, which would impact on the health need of patients. Members considered that individuals with overactive bladder are a broad group, and that this is an example of a normal physical process being medicalised and targeted, e.g. by direct advertising to consumers (DTCA) as requiring medical treatment, resulting in over-diagnosis (including self-diagnosis), both of which contribute to a risk of unnecessary overtreatment in this patient population.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that overactive bladder can affect family and wh\u0101nau and noted evidence that suggests that overactive bladder patients who have cognitive impairment may have an increased likelihood of the need to move into a care facility (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617737\" target=\"_blank\">Luppa et al. Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2008:26;65-78</a>), although Members considered that overactive bladder, on its own, is not generally a significant contributing factor triggering the decision for patient admission to a care facility.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that international treatment strategies for overactive bladder use sequential approaches, progressing to the next step if desired outcomes are not achieved and start with patient/carer education, then behavioural treatment, addition of anticholinergic agents (specifically antimuscarinic medications), reassessment and further diagnostic assessments, and then more invasive treatments in selected patients. </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that current medications used to treat overactive bladder in New Zealand are anticholinergic agents including oxybutynin (funded without restriction), solifenacin (funded, but with hospital use restricted to use in patients with overactive bladder and a documented intolerance of, or non-response to, oxybutynin), and tolterodine (funded, but restricted to use in patients with overactive bladder and a documented intolerance of, or non-response to, oxybutynin). The Committee noted that about 32,000 New Zealand patients receive treatment with one of these agents. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that alternative treatment options for patients in New Zealand with overactive bladder include pelvic floor exercises, sacral nerve stimulator implant and other surgical interventions (where surgery, for urinary stress incontinence, can inadvertently worsen overactive bladder in patients who present with mixed stress/urge incontinence) and intravesical Botulinum toxin injections (which are more difficult to use in elderly patients and require confirmation of diagnosis by urodynamic studies in symptomatic patients).</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the applicant states that there are New Zealand patients with overactive bladder who cannot tolerate anticholinergics, and patients who have concurrent incontinence and cognitive impairment or dementia. The Committee noted that the oxybutynin data sheet states that it should be used with caution in elderly patients who are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment due to oxybutynin (Source: <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/a/Apooxybutynintabsyrup.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Apo-oxybutynin data sheet, March 2018</a>), and considered that clinical experience provides similar caution. The Committee was concerned that NHI-linked dispensing data indicate about 440 New Zealand patients receive both a cholinesterase inhibitor for dementia (rivastigmine or donepezil) and an anticholinergic for overactive bladder (oxybutynin, solifenacin or tolterodine). </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for cognitive impairment due to anticholinergic treatment of overactive bladder to be sparse, confined to a follow-up of 69 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia receiving donepezil (of which 16 patients were on anticholinergic agents) which reported <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">after 2 years </span>that Mini-Mental State Examination\u00a0(MMSE)<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> scores were worse for patients receiving anticholinergics </span>(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837675\" target=\"_blank\">Lu et al. Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2003;11:458-61</a>). The Committee noted that patients who have dementia were more likely to be prescribed an anticholinergic (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12028169\" target=\"_blank\">Roe et al. J Am Geriatr Soc. 2002:50;836-42</a>) and that there was an association, which is not necessarily causal, between the odds of dementia and anticholinergics (50% increase in odds of dementia within 10 years), although interpretation in the context of prevalent mild dementia in older age is required (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31233095\" target=\"_blank\">Coupland et al.

The Committee noted that mirabegron is manufactured as 25 mg and 50 mg tablets and the applicant proposed dosing of 50 mg once daily. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not approved by Medsafe and there is no New Zealand supplier for this product. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical trial evidence for mirabegron predominantly consists of trials comparing mirabegron with tolterodine, some comparing with solifenacin, and none directly comparing mirabegron with oxybutynin. The Committee noted that published clinical trials included patients over 18 years of age with symptoms of overactive bladder for more than 3 months, with urinary frequency (more than 8 micturitions in 24 hours) and urgency (more than 3 urge episodes in 24 hours), with or without urinary incontinence. </p><p><i style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Evidence</i></p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the randomised (1:1), phase IIIb, double-blind, non-inferiority BEYOND trial of mirabegron (50 mg once daily) compared to solifenacin (5 mg once daily) for 12 weeks in 1,887 patients whose previous treatment with antimuscarinic agents was ineffective (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26445596\" target=\"_blank\">Batista et al. Ther Adv Urol. 2015:7;167-79</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">)</u>. The Committee noted that the adjusted mean number of micturations per 24-hours was 2.95 (SE 0.09) with mirabegron compared to 3.13 (0.09) with solifenacin, and considered that mirabegron had similar efficacy to solifenacin. The Committee noted that treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in a greater proportion of solifenacin patients (14.5%) than mirabegron patients (11.1%) in the BEYOND trial, including dry mouth (5.8% solifenacin compared with 3.1% mirabegron), and that patient reported outcomes (PRO) showed superiority of solifenacin in four out of five assessments.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results depicted for the randomised, phase II, double-blind, parallel, placebo and monotherapy-controlled Symphony trial of several dose schedules of solifenacin and mirabegron as monotherapy and in combinations for 12 weeks in 1,306 patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612659\" target=\"_blank\">Abrams et al. Eur Urol. 2015:67;577-88</a>). The Committee noted that the adjusted change in mean number of micturations per 24-hours was greater with 10 mg solifenacin monotherapy than with either 25 mg and 50 mg doses of mirabegron monotherapy, and that the adjusted change in mean volume voided was similar with 10 mg solifenacin compared to 50 mg mirabegron. The Committee noted that the adjusted change in mean number of urgency episodes was reduced with 10 mg solifenacin and was slightly increased with 50 mg mirabegron. The Committee considered that, based on this data, mirabegron offers roughly the same or slightly less health benefit as solifenacin.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Symphony trial did not provide safety data regarding cognitive changes. The Committee noted that there was a higher rate of serious AEs with mirabegron 50 mg (2.6%) than with solifenacin 10 mg (1.3%), the same proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent AEs in each of these two treatment groups (2.6%), and the most frequent AEs with each treatment were hypertension (14.1% of patients with mirabegron 50 mg) and dry mouth, which is expected with anticholinergic agents (29.5% of patients with solifenacin 10 mg). </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a meta-analysis comparing mirabegron (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) with tolterodine (4 mg) and with placebo in a total of 5,117 patients over 65 years of age, pooled from three 12-week trials and one 1-year trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610862\" target=\"_blank\">Wagg et al. Age Ageing. 2014:43;666-75</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">)</u>. The Committee noted that mirabegron 50 mg was associated with a greater adjusted change in the number of incontinence episodes per 24-hours and the number of micturitions per 24 hours (-0.40 and -0.55, respectively) compared with tolterodine (-0.10 and -0.25, respectively) in all patients. The Committee noted that patients over 75 years of age had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, hypertension and discontinuation at 12 weeks with tolterodine and had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, discontinuations and serious AEs at 1 year with mirabegron 50 mg. </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1:1), active-controlled trial comparing 12 months\u2019 treatment with mirabegron (50 mg or 100 mg) or tolterodine 4 mg in 2,444 adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195283\" target=\"_blank\">Chapple et al. Eur Urol. 2013: 63;296-305</a>). The Committee considered that the results showed mirabegron had greater efficacy than tolterodine and the safety data included roughly the same incidence of hypertension and cardiac AEs (including major adverse cardiovascular events; MACE) between treatment groups, although no cognitive AE data was reported. The Committee noted that there was no difference in patient-reported outcomes (PRO) between treatment groups.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, trial comparing mirabegron (50 mg or 100 mg), tolterodine (4 mg) and placebo for 12 weeks in 1,978 adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182126\" target=\"_blank\">Khullar et al. Eur Urol. 2013:63;283-95</a>). The Committee considered that the results indicated mirabegron has superior efficacy compared with tolterodine for incontinence and frequency (although there was a small clinically significant difference compared with placebo) and that the safety data was similar to other studies although no cognitive AE data was reported. The Committee considered that the PRO data suggested that mirabegron was equivalent to tolterodine, based on 3 PRO assessment measures.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the PREFER trial; a phase IV, double-blind, 8-week crossover, randomised (5:5:1:1) trial of mirabegron-tolterodine, tolterodine-mirabegron, mirabegron-mirabegron, or tolterodine-tolterodine (separated by a 2 week washout period) in 358 treatment-na\u00efve adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620791\" target=\"_blank\">Staskin et al. Int Urogynaecol J. 2018:29;273-83</a>). The Committee noted that the dose of mirabegron was increased halfway through this crossover study and considered that the results provide information on treatment sequencing with the second agent being preferred. The Committee considered that mirabegron was tolerated better than tolterodine and noted that PRO were similar between treatment groups in the PREFER trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673355\" target=\"_blank\">Herschorn et al.

Overactive bladder can result from a range of causes, and while not all cases can be cured, therapy can lead to symptom improvement for many patients. </p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of overactive bladder is approximately 16% based on data from the USA and Europe, older people are disproportionately affected (New Zealand data is sparse, however, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA] states that up to 30% of people over 75 years of age have \u00a0overactive bladder), and it occurs more commonly in females than men (with a ratio of 6:1).

Members considered that individuals with overactive bladder are a broad group, and that this is an example of a normal physical process being medicalised and targeted, e.g. by direct advertising to consumers (DTCA) as requiring medical treatment, resulting in over-diagnosis (including self-diagnosis), both of which contribute to a risk of unnecessary overtreatment in this patient population.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that overactive bladder can affect family and wh\u0101nau and noted evidence that suggests that overactive bladder patients who have cognitive impairment may have an increased likelihood of the need to move into a care facility (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617737\" target=\"_blank\">Luppa et al. Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2008:26;65-78</a>), although Members considered that overactive bladder, on its own, is not generally a significant contributing factor triggering the decision for patient admission to a care facility.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that international treatment strategies for overactive bladder use sequential approaches, progressing to the next step if desired outcomes are not achieved and start with patient/carer education, then behavioural treatment, addition of anticholinergic agents (specifically antimuscarinic medications), reassessment and further diagnostic assessments, and then more invasive treatments in selected patients. </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that current medications used to treat overactive bladder in New Zealand are anticholinergic agents including oxybutynin (funded without restriction), solifenacin (funded, but with hospital use restricted to use in patients with overactive bladder and a documented intolerance of, or non-response to, oxybutynin), and tolterodine (funded, but restricted to use in patients with overactive bladder and a documented intolerance of, or non-response to, oxybutynin). The Committee noted that about 32,000 New Zealand patients receive treatment with one of these agents. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that alternative treatment options for patients in New Zealand with overactive bladder include pelvic floor exercises, sacral nerve stimulator implant and other surgical interventions (where surgery, for urinary stress incontinence, can inadvertently worsen overactive bladder in patients who present with mixed stress/urge incontinence) and intravesical Botulinum toxin injections (which are more difficult to use in elderly patients and require confirmation of diagnosis by urodynamic studies in symptomatic patients).</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the applicant states that there are New Zealand patients with overactive bladder who cannot tolerate anticholinergics, and patients who have concurrent incontinence and cognitive impairment or dementia. The Committee noted that the oxybutynin data sheet states that it should be used with caution in elderly patients who are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment due to oxybutynin (Source: <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/a/Apooxybutynintabsyrup.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Apo-oxybutynin data sheet, March 2018</a>), and considered that clinical experience provides similar caution. The Committee was concerned that NHI-linked dispensing data indicate about 440 New Zealand patients receive both a cholinesterase inhibitor for dementia (rivastigmine or donepezil) and an anticholinergic for overactive bladder (oxybutynin, solifenacin or tolterodine). </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for cognitive impairment due to anticholinergic treatment of overactive bladder to be sparse, confined to a follow-up of 69 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia receiving donepezil (of which 16 patients were on anticholinergic agents) which reported <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">after 2 years </span>that Mini-Mental State Examination\u00a0(MMSE)<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> scores were worse for patients receiving anticholinergics </span>(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837675\" target=\"_blank\">Lu et al.

J Am Geriatr Soc. 2002:50;836-42</a>) and that there was an association, which is not necessarily causal, between the odds of dementia and anticholinergics (50% increase in odds of dementia within 10 years), although interpretation in the context of prevalent mild dementia in older age is required (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31233095\" target=\"_blank\">Coupland et al.

The Committee noted that mirabegron is manufactured as 25 mg and 50 mg tablets and the applicant proposed dosing of 50 mg once daily. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not approved by Medsafe and there is no New Zealand supplier for this product. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the clinical trial evidence for mirabegron predominantly consists of trials comparing mirabegron with tolterodine, some comparing with solifenacin, and none directly comparing mirabegron with oxybutynin. The Committee noted that published clinical trials included patients over 18 years of age with symptoms of overactive bladder for more than 3 months, with urinary frequency (more than 8 micturitions in 24 hours) and urgency (more than 3 urge episodes in 24 hours), with or without urinary incontinence. </p><p><i style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Evidence</i></p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the randomised (1:1), phase IIIb, double-blind, non-inferiority BEYOND trial of mirabegron (50 mg once daily) compared to solifenacin (5 mg once daily) for 12 weeks in 1,887 patients whose previous treatment with antimuscarinic agents was ineffective (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26445596\" target=\"_blank\">Batista et al. Ther Adv Urol. 2015:7;167-79</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">)</u>. The Committee noted that the adjusted mean number of micturations per 24-hours was 2.95 (SE 0.09) with mirabegron compared to 3.13 (0.09) with solifenacin, and considered that mirabegron had similar efficacy to solifenacin. The Committee noted that treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in a greater proportion of solifenacin patients (14.5%) than mirabegron patients (11.1%) in the BEYOND trial, including dry mouth (5.8% solifenacin compared with 3.1% mirabegron), and that patient reported outcomes (PRO) showed superiority of solifenacin in four out of five assessments.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results depicted for the randomised, phase II, double-blind, parallel, placebo and monotherapy-controlled Symphony trial of several dose schedules of solifenacin and mirabegron as monotherapy and in combinations for 12 weeks in 1,306 patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612659\" target=\"_blank\">Abrams et al. Eur Urol. 2015:67;577-88</a>). The Committee noted that the adjusted change in mean number of micturations per 24-hours was greater with 10 mg solifenacin monotherapy than with either 25 mg and 50 mg doses of mirabegron monotherapy, and that the adjusted change in mean volume voided was similar with 10 mg solifenacin compared to 50 mg mirabegron. The Committee noted that the adjusted change in mean number of urgency episodes was reduced with 10 mg solifenacin and was slightly increased with 50 mg mirabegron. The Committee considered that, based on this data, mirabegron offers roughly the same or slightly less health benefit as solifenacin.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Symphony trial did not provide safety data regarding cognitive changes. The Committee noted that there was a higher rate of serious AEs with mirabegron 50 mg (2.6%) than with solifenacin 10 mg (1.3%), the same proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent AEs in each of these two treatment groups (2.6%), and the most frequent AEs with each treatment were hypertension (14.1% of patients with mirabegron 50 mg) and dry mouth, which is expected with anticholinergic agents (29.5% of patients with solifenacin 10 mg). </p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a meta-analysis comparing mirabegron (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) with tolterodine (4 mg) and with placebo in a total of 5,117 patients over 65 years of age, pooled from three 12-week trials and one 1-year trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610862\" target=\"_blank\">Wagg et al. Age Ageing. 2014:43;666-75</a><u style=\"color: blue;\">)</u>. The Committee noted that mirabegron 50 mg was associated with a greater adjusted change in the number of incontinence episodes per 24-hours and the number of micturitions per 24 hours (-0.40 and -0.55, respectively) compared with tolterodine (-0.10 and -0.25, respectively) in all patients. The Committee noted that patients over 75 years of age had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, hypertension and discontinuation at 12 weeks with tolterodine and had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, discontinuations and serious AEs at 1 year with mirabegron 50 mg. </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1:1), active-controlled trial comparing 12 months\u2019 treatment with mirabegron (50 mg or 100 mg) or tolterodine 4 mg in 2,444 adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195283\" target=\"_blank\">Chapple et al. Eur Urol. 2013: 63;296-305</a>). The Committee considered that the results showed mirabegron had greater efficacy than tolterodine and the safety data included roughly the same incidence of hypertension and cardiac AEs (including major adverse cardiovascular events; MACE) between treatment groups, although no cognitive AE data was reported. The Committee noted that there was no difference in patient-reported outcomes (PRO) between treatment groups.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, trial comparing mirabegron (50 mg or 100 mg), tolterodine (4 mg) and placebo for 12 weeks in 1,978 adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182126\" target=\"_blank\">Khullar et al. Eur Urol. 2013:63;283-95</a>). The Committee considered that the results indicated mirabegron has superior efficacy compared with tolterodine for incontinence and frequency (although there was a small clinically significant difference compared with placebo) and that the safety data was similar to other studies although no cognitive AE data was reported. The Committee considered that the PRO data suggested that mirabegron was equivalent to tolterodine, based on 3 PRO assessment measures.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the PREFER trial; a phase IV, double-blind, 8-week crossover, randomised (5:5:1:1) trial of mirabegron-tolterodine, tolterodine-mirabegron, mirabegron-mirabegron, or tolterodine-tolterodine (separated by a 2 week washout period) in 358 treatment-na\u00efve adult patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620791\" target=\"_blank\">Staskin et al. Int Urogynaecol J. 2018:29;273-83</a>). The Committee noted that the dose of mirabegron was increased halfway through this crossover study and considered that the results provide information on treatment sequencing with the second agent being preferred. The Committee considered that mirabegron was tolerated better than tolterodine and noted that PRO were similar between treatment groups in the PREFER trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673355\" target=\"_blank\">Herschorn et al.

Eur Urol. 2017:72;389-99</a>). The Committee noted that a small proportion of patients were on mirabegron (5.5%) but they were more likely to stay on treatment (38% persistence at 12 months) and tolerate it better (median time to discontinuation of 169 days) than patients on tolterodine (20% and 56 days, respectively) or patients on other agents.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a systematic review of 44 randomised controlled trials including 27,309 patients, which assessed the comparative efficacy and safety of mirabegron, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine and other agents (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275310\" target=\"_blank\">Maman et al.

The Committee considered that the body of evidence indicates that solifenacin provides the same or slightly greater health benefit than mirabegron, and that mirabegron provides greater health benefit than tolterodine. The Committee considered that the evidence did not identify a patient group that would benefit most from mirabegron.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the clinical significance of the small reported changes in urination was unclear but would likely have only minimal effects on patient\u2019s lives, and that the clinical trials were well-conducted but of short duration and lacked cognitive AE data, noting that a systematic review reported central nervous system (CNS) AEs were reported in less than a quarter of trials investigating antimuscarinic agents for overactive bladder (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718264\" target=\"_blank\">Paquette et al. J Am Geriatr Soc. 2011:59:1332-9</a>). The Committee considered the efficacy and safety of mirabegron was not affected by concomitant beta blocker use, although mirabegron may be contraindicated in older patients on beta blockers for severe hypertension. The Committee considered that the safety profile data for mirabegron was similar to placebo and tolterodine in regard to MACE, cardiac AEs and hypertension.</p><p><i style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">General</i></p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that funding of mirabegron would not change the number of GP or specialist visits required, or change any other health system resource usage, compared to the currently funded agents. The Committee noted systematic review evidence suggesting that overactive bladder can increase the likelihood of a patient being moved into a care facility (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617737\" target=\"_blank\">Luppa et al.

The Committee considered that there is a high risk of high mirabegron uptake from patients currently on anticholinergic agents, including the 440 patients with dementia and patients for whom other anticholinergics have poor efficacy.</p><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the following Special Authority criteria for mirabegron would be reasonable in the event that the product ever became less expensive, but could be revised to further restrict access to patients on cholinesterase inhibitors and to specify use as monotherapy:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">MIRABEGRON - Special Authority for Subsidy </span></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">Initial application </b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">from any relevant practitioner.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\u00a0</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac\u2019s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual\u2019s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\u00a0</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069\" target=\"_blank\">TA290. NICE, 2013</a>). Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0\" target=\"_blank\">Lozano-Ortega et al. Urology. 2019;127:1-8</a>). However, mirabegron was associated with a lower risk of urinary tract infections compared with onabotulinumtoxinA.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26908514/\" target=\"_blank\">Freemantle et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual\u2019s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3\" target=\"_blank\">Chapple et al.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\u00a0</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac\u2019s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual\u2019s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\u00a0</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069\" target=\"_blank\">TA290. NICE, 2013</a>). Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0\" target=\"_blank\">Lozano-Ortega et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual\u2019s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3\" target=\"_blank\">Chapple et al.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>In <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\u00a0</p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac\u2019s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual\u2019s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\u00a0</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069\" target=\"_blank\">TA290. NICE, 2013</a>). Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0\" target=\"_blank\">Lozano-Ortega et al.

However, mirabegron was associated with a lower risk of urinary tract infections compared with onabotulinumtoxinA.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA may be superior to mirabegron in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26908514/\" target=\"_blank\">Freemantle et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual\u2019s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3\" target=\"_blank\">Chapple et al.
