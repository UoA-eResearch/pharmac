The Committee noted that in addition to the applications received, PHARMAC requested the Committee particularly consider use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma and refractory seizures associated with TSC, noting there may also be a role for mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of other clinical complications of TSC.</p><p>3.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC has previously considered everolimus and sirolimus for renal angiomyolipoma(s) and refractory seizures associated with TSC through the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) process for a small number of patients.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that everolimus has FDA approval for use in treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC and other TSC disease, but sirolimus is not approved by the FDA for this indication. Members noted everolimus for use in the treatment of SEGA associated with TSC is Medsafe approved, however approval has not been sought for everolimus in other TSC disease to date and these would be unapproved indications. Sirolimus is not approved for any TSC-related disorder in New Zealand, however the available formulations may make this a reasonable option. Members noted that there is a liquid formulation that would be suitable to use in children (sirolimus 1mg/ml oral solution); everolimus is only available in tablet form. Both everolimus and sirolimus are listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for other funded indications. Members noted that treatment is continued indefinitely for these funded indications, if the treatment is effective.</p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that TSC is a genetic disorder characterised by the development of benign tumour-like malformations in multiple organ systems; 80% of these mutations occur de novo, with the remainder inherited. The Committee noted that the disease burden increases with age, complications can develop from birth or infancy, and the disease can manifest clinically in the brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, lungs, skin. Disease manifestations can also include impaired cognition, autism, and bipolar disorder. The Committee considered there is a significant unmet health need in patients with TSC but noted that there is minimal quality of life data available for this condition. Members considered that in the later stages of disease, there is increased health need due to respiratory failure.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that development of renal angiomyolipomas is a common, clinically significant complication in TSC, the prevalence of which increases with age. The Committee noted that renal angiomyolipomas are associated with impaired renal function and also that progressive enlargement is a risk factor for spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage and clinically significant haematuria. The Committee considered that patients with renal angiomyolipomas have a high health need due to impaired renal function and bleeding risk, although it is difficult to predict which patients may experience haemorrhage. Members noted clinical practice and treatment guidelines often consider larger tumours are more likely to bleed, however with limited supporting evidence, it is uncertain if this is the case. The Committee considered that the families/wh\u0101nau of patients with renal angiomyolipomas may have additional health needs if a patient\u2019s disease results in renal failure.</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that epilepsy is one of the most frequent and significant causes of morbidity in TSC and is often the presenting symptom. The Committee noted that seizures, caused by benign brain lesions known as tubers, are present in 80 to 90% of patients with TSC before the age of 3 years. Seizure types vary, with infantile spasm being most common at diagnosis; however, focal, tonic-clonic and generalised onset seizures can also occur. The Committee considered that patients who have refractory seizures associated with TSC have a high health need due to the significant cognitive effects of the disease, and considered that parents, caregivers and family/wh\u0101nau of these patients may have a health need due to the impact of this disease in a young patient group. Members considered that about two-thirds of patients with TSC and epilepsy use three or more antiepileptic medications, and about 25% have neurosurgical treatment.</p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no data to indicate the M\u0101ori are disproportionately affected by TSC.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the patient group with non-seizure related complications of TSC is likely relatively small, around 20 patients per year. However, there is uncertainty regarding how many people would experience more than one complication of TSC and require treatment with an mTOR inhibitor. Members noted that PHARMAC staff estimates were based on uptake of everolimus use in Australia for renal angiomyolipoma which would be affected by any funding criterion relating to tumour size.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of New Zealand patients with refractory seizures related to TSC would be influenced by the number of previous antiepileptic treatments required to be trialled prior to mTOR therapy. Members noted PHARMAC staff estimated this group to be approximately 30 to 40 people per year, however, this would increase if the required number of previous antiepileptic treatments were reduced, or would reduce if there was overlap between the group of people with refractory seizures and those with other clinically significant complications associated with TSC.</p><p><i>Class effect</i></p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there are no head-to-head studies comparing everolimus with sirolimus for TSC, however, the Committee consider it is likely that there is a class effect for these agents, with minimal difference in effect between the two mTOR inhibitors. Members noted that everolimus clinical trial data is more robust and includes three randomised controlled trials, whereas the evidence for sirolimus predominantly consists of case series, cohort studies and small studies.</p><p>3.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it is likely that the mTOR inhibitors would provide benefit to the main patient subgroups with TSC, in addition to the patient groups who have other complications associated with TSC.</p><p>3.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is the potential for long-term adverse events (AEs) resulting from immunosuppression due to mTOR inhibitors and that this would be especially relevant for young patients eg. commencing mTOR inhibitor treatment at 1 year of age or less, due to the risk of developing skin cancers, lymphoma and other types of cancer.</p><p>3.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the significant cost difference, with everolimus currently being more expensive, and suitability factors, such as availability in a liquid formulation, would be important considerations in funding an mTOR inhibitor for this patient group.</p><p><i>Refractory seizures associated with TSC</i></p><p>3.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from the phase 3, double blind, randomised (1:1:1), placebo-controlled EXIST-3 trial comparing high exposure everolimus (9-15 ng/mL), low exposure everolimus (3-7 ng/mL), with placebo, in 366 patients with TSC and treatment-resistant seizures who were receiving between one and three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (French et al. Lancet. 2016:388;2153-63). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in seizure frequency during the 12-week maintenance period, defined as response rate (the proportion of patients achieving \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency) and median percentage reduction in seizure frequency.</p><p>3.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the response rate in the EXIST-3 trial was 40% with high exposure everolimus (95% CI: 31.5 to 49, P&lt;0.0001), 28.2% with low exposure everolimus (95% CI: 20.3 to 37.3, P=0.0077) and 15.1% with placebo (95% CI: 9.2 to 22.8). The Committee noted that after 18 weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency was 39.6% with high exposure everolimus (95% CI: 35.0 to 48.7), 29.3% with low dose everolimus (95% CI: 18.8 to 41.9) and 14.9% (95% CI: 0.1 to 21.7) with placebo.</p><p>3.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 24%, 18% and 11% of EXIST-3 trial patients who received high exposure, low exposure and placebo, respectively. The Committee noted that serious AEs were reported in 14% of patients in the high exposure group, 14% of patients in the low exposure group and 3% of patients in the placebo group.</p><p>3.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted the results of a post-hoc analysis of about 300 patients from the EXIST-3 trial, including 104 patients less than six years of age and 195 who were six years or older (Curatolo et al. Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2018;7:495-504). Members noted the response rates in younger patients who received high dose everolimus (59.5%, P=0.0003), low dose everolimus (30.3%, P=0.2245) or placebo (17.6%); and the response rates in older patients who received high dose everolimus (30.0%, P=0.0179), low dose everolimus (27.0%, P=0.0491) or placebo (12.9%).

However, on balance a pragmatic approach would be to include other complications in the group recommended for funding through the Pharmaceutical Schedule without detailing each potential complication.

Members noted everolimus for use in the treatment of SEGA associated with TSC is Medsafe approved, however approval has not been sought for everolimus in other TSC disease to date and these would be unapproved indications. Sirolimus is not approved for any TSC-related disorder in New Zealand, however the available formulations may make this a reasonable option. Members noted that there is a liquid formulation that would be suitable to use in children (sirolimus 1mg/ml oral solution); everolimus is only available in tablet form.

The Committee noted that the disease burden increases with age, complications can develop from birth or infancy, and the disease can manifest clinically in the brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, lungs, skin. Disease manifestations can also include impaired cognition, autism, and bipolar disorder. The Committee considered there is a significant unmet health need in patients with TSC but noted that there is minimal quality of life data available for this condition.

The Committee noted that renal angiomyolipomas are associated with impaired renal function and also that progressive enlargement is a risk factor for spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage and clinically significant haematuria. The Committee considered that patients with renal angiomyolipomas have a high health need due to impaired renal function and bleeding risk, although it is difficult to predict which patients may experience haemorrhage. Members noted clinical practice and treatment guidelines often consider larger tumours are more likely to bleed, however with limited supporting evidence, it is uncertain if this is the case.

The Committee noted that seizures, caused by benign brain lesions known as tubers, are present in 80 to 90% of patients with TSC before the age of 3 years. Seizure types vary, with infantile spasm being most common at diagnosis; however, focal, tonic-clonic and generalised onset seizures can also occur. The Committee considered that patients who have refractory seizures associated with TSC have a high health need due to the significant cognitive effects of the disease, and considered that parents, caregivers and family/wh\u0101nau of these patients may have a health need due to the impact of this disease in a young patient group.

The Committee noted that no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or nephrectomies were reported, and that the most common AEs suspected to be treatment-related were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia (30.4%), acne (25.9%), aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (each 21.4%).</p><p>3.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence from the EXIST-2 trial demonstrated that most patients had achieved responses to everolimus and that these were maintained, although it was unclear whether any reduction conveys clinical benefit or changes renal function. Members considered there is limited evidence that targeting treatment to those with larger angiomyolipoma (greater than 3 or 4 cm) leads to clinically significant outcomes for patients, however this seems likely. Members considered that angiomyolipomas regress in volume during everolimus treatment, but the EXIST-2 trial results suggested that the volume of angiomyolipomas was likely to increase if everolimus is discontinued.</p><p>3.30<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from the open-label, non-randomised study in 25 adults with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis who had at least one angiomyolipoma of 1cm in size, who received sirolimus dosing based on target blood levels (1-5 ng/mL) for 24 months to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume (Bissler et al. N Engl J Med. 2008:358;140-51). The Committee noted that the mean angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2% (\u00b126.6%) of the baseline value, and at 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in volume of 30% or more. The Committee noted that, at 6 to 12 months after stopping sirolimus, the mean angiomyolipoma volume had increased to 76.8% (\u00b127.5%) of the baseline volume.</p><p>3.31<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following open-label, phase II clinical trial evidence for sirolimus for the treatment of complications (including angiomyolipomas) associated with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Davies et al.

The Committee considered that the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma and other clinically significant complications resulting from TSC would be a long-term treatment and noted that there is no data to support intermittent use at this time. The Committee considered that the benefit of treatment would be determined through clinical and radiological improvements (reduction in tumour size, stabilisation or improvement in organ function) and quality of life improvement.</p><p><i>General</i></p><p>3.33<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that cost-effectiveness analysis of mTOR inhibitors for these indications should consider dose adjustments and quality of life improvements.</p><p>3.34<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a small number of patients with TSC would be excluded if funding criteria for mTOR inhibitors was targeted to only patients with renal angiomyolipoma(s) or refractory seizures. The Committee considered that this small group of patients, eg. those with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, would be expected to benefit from treatment with an mTOR inhibitor and that funding of treatment for such patients could be considered through the NPPA pathway. However, on balance a pragmatic approach would be to include other complications in the group recommended for funding through the Pharmaceutical Schedule without detailing each potential complication. The Committee considered that PHARMAC staff would need to estimate the maximum population of people with TSC that would be included in this broader definition in order to manage any fiscal risk of proposed patient group.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee noted that in addition to the applications received, PHARMAC requested the Committee particularly consider use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma and refractory seizures associated with TSC, noting there may also be a role for mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of other clinical complications of TSC.</p><p>3.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC has previously considered everolimus and sirolimus for renal angiomyolipoma(s) and refractory seizures associated with TSC through the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) process for a small number of patients.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that everolimus has FDA approval for use in treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC and other TSC disease, but sirolimus is not approved by the FDA for this indication. Members noted everolimus for use in the treatment of SEGA associated with TSC is Medsafe approved, however approval has not been sought for everolimus in other TSC disease to date and these would be unapproved indications. Sirolimus is not approved for any TSC-related disorder in New Zealand, however the available formulations may make this a reasonable option. Members noted that there is a liquid formulation that would be suitable to use in children (sirolimus 1mg/ml oral solution); everolimus is only available in tablet form. Both everolimus and sirolimus are listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for other funded indications. Members noted that treatment is continued indefinitely for these funded indications, if the treatment is effective.</p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that TSC is a genetic disorder characterised by the development of benign tumour-like malformations in multiple organ systems; 80% of these mutations occur de novo, with the remainder inherited. The Committee noted that the disease burden increases with age, complications can develop from birth or infancy, and the disease can manifest clinically in the brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, lungs, skin. Disease manifestations can also include impaired cognition, autism, and bipolar disorder. The Committee considered there is a significant unmet health need in patients with TSC but noted that there is minimal quality of life data available for this condition. Members considered that in the later stages of disease, there is increased health need due to respiratory failure.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that development of renal angiomyolipomas is a common, clinically significant complication in TSC, the prevalence of which increases with age. The Committee noted that renal angiomyolipomas are associated with impaired renal function and also that progressive enlargement is a risk factor for spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage and clinically significant haematuria. The Committee considered that patients with renal angiomyolipomas have a high health need due to impaired renal function and bleeding risk, although it is difficult to predict which patients may experience haemorrhage. Members noted clinical practice and treatment guidelines often consider larger tumours are more likely to bleed, however with limited supporting evidence, it is uncertain if this is the case. The Committee considered that the families/wh\u0101nau of patients with renal angiomyolipomas may have additional health needs if a patient\u2019s disease results in renal failure.</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that epilepsy is one of the most frequent and significant causes of morbidity in TSC and is often the presenting symptom. The Committee noted that seizures, caused by benign brain lesions known as tubers, are present in 80 to 90% of patients with TSC before the age of 3 years. Seizure types vary, with infantile spasm being most common at diagnosis; however, focal, tonic-clonic and generalised onset seizures can also occur. The Committee considered that patients who have refractory seizures associated with TSC have a high health need due to the significant cognitive effects of the disease, and considered that parents, caregivers and family/wh\u0101nau of these patients may have a health need due to the impact of this disease in a young patient group. Members considered that about two-thirds of patients with TSC and epilepsy use three or more antiepileptic medications, and about 25% have neurosurgical treatment.</p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is no data to indicate the M\u0101ori are disproportionately affected by TSC.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the patient group with non-seizure related complications of TSC is likely relatively small, around 20 patients per year. However, there is uncertainty regarding how many people would experience more than one complication of TSC and require treatment with an mTOR inhibitor. Members noted that PHARMAC staff estimates were based on uptake of everolimus use in Australia for renal angiomyolipoma which would be affected by any funding criterion relating to tumour size.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of New Zealand patients with refractory seizures related to TSC would be influenced by the number of previous antiepileptic treatments required to be trialled prior to mTOR therapy. Members noted PHARMAC staff estimated this group to be approximately 30 to 40 people per year, however, this would increase if the required number of previous antiepileptic treatments were reduced, or would reduce if there was overlap between the group of people with refractory seizures and those with other clinically significant complications associated with TSC.</p><p><i>Class effect</i></p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there are no head-to-head studies comparing everolimus with sirolimus for TSC, however, the Committee consider it is likely that there is a class effect for these agents, with minimal difference in effect between the two mTOR inhibitors. Members noted that everolimus clinical trial data is more robust and includes three randomised controlled trials, whereas the evidence for sirolimus predominantly consists of case series, cohort studies and small studies.</p><p>3.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it is likely that the mTOR inhibitors would provide benefit to the main patient subgroups with TSC, in addition to the patient groups who have other complications associated with TSC.</p><p>3.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is the potential for long-term adverse events (AEs) resulting from immunosuppression due to mTOR inhibitors and that this would be especially relevant for young patients eg. commencing mTOR inhibitor treatment at 1 year of age or less, due to the risk of developing skin cancers, lymphoma and other types of cancer.</p><p>3.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the significant cost difference, with everolimus currently being more expensive, and suitability factors, such as availability in a liquid formulation, would be important considerations in funding an mTOR inhibitor for this patient group.</p><p><i>Refractory seizures associated with TSC</i></p><p>3.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from the phase 3, double blind, randomised (1:1:1), placebo-controlled EXIST-3 trial comparing high exposure everolimus (9-15 ng/mL), low exposure everolimus (3-7 ng/mL), with placebo, in 366 patients with TSC and treatment-resistant seizures who were receiving between one and three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (French et al. Lancet. 2016:388;2153-63). The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in seizure frequency during the 12-week maintenance period, defined as response rate (the proportion of patients achieving \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency) and median percentage reduction in seizure frequency.</p><p>3.17<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the response rate in the EXIST-3 trial was 40% with high exposure everolimus (95% CI: 31.5 to 49, P&lt;0.0001), 28.2% with low exposure everolimus (95% CI: 20.3 to 37.3, P=0.0077) and 15.1% with placebo (95% CI: 9.2 to 22.8). The Committee noted that after 18 weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency was 39.6% with high exposure everolimus (95% CI: 35.0 to 48.7), 29.3% with low dose everolimus (95% CI: 18.8 to 41.9) and 14.9% (95% CI: 0.1 to 21.7) with placebo.</p><p>3.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 24%, 18% and 11% of EXIST-3 trial patients who received high exposure, low exposure and placebo, respectively. The Committee noted that serious AEs were reported in 14% of patients in the high exposure group, 14% of patients in the low exposure group and 3% of patients in the placebo group.</p><p>3.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members noted the results of a post-hoc analysis of about 300 patients from the EXIST-3 trial, including 104 patients less than six years of age and 195 who were six years or older (Curatolo et al. Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2018;7:495-504). Members noted the response rates in younger patients who received high dose everolimus (59.5%, P=0.0003), low dose everolimus (30.3%, P=0.2245) or placebo (17.6%); and the response rates in older patients who received high dose everolimus (30.0%, P=0.0179), low dose everolimus (27.0%, P=0.0491) or placebo (12.9%). Members considered that the other results reported by the authors, including median reduction in seizure frequency, sustained seizure reduction after 1 year and median percentage reduction in seizure frequency, were very consistent.</p><p>3.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted evidence from a randomised, controlled clinical trial of sirolimus for the treatment of intractable epilepsy in children with TSC (Overwater et al. Neurology. 2016:87;1011-8).</p><p>3.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a systematic review of mTOR inhibitors suggests that there is a reduction in seizure frequency associated with use of these agents (Li M et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2019;14:39).</p><p>3.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of refractory seizures associated with TSC may result in additional AEs compared to other available treatment options.</p><p>3.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of refractory seizures associated with TSC would be an ongoing, indefinite treatment. The Committee considered that the group of patients with TSC who have treatment-resistant epilepsy and have previously trialled a number of pharmaceutical treatments for epilepsy would be those most likely to receive the greatest benefit from mTOR inhibitors. The Committee considered that the benefit of treatment would be determined through a reduction in seizure frequency eg. 50% reduction from pre-mTOR treatment baseline, and improvement in quality of life of the patient and that of their family/wh\u0101nau. Members noted some patients may go on to receive surgery, however, shrinking the tumour (with mTOR treatment) prior to surgery would be beneficial.</p><p>3.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the proposed funding criteria included prior use of six anti-epileptic medications, however, the clinical trial evidence only required a past trial of three medications. The Committee considered that it would require significant time for a trial six anti-epileptic medications and that this could delay use of, and consequently the benefits from, mTOR inhibitors.</p><p>3.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that specific advice eg. from neurologists may be needed to determine an appropriate number of previous anti-epileptic medications for the initial funding criteria, and to identify appropriate measures and increments of quality of life improvement for inclusion in the renewal criteria. The Committee considered that the evidence did not suggest any difference in clinical benefit according to patient age, therefore there is no rationale to include age in the funding criteria.</p><p><i>Clinically significant complications resulting from TSC (including renal angiomyolipoma)</i></p><p>3.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from the phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXIST-2 trial comparing oral everolimus (10 mg per day) to placebo in 118 adult patients with at least one 3cm or greater angiomyolipoma, with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Bissler et al. Lancet. 2013:381;817-24). The Committee noted that the angiomyolipoma response rate was 42% with everolimus (95% CI: 31-53%) and 0% with placebo (0-9%) after median follow-up of 34 and 38 weeks for placebo and everolimus, respectively. The Committee noted that the most commonly reported AEs were stomatitis, nasopharyngitis and acne-like skin lesions.</p><p>3.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from the long-term, open-label follow-up of 112 patients from the EXIST-2 trial who received everolimus continued at the same dose, or everolimus started at a dose of 10 mg per day in patients who previously received placebo (Bissler et al. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2016:31;111-9). The Committee noted that after median medication exposure of 28.9 months, the response rate in 107 patients with angiomyolipoma was 54% and that the proportions of patients achieving angiomyolipoma reductions of 30% or greater and 50% or greater increased over time, reaching 81.6% (62/76) and 64.5% (49/76) by week 96. The Committee noted that no renal bleeding events were reported in everolimus-treated patients, no new safety issues were identified, and the long-term safety profile was consistent with previous reports.</p><p>3.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from the four-year, open-label follow-up of 112 patients from the EXIST-2 trial who received everolimus 10 mg per day, or similar tolerated dose, for up to four years (Bissler et al. PLoS One. 2017:12(8): e0180939). The Committee noted that, after median 46.9 months duration of exposure to everolimus, 58% of patients (95% CI: 48.3% - 67.3%) achieved angiomyolipoma response and 14.3% (16) of patients experienced angiomyolipoma progression at some point in the study. The Committee noted that no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or nephrectomies were reported, and that the most common AEs suspected to be treatment-related were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia (30.4%), acne (25.9%), aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (each 21.4%).</p><p>3.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence from the EXIST-2 trial demonstrated that most patients had achieved responses to everolimus and that these were maintained, although it was unclear whether any reduction conveys clinical benefit or changes renal function. Members considered there is limited evidence that targeting treatment to those with larger angiomyolipoma (greater than 3 or 4 cm) leads to clinically significant outcomes for patients, however this seems likely. Members considered that angiomyolipomas regress in volume during everolimus treatment, but the EXIST-2 trial results suggested that the volume of angiomyolipomas was likely to increase if everolimus is discontinued.</p><p>3.30<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from the open-label, non-randomised study in 25 adults with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis who had at least one angiomyolipoma of 1cm in size, who received sirolimus dosing based on target blood levels (1-5 ng/mL) for 24 months to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume (Bissler et al. N Engl J Med. 2008:358;140-51). The Committee noted that the mean angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2% (\u00b126.6%) of the baseline value, and at 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in volume of 30% or more. The Committee noted that, at 6 to 12 months after stopping sirolimus, the mean angiomyolipoma volume had increased to 76.8% (\u00b127.5%) of the baseline volume.</p><p>3.31<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the following open-label, phase II clinical trial evidence for sirolimus for the treatment of complications (including angiomyolipomas) associated with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Davies et al.

The Committee considered that the use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma and other clinically significant complications resulting from TSC would be a long-term treatment and noted that there is no data to support intermittent use at this time. The Committee considered that the benefit of treatment would be determined through clinical and radiological improvements (reduction in tumour size, stabilisation or improvement in organ function) and quality of life improvement.</p><p><i>General</i></p><p>3.33<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that cost-effectiveness analysis of mTOR inhibitors for these indications should consider dose adjustments and quality of life improvements.</p><p>3.34<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that a small number of patients with TSC would be excluded if funding criteria for mTOR inhibitors was targeted to only patients with renal angiomyolipoma(s) or refractory seizures. The Committee considered that this small group of patients, eg. those with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, would be expected to benefit from treatment with an mTOR inhibitor and that funding of treatment for such patients could be considered through the NPPA pathway. However, on balance a pragmatic approach would be to include other complications in the group recommended for funding through the Pharmaceutical Schedule without detailing each potential complication. The Committee considered that PHARMAC staff would need to estimate the maximum population of people with TSC that would be included in this broader definition in order to manage any fiscal risk of proposed patient group.\u00a0</p>",
