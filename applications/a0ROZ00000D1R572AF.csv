The Committees noted that an episome is formed and therefore there is minimal evidence of integration into the human genome. In addition, the Committees noted that <em>SMN</em> expression is in the motor neurones and peripheral tissues, with onasemnogene abeparvovec able to cross the blood brain barrier.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that onasemnogene abeparvovec is currently undergoing initial evaluation by Medsafe for regulatory approval.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1706198"" target=""_blank"">Mendell J.R. et al, N Engl J Med. 2017 2;377:1713-22</a> study that reported the findings from the START trial, a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study. The study enrolled individuals who had SMA type 1 with 2 copies of SMN2 gene. A total of 15 were treated, with 12 administered the therapeutic dose and 3 the subtherapeutic dose. The primary objective was safety, and 56 serious adverse events were reported in 13 people. There were 2 treatment related grade 4 events, and 4 individuals had an increase in aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase which were successfully treated with prednisolone. Secondary objectives were time to death or permanent ventilation, with no individual requiring permanent ventilatory assistance, 1 in the subtherapeutic dose required permanent ventilation due to hypersalivation. Non-invasive ventilation was reduced by 25% to 15 hours per day after salivary-gland ligation. In the subtherapeutic dose group there was a mean increase of 7.7 points from a baseline of 16.3 in The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score, whilst in the high dose group there was a 24.6-point mean increase from baseline of 28.2. In the therapeutic dose cohort 11/12 could sit unassisted ≥5 seconds, n=10 for ≥10 seconds, and n=9 for ≥30 seconds. A total of 11 individuals achieved head control, 9 could roll over, and 2 could crawl, pull to stand, stand independently, and walk independently. In the study, 11 attained the ability to speak, whilst 7/12 were independent of ventilatory assistance at the last follow-up visit compared to 10/12 at baseline. A total of 11/12 achieved or retained the ability to swallow independently, and 4 were able to feed orally. The Committees considered the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6590370/"" target=""_blank"">Al-Zaidy S et al, Pediatr Pulmonol. 2019;54:179-85</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8129901/"" target=""_blank"">Mendell et al, JAMA Neurol. 2021;78:834-41</a> studies that provided 2 and 5 year follow up data respectively. All individuals who continued to 5 years (n=13) were alive without the need for permanent ventilation. All individuals (n=10) maintained previously acquired motor milestones, whilst 2 achieved new standing with assistance. Severe adverse events occurred in 8 individuals (62%), including acute respiratory failure (31%), pneumonia (31%), dehydration (23%), respiratory distress (15%) and bronchiolitis (15%). At 5 years post dosing, 7/13 were receiving concomitant nusinersen, including 3 who received a subtherapeutic dose and 4 who received the therapeutic dose, to maximise benefit.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277975/"" target=""_blank"">Lowes et al, Pediatr Neurol. 2019;98:39-4</a> study, which provided further analysis from the START trial. Children were grouped by age at dosing as well as baseline CHOP-Intend scores. The study reported that those with lower CHOP-Intend scores, who were dosed earlier, had greater increases in mean points gained (35 points improvement from a mean baseline of 15.7). Those that had later dosing had a mean gain of 23.3 points (from a mean baseline of 26.5), whilst those who had higher CHOP-Intend scores but were dosed earlier quickly reached a mean score of 60.3 points, near the scale maximum (64), from a mean baseline of 44.0.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the STR1VE US (n=22, treated at aged less than 6 months) and EU (n=32 study aged less than 6 months) studies reported in <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442221000016?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"">Day et al, Lancet Neurol. 2021;20:284-293</a> and <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536405/"" target=""_blank"">Mercuri et al, Lancet Neurol. 2021;20:832-41</a> respectively. The Committees noted that these were both phase 3, open label, single-arm studies in those with SMA type 1, with two copies of the <em>SMN2</em> gene. The Committees noted that there were subtle differences in the eligibility criteria, with the population enrolled on the EU trial more symptomatic, and therefore recording lower baseline CHOP-INTEND scores. The Committees noted that the 2 trials were therefore not directly comparable. The Committees noted that all people who were enrolled improved from their baseline scores, however the EU cohort showed a lower improvement which was hypothesised to be due to the EU individuals having a lower CHOP-INTEND scores at enrolment. In those in the US study 59% (13/22) could sit for greater than 30 seconds, whilst 91% survived free from permanent ventilation at 18 months and 14 months post dosing respectively. In the EU study 44% (14/32) could sit for greater than 10 seconds and 97% survived free from permanent ventilatory support at 18 and 14 months respectively. The study reported 3 serious adverse events that were related or possibly related to treatment in the US, whilst there were 6 in the EU cohort.

A total of 79% of children stood alone, whilst 50% stood within the normal developmental window of ≤514 days. All survived without permanent ventilation. A total of 13 (93%) treated maintained weight at or above the third percentile without non-oral/mechanical feeding support up to 18 months of age.

The study was a phase 3, multicentre, single-arm trial in those with pre-symptomatic SMA with 3 copies of the <em>SMN2</em> gene (n=15). All those enrolled were alive and free from permanent ventilation. Similarly, all enrolled stood for ≥3\u2009seconds at any visit up to 24\u2009months of age and maintained the milestone until the 24-month visit. At the 24 months study visit, 14 (93%) walked independently for at least five steps.

A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review, and 4 in the meta-analyses. The analysis found that onasemnogene abeparvovec improved CHOP-INTEND scores by 11.06 (9.47, 12.65) and 14.14 (12.42, 15.86) points at 3- and 6-months post-infusion, respectively. A total of 87%, 51%, and 12% achieved CHOP-INTEND scores of &gt;40, &gt;50, and &gt;58/60 points, respectively. However, this proportion increased to 100% in pre-symptomatic participants with greater baseline CHOP-INTEND.

The study was a phase 3, multicentre, single-arm trial in those with pre-symptomatic SMA with 3 copies of the <em>SMN2</em> gene (n=15). All those enrolled were alive and free from permanent ventilation. Similarly, all enrolled stood for ≥3\u2009seconds at any visit up to 24\u2009months of age and maintained the milestone until the 24-month visit. At the 24 months study visit, 14 (93%) walked independently for at least five steps. Each child had ≥ 1 treatment emergent adverse event, and 3 had a treatment emergent adverse event reported as serious.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered a meta-analysis from <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36136906/"" target=""_blank"">Pascual-Morena et al, Hum Gene Ther. 2022</a> that analysed data to estimate the effect of onasemnogene abeparvovec on motor function in participants with type 1 SMA.
