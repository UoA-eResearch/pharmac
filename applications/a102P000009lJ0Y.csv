The Subcommittee considered that because some patients are taking biologic monotherapy and therefore have different prior csDMARD requirements, the actual number of new patients may be lower than this. The Subcommittee considered that if changes to joint counts, CRP and prior csDMARDs were all implemented, this may be associated with a substantial increase in the number of patients initiating biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Patient-reported outcomes</u></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the applicant’s rationale for inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the Special Authority criteria was to align with EULAR and ACR guidelines.

The Subcommittee considered it was unclear as to the extent to which a functional change (ie reduction in HAQ-DI) would not be captured in improvement in disease activity. The Subcommittee considered it would be unusual that disease activity would remain high but that the patient experiences significant functional improvements. The Subcommittee considered it was not immediately clear what the driver would be for patients to see an improvement in HAQ-DI without a reduction in swollen joint count, and that this could reflect changes in health-related quality of life independent of biologic treatment. However, the Subcommittee considered the time for inflammation to significantly reduce is variable across patients, and that functional improvements may be seen before inflammation significantly reduced.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.28.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered concomitant disease, among other factors, would influence function and influence the reported HAQ-DI changes.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.29.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the HAQ-DI questionnaire includes questions on twenty areas, and considered this would be a considerable administrative burden to both clinicians and patients.

The Subcommittee considered the evidence did not provide a clear conclusion on the effect of two versus three csDMARDs on biologic efficacy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered the treat-to target-strategy in RA is agnostic on which pharmaceutical agent to use; the achievement of low disease activity is more important than the agent used to accomplish it. The Subcommittee considered that, while the likelihood of achieving the treatment target was lower with a third csDMARD than biologic treatment, that there was still a reasonable probability that a third csDMARD would achieve low disease activity. The Subcommittee considered it was likely at least 20% of patients would achieve low disease activity long-term on a third csDMARD and not require biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered there were differences in treatment approaches between clinicians in the combination and order of agents used when treating RA. Some members considered that leflunomide is associated with a number of tolerability issues and, if the requirement to trial three csDMARDs was reduced to two, that triple therapy (ie oral or parenteral methotrexate in combination with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine sulphate) should remain a requirement (if tolerated). The Subcommittee considered it important to leave agent flexibility for clinicians in order to support patients in achieving the best outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee suggested PHARMAC staff intended to remove the reference to intramuscular gold from the Special Authority, following its delisting from the Pharmaceutical Schedule.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.25.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if 20% of patients would otherwise achieve low disease activity on a third csDMARD, reducing the requirement to trial three csDMARDs down to two would result in a maximum of 120 additional patients per year on first line biologic treatment. The Subcommittee considered that because some patients are taking biologic monotherapy and therefore have different prior csDMARD requirements, the actual number of new patients may be lower than this. The Subcommittee considered that if changes to joint counts, CRP and prior csDMARDs were all implemented, this may be associated with a substantial increase in the number of patients initiating biologic treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Patient-reported outcomes</u></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the applicant’s rationale for inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the Special Authority criteria was to align with EULAR and ACR guidelines. The application noted the <a href=""https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/assets/docs/haq_instructions_508.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index</a> (HAQ-DI) has extensive validation and widespread use.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered it was clear from RCTs that HAQ-DI scores do improve in response to TNF inhibitor treatment, however noted an average change of 0.22 (which is often considered a ‘meaningful reduction’) was also observed in placebo groups. The Subcommittee considered it was unclear as to the extent to which a functional change (ie reduction in HAQ-DI) would not be captured in improvement in disease activity. The Subcommittee considered it would be unusual that disease activity would remain high but that the patient experiences significant functional improvements. The Subcommittee considered it was not immediately clear what the driver would be for patients to see an improvement in HAQ-DI without a reduction in swollen joint count, and that this could reflect changes in health-related quality of life independent of biologic treatment. However, the Subcommittee considered the time for inflammation to significantly reduce is variable across patients, and that functional improvements may be seen before inflammation significantly reduced.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.28.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered concomitant disease, among other factors, would influence function and influence the reported HAQ-DI changes.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.29.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the HAQ-DI questionnaire includes questions on twenty areas, and considered this would be a considerable administrative burden to both clinicians and patients. The Subcommittee considered the largest impact would be on primary care, as patients with stable disease are primarily managed by their GP. The Subcommittee considered the questionnaire burden may act as an access barrier for some patients.</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000D2bXQAS'}, 'change': None}]",Mar 2020,False,True
