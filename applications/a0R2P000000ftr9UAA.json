The Committee considered that M\u0101ori have higher rates of heart disease and have higher exposure to cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking and obesity. The Committee considered although del-Nido solution was not a direct component in reduction of cardiovascular and cardiac risk factors it could be used in the surgical treatment of heart disease that disproportionately affects M\u0101ori.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cardioplegia is an electrolyte solution that is used to maintain cardiac arrest, prevent dysrhythmias, avoid myocardial necrosis, deliver substrates, and wash away metabolic waste. The Committee noted that del-Nido solution is a blood cardioplegia, which is superior to crystalloid solutions. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that del-Nido cardioplegia solution is used to induce stasis in the myocardium during cardiac surgery and is currently funded in hospitals as it is able to be extemporaneously compounded from funded components. The Committee noted that this application was for an additional listing for Biomed\u2019s formulation of del-Nido solution as it was not funded as an extemporaneously compounded product when purchased from a manufacturer. </p><h2><strong>Health need</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that although there was no unmet health need for this application, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples have higher rates of heart disease and have higher exposure to cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking and obesity. The Committee considered although del-Nido solution was not a direct component in reduction of cardiovascular and cardiac risk factors it could be used in the surgical treatment of heart disease that disproportionately affects M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that del-Nido solution is a long acting cardioplegia with a duration of effect of 90 minutes compared to 20 minutes for the commonly used Buckberg solution. The Committee considered the benefit of del-Nido solution to be a reduction in the frequency of re-infusion of the cardioplegia and a decrease in cross-clamp time. The Committee considered that outcomes such as reductions in postoperative, atrial fibrillation, renal failure or low left ventricular ejection fraction did not have a strong association with decreased cross-clamp time, although noting evidence that cross-clamp time under 150 minutes may be associated with a lower risk of postoperative events (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007817/\" target=\"_blank\">Nissinen et al. Perfusion 24 (5): 297-305</a>). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the wash out period required for del-Nido solution would be longer than shorter acting cardioplegia. The Committee considered that duration of effect is a factor in the selection of cardioplegia solution and depends on the pathology and nature of the surgery as the complexity affects the ability of the solution to reach the target areas in the heart. The Committee considered that such factors would be considered by the clinicians involved in the procedure to make an appropriate choice for the individual they are treating. </p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the current stability of the extemporaneous product was one month stored at 2-8 \u2070C. The Committee noted that the application was for del-Nido solution produced by Biomed with a 6-month expiry and able to be stored at room temperature. The Committee noted that this was not a Medsafe approved product and if funded would be supplied under Section 29. The Committee considered that previous recommendations for other therapeutics were subject to Medsafe approval however, considered that manufacturers of product are unlikely to seek Medsafe approval. The Committee considered the risk of using an unregistered product to be low for those likely to be using this product.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that it has been difficult for hospitals to predict the amount of del-Nido solution stock that might be required over the past few years as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted surgical operating times. The Committee considered a longer expiry could help mitigate this issue. The Committee considered there would be less waste, reduced time needed for compounding and easier storage with the 6-month expiry product. The Committee considered that this solved a Te Whatu Ora infrastructure problem addressing both storage and time needed to compound issues. </p><h2><strong>Cost and savings</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that an additional 10 minutes per hour of direct surgery time was saved using del-Nido (long acting) cardioplegia but considered that total time in theatre is impacted by many additional factors (preparation time, anaesthesia time, surgical team availability, blood testing delays, equipment function etc) and the impact of use of del-Nido solution on total theatre time is likely to be minimal. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that use of del-Nido cardioplegia with longer duration storage time would largely be confined to a subset of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, mainly in the Auckland and Waikato Te Whatu Ora districts. The Committee considered solution availability and familiarity could result in more widespread use over time. The Committee considered that del-Nido cardioplegia is not currently used for paediatric or adult congenital cardiac surgery, and current use was mainly in the adult non-congenital cardiac surgical setting. The Committee considered that del-Nido cardioplegia would be an additional option to the currently available cardioplegia solutions and may not be the preferred cardioplegia in all Te Whatu Ora districts. </p><h2><strong>Summary for assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for Biomed\u2019s del-Nido solution if it were to be funded in New Zealand for induction of cardiac stasis during cardiac surgery. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Committee considered that M\u0101ori have higher rates of heart disease and have higher exposure to cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking and obesity. The Committee considered although del-Nido solution was not a direct component in reduction of cardiovascular and cardiac risk factors it could be used in the surgical treatment of heart disease that disproportionately affects M\u0101ori.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cardioplegia is an electrolyte solution that is used to maintain cardiac arrest, prevent dysrhythmias, avoid myocardial necrosis, deliver substrates, and wash away metabolic waste. The Committee noted that del-Nido solution is a blood cardioplegia, which is superior to crystalloid solutions. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that del-Nido cardioplegia solution is used to induce stasis in the myocardium during cardiac surgery and is currently funded in hospitals as it is able to be extemporaneously compounded from funded components. The Committee noted that this application was for an additional listing for Biomed\u2019s formulation of del-Nido solution as it was not funded as an extemporaneously compounded product when purchased from a manufacturer. </p><h2><strong>Health need</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that although there was no unmet health need for this application, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples have higher rates of heart disease and have higher exposure to cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking and obesity. The Committee considered although del-Nido solution was not a direct component in reduction of cardiovascular and cardiac risk factors it could be used in the surgical treatment of heart disease that disproportionately affects M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that del-Nido solution is a long acting cardioplegia with a duration of effect of 90 minutes compared to 20 minutes for the commonly used Buckberg solution. The Committee considered the benefit of del-Nido solution to be a reduction in the frequency of re-infusion of the cardioplegia and a decrease in cross-clamp time. The Committee considered that outcomes such as reductions in postoperative, atrial fibrillation, renal failure or low left ventricular ejection fraction did not have a strong association with decreased cross-clamp time, although noting evidence that cross-clamp time under 150 minutes may be associated with a lower risk of postoperative events (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007817/\" target=\"_blank\">Nissinen et al.

The Committee considered that duration of effect is a factor in the selection of cardioplegia solution and depends on the pathology and nature of the surgery as the complexity affects the ability of the solution to reach the target areas in the heart. The Committee considered that such factors would be considered by the clinicians involved in the procedure to make an appropriate choice for the individual they are treating. </p><h2><strong>Suitability</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the current stability of the extemporaneous product was one month stored at 2-8 \u2070C. The Committee noted that the application was for del-Nido solution produced by Biomed with a 6-month expiry and able to be stored at room temperature. The Committee noted that this was not a Medsafe approved product and if funded would be supplied under Section 29.
