The Committee considered that fixed-duration therapies should be considered for funding as they provide good outcomes with more predictable cost than continuous therapies such as BTKis. The Committee considered that there was currently no evidence to suggest that continuous therapy resulted in superior outcomes compared to fixed term therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the health need of individuals with CLL has been well established and widely discussed at previous PTAC and CTAC meetings, including discussion in the context of various treatments in both the treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory (R/R) settings.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there was currently a high unmet health need in the first-line treatment of CLL with 17p del/ TP53 mut in New Zealand, who do poorly with chemo-immunotherapy based regiments and currently have no BTK inhibitor funded for this line of treatment.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that an increase in CLL registration in New Zealand may reflect the ageing population, and possibly increased rates of diagnosis, but that an increase in individual registrations would not necessarily correlate with increased treatment requirements. The Committee considered that the number if people requiring treatment in all four indications could be estimated by analysing Special Authority individual numbers in the first instance, with reference to the supplier estimates if required. The Committee considered that 10% was a reasonable estimate of the proportion of people with newly diagnosed CLL who have 17p del/TP53 mutation but that a higher proportion may have these mutations in the subgroups who access treatment at each successive treatment line.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results of the SEQUOIA trial (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054121/"" target=""_blank"">Tam et al.

The Committee noted that efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and complete response rate (CR). The Committee noted the following results: PFS: 88.9% (95% CI:81.3,93.6) at 24 months, ORR: 99/110 (90.0%) (95%CI:82.8-94.9), CR: 7(95%CI:2.6,12.7).

The Committee noted efficacy and safety results, including OR (investigator assessed): zanubrutinib 83.5%, ibrutinib 74.2%, 24-month, event-free response investigator assessed: zanubrutinib 79.5%, ibrutinib 71.3%, 24-month PFS zanubrutinib 78.4% (95% CI, 73.3 to 82.7), ibrutinib 65.9% (95% CI, 60.1 to 71.1), atrial fibrillation/flutter: lower in the zanubrutinib group (in 17 of 324 [5.2%] vs. 43 of 324 [13.3%] in the ibrutinib group).</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was a class-effect for efficacy of BTK inhibitors including zanubrutinib and ibrutinib. The Committee referred to the ELEVATE (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305093/"" target=""_blank"">Sharman et al.

J Clin Oncol. 2023;41:1035-45</a>) trials as evidence indicating this class effect. The Committee considered that zanubrutinib would provide similar health benefit to ibrutinib for the lines of treatment where ibrutinib is already funded, due to this class effect. The Committee considered that for this reason, the same economic modelling for ibrutinib could be used for zanubrutinib for all indications, with ibrutinib as an equally efficacious comparator to zanubrutinib in indications where ibrutinib is funded. The Committee noted that zanubrutinib may be slightly more efficacious and cause fewer cardiac adverse events, but that these differences were likely insufficient to warrant separate economic modelling.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the strength of evidence for BTK inhibitors including zanubrutinib and ibrutinib to be good.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there were several reasons a BTK inhibitor may provide additional health benefit compared to venetoclax monotherapy for the treatment of previously untreated CLL with 17p del/ TP53 mut, as reflected in the SEQUOIA trial evidence, and via removing the need for hospital admission for tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis. The Committee also commented that this would align with international guidelines.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee reiterated its support for the <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2023</a> recommendation of removing the restriction on accessing usage\xa0of ibrutinib or venetoclax with rituximab to people who experienced a disease relapse within 36 months of prior line of treatment. The Committee considered that if a BTK inhibitor were to be funded for the first-line treatment of 17p-/del TP53mut CLL, then on progression these people who receive first-line BTK inhibitor treatment would then access venetoclax with rituximab as fixed duration therapy. Members considered that some haematology oncologists may prefer in 17p/TP53mut CLL to utilise venetoclax monotherapy upfront (first-line) and a BTK inhibitor on progression if venetoclax was only available once.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a BTK inhibitor would provide similar health benefit to venetoclax with rituximab for second-line treatment of CLL without 17p del/ TP53 mut, with the added health benefits of no hospital admission for tumour lysis syndrome prevention, and a full oral regimen.

The Committee noted that efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and complete response rate (CR). The Committee noted the following results: PFS: 88.9% (95% CI:81.3,93.6) at 24 months, ORR: 99/110 (90.0%) (95%CI:82.8-94.9), CR: 7(95%CI:2.6,12.7).

The Committee considered that zanubrutinib would provide similar health benefit to ibrutinib for the lines of treatment where ibrutinib is already funded, due to this class effect. The Committee considered that for this reason, the same economic modelling for ibrutinib could be used for zanubrutinib for all indications, with ibrutinib as an equally efficacious comparator to zanubrutinib in indications where ibrutinib is funded. The Committee noted that zanubrutinib may be slightly more efficacious and cause fewer cardiac adverse events, but that these differences were likely insufficient to warrant separate economic modelling.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the strength of evidence for BTK inhibitors including zanubrutinib and ibrutinib to be good.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there were several reasons a BTK inhibitor may provide additional health benefit compared to venetoclax monotherapy for the treatment of previously untreated CLL with 17p del/ TP53 mut, as reflected in the SEQUOIA trial evidence, and via removing the need for hospital admission for tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis. The Committee also commented that this would align with international guidelines.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee reiterated its support for the <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2023</a> recommendation of removing the restriction on accessing usage\xa0of ibrutinib or venetoclax with rituximab to people who experienced a disease relapse within 36 months of prior line of treatment. The Committee considered that if a BTK inhibitor were to be funded for the first-line treatment of 17p-/del TP53mut CLL, then on progression these people who receive first-line BTK inhibitor treatment would then access venetoclax with rituximab as fixed duration therapy. Members considered that some haematology oncologists may prefer in 17p/TP53mut CLL to utilise venetoclax monotherapy upfront (first-line) and a BTK inhibitor on progression if venetoclax was only available once.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a BTK inhibitor would provide similar health benefit to venetoclax with rituximab for second-line treatment of CLL without 17p del/ TP53 mut, with the added health benefits of no hospital admission for tumour lysis syndrome prevention, and a full oral regimen. The Committee estimated that if funded alongside venetoclax with rituximab there would be a 50/50 split across both therapies at both second and third line ie that half of people would receive a BTK inhibitor first followed by venetoclax, and half would receive it in the reverse order.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some people with CLL may prefer to receive a continuous oral regimen, especially if they were of older age, and therefore less likely to utilise later (three or more) lines of treatment. The Committee considered that due to prolonged progression free survival obtained with these oral regimens, some people of older age would not need to utilise further lines of therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Suitability</em></p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there do not appear to be any suitability issues relating to the use of zanubrutinib that have not been previously discussed in considerations of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib.</p><p><em>Cost and savings</em></p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that it was difficult to estimate the number of people who may discontinue continuous treatment if the 36-month Special Authority limitation were removed, but that on balance a broad estimate of 50% was not unreasonable, and this should be varied widely in sensitivity analysis (20-80%) and refined with further advice if highly material to economic modelling.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted that if the 36-month Special Authority restriction was removed for all BTK inhibitors, nobody would use obinutuzumab-chlorambucil at second-line. This change was made to the PICO table below.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that evidence of comparative efficacy for venetoclax monotherapy vs fixed duration venetoclax with rituximab in relapsed CLL with 17p deletion/TP53 mutation is lacking. There may be a preference among treaters for continuous therapy and therefore uptake for zanubrutinib for previously untreated CLL with 17p del/ TP53 mut would likely be high (perhaps 90+%) if venetoclax monotherapy was available second-line, and lower (perhaps closer to 70%) if venetoclax with rituximab was the only venetoclax-containing treatment available second-line.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that individuals whose disease progresses on a BTKi would be subsequently treated with another class of drug in preference to a second BTKi.

The Committee also considered 100% uptake would be likely if zanubrutinib were to be funded alongside venetoclax with rituximab for relapsed/refractory CLL without 17p del/TP53 mut due to the same benefits of zanubrutinib.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Funding criteria</em></p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The <span style=""color: black;"">Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for zanubrutinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CLL in the included indications.
