Members considered that individuals with overactive bladder are a broad group, and that this is an example of a normal physical process being medicalised and targeted, e.g. by direct advertising to consumers (DTCA) as requiring medical treatment, resulting in over-diagnosis (including self-diagnosis), both of which contribute to a risk of unnecessary overtreatment in this patient population.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that overactive bladder can affect family and whƒÅnau and noted evidence that suggests that overactive bladder patients who have cognitive impairment may have an increased likelihood of the need to move into a care facility (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18617737"" target=""_blank"">Luppa et al.

The Committee noted that the oxybutynin data sheet states that it should be used with caution in elderly patients who are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment due to oxybutynin (Source: <a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/a/Apooxybutynintabsyrup.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Apo-oxybutynin data sheet, March 2018</a>), and considered that clinical experience provides similar caution. The Committee was concerned that NHI-linked dispensing data indicate about 440 New Zealand patients receive both a cholinesterase inhibitor for dementia (rivastigmine or donepezil) and an anticholinergic for overactive bladder (oxybutynin, solifenacin or tolterodine). </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence for cognitive impairment due to anticholinergic treatment of overactive bladder to be sparse, confined to a follow-up of 69 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia receiving donepezil (of which 16 patients were on anticholinergic agents) which reported <span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">after 2 years </span>that Mini-Mental State Examination\xa0(MMSE)<span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""> scores were worse for patients receiving anticholinergics </span>(<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837675"" target=""_blank"">Lu et al.

The Committee noted that treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in a greater proportion of solifenacin patients (14.5%) than mirabegron patients (11.1%) in the BEYOND trial, including dry mouth (5.8% solifenacin compared with 3.1% mirabegron), and that patient reported outcomes (PRO) showed superiority of solifenacin in four out of five assessments.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results depicted for the randomised, phase II, double-blind, parallel, placebo and monotherapy-controlled Symphony trial of several dose schedules of solifenacin and mirabegron as monotherapy and in combinations for 12 weeks in 1,306 patients (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612659"" target=""_blank"">Abrams et al.

The Committee noted that the adjusted change in mean number of urgency episodes was reduced with 10 mg solifenacin and was slightly increased with 50 mg mirabegron.

The Committee noted that patients over 75 years of age had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, hypertension and discontinuation at 12 weeks with tolterodine and had higher rates of treatment-emergent AEs, discontinuations and serious AEs at 1 year with mirabegron 50 mg. </p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results of a phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1:1), active-controlled trial comparing 12 months‚Äô treatment with mirabegron (50 mg or 100 mg) or tolterodine 4 mg in 2,444 adult patients (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195283"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>In <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac‚Äôs assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual‚Äôs confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290.

The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual‚Äôs treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>In <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac‚Äôs assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual‚Äôs confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>).

The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual‚Äôs treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.

At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac‚Äôs assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual‚Äôs confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290.

However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual‚Äôs treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.

6,"<p>We refer to our decisions about whether and how particular pharmaceuticals are publicly-funded, as &ldquo;funding decisions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We consider and assess all funding decisions using the&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/about/operating-policies-and-procedures/#factorsfc"" rel=""nofollow"">Factors for Consideration</a>. When we do so, we carefully evaluate clinical and other evidence for the benefits and suitability of a proposal, and to identify and understand the people who will be affected by it.</p>
<p>While our main task is to allocate pharmaceutical funding, we consider the benefits and costs across the whole health system now and with a long-term focus, including the effects for hospitals and primary care, and consider direct costs to patients as well as to all health sector budgets.</p>
<p>Final funding decisions are made by the Pharmac Board or delegated to senior Pharmac staff as required by the Board.</p>
