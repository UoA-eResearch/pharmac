The Committee noted/considered in 2012 it was reported that, the prevalence of severe eczema was 0.8% in European, and 2.1% in M\u0101ori adolescents aged 13-14 years of age (based on 2001-2003 data). This data indicated that the prevalence of eczema in M\u0101ori was 2.6 times higher than that of European adolescents at that time. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23956963/\" target=\"_blank\">(Clayton et al. Asia Pac Allergy. 2013;3:161-178)</a> The Committee noted that although the study was not conducted in adults, it acknowledges that as many M\u0101ori are disproportionately affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, they may be less likely to have access to effective and sustained management of their condition, an inequitable situation that is not confined to tamariki - children alone. The Committee considered that some M\u0101ori may have manual labour focussed occupations, in particular involving wet-work (where hands do not stay dry) which is a risk factor for chronic hand eczema.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background</em></p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the currently funded topical corticosteroids on the Pharmaceutical Schedule, and that the topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also funded under Special Authority criteria specifically for facial and eyelid eczema respectively. The Special Authority criteria requires people to have at least one of the following contraindications to topical corticosteroids: periorificial dermatitis, rosacea, documented epidermal atrophy or documented allergy to topical corticosteroids. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Pharmac has also not previously received a funding application for any other treatments for severe chronic hand eczema in adults that is unresponsive to treatment with potent topical corticosteroids.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hand dermatitis can be classified into several subtypes, including atopic, hyperkeratotic, vesicular, nummular, and pulpitis; and that the types are all treated similarly. The Committee noted that symptoms of hand eczema include fissures on the hands, which can cause severe pain and lead to the person not being able to use their hands, both in their occupation and for tasks for daily living <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema?search=chronic%20hand%20eczema&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=1~11&amp;usage_type=default&amp;display_rank=1#H506386537\" target=\"_blank\">(Sheehan.

The Committee noted that hand eczema is a chronic condition which may continue for 5-10 years or longer, and so treatment may be needed over that length of time. The Committee considered that treatments should be added over time, rather than replaced, for example adding a systemic therapy whilst also continuing with topical treatments. </p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), is one of the ways the success of a treatment for hand eczema can be assessed with a decrease of at least 4 points being traditionally assessed as \u201ceffective\u201d. The Committee noted that a DLQI score of 15 being decreased to 11 still represents a significant impact upon the person\u2019s quality of life, so the goal of treatment is shifting to achieving a DLQI of &lt;5 going forward. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a United Kingdom (UK)-wide survey on the treatment of severe, chronic hand eczema (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27910127/\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. Clin Exp Dermatol. 2016;42:185-188</a>). The Committee noted that psoralen combined with ultraviolet A (PUVA) and alitretinoin were identified as the most frequent first line treatment options for hyperkeratotic hand eczema, whereas oral corticosteroids were identified as the most frequent first-line treatment for vesicular hand eczema, followed by PUVA and alitretinoin. The Committee noted that retinoids were effective in almost 60% of people, whereas PUVA was effective in 28% of people. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that alitretinoin is a retinoid (vitamin A derivative) which binds to several retinoid receptor subtypes, regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, reduces epidermal thickness, normalises the expression of some skin barrier genes, and has dermal immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties <a href=\"https://nzf.org.nz/nzf_6346\" target=\"_blank\">(New Zealand Formulary.

The Committee noted authors concluded that both treatments are effective options, but that fewer patients discontinued alitretinoin compared with acitretin due to adverse effects. The Committee considered that the result of most people discontinuing alitretinoin by 48 weeks may show that the condition cleared quicker than with acitretin. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The applicant noted results of the BACH trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18294310/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruzicka et al.

The Committee noted that at 24 weeks 47.7% patients taking 30mg alitretinoin group reported \u201cclear\u201d (22%) or \u201calmost clear\u201d (25.7%) physician global assessment (PGA) scores (P&lt;0.001) and the 10mg alitretinoin group had a response of 27.5% clear (9.3%) or almost clear (18.2%) (P=0.004).

J Eur Dermatol Venereol. 2020;34:4-12)</a> and members considered that approximately 1% was the most likely prevalence in New Zealand in their expert opinion.

J Eur Dermatol Venereol. 2020;34:4-12)</a>. The Committee considered that this is likely due to females being more likely to work in occupations involving wet-work.

The Committee considered that education on recommended hand-care, skin protection programmes, and avoidance of factors that contribute to hand eczema are important components of the hand eczema treatment paradigm. The Committee considered that emollients and silicon barriers on their own are often not sufficiently effective in treating hand eczema, and that topical steroids are required in most cases.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that other treatment options for hand eczema in New Zealand may include botulinum toxin A (Botox) (for hand eczema associated with hyperhidrosis, but not funded for this indication), and systemic therapies such as corticosteroids, methotrexate and ciclosporin. The Committee considered that phototherapy can be effective, but access is severely limited due to there being few phototherapy units across New Zealand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that goals of treatment included improving symptoms of the disease, restoring form and function of the hands, and ensuring the hands continue to remain clear of eczema. The Committee considered the importance of setting individualised goals for those affected, for example being able to wash one\u2019s hair without pain or being able to participate in sports activities. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the duration of treatment was dependent on the treatment being used and the individual circumstances of the person. The Committee noted that hand eczema is a chronic condition which may continue for 5-10 years or longer, and so treatment may be needed over that length of time. The Committee considered that treatments should be added over time, rather than replaced, for example adding a systemic therapy whilst also continuing with topical treatments. </p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), is one of the ways the success of a treatment for hand eczema can be assessed with a decrease of at least 4 points being traditionally assessed as \u201ceffective\u201d. The Committee noted that a DLQI score of 15 being decreased to 11 still represents a significant impact upon the person\u2019s quality of life, so the goal of treatment is shifting to achieving a DLQI of &lt;5 going forward. </p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results from a United Kingdom (UK)-wide survey on the treatment of severe, chronic hand eczema (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27910127/\" target=\"_blank\">Smith et al. Clin Exp Dermatol. 2016;42:185-188</a>). The Committee noted that psoralen combined with ultraviolet A (PUVA) and alitretinoin were identified as the most frequent first line treatment options for hyperkeratotic hand eczema, whereas oral corticosteroids were identified as the most frequent first-line treatment for vesicular hand eczema, followed by PUVA and alitretinoin. The Committee noted that retinoids were effective in almost 60% of people, whereas PUVA was effective in 28% of people. </p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that alitretinoin is a retinoid (vitamin A derivative) which binds to several retinoid receptor subtypes, regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, reduces epidermal thickness, normalises the expression of some skin barrier genes, and has dermal immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties <a href=\"https://nzf.org.nz/nzf_6346\" target=\"_blank\">(New Zealand Formulary.
