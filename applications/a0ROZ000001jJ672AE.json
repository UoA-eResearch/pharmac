The Committee noted that\u00a0the most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (65% palbociclib plus fulvestrant vs\u00a01% placebo plus fulvestrant), anaemia (3% vs 2%), and leukopenia (28% vs 1%).\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that at the time of the prespecified OS analysis of PALOMA-3\u00a0(median follow up 44.8 months), Turner et al. 2018 reported a median OS of 34.9 months\u00a0in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with 28.0 months in the placebo plus\u00a0fulvestrant group (stratified HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09). The Committee\u00a0noted that while this was not a statistically significant difference, the OS did favour\u00a0treatment with palbociclib plus fulvestrant (difference in OS of 6.9 months).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the QoL analysis from the PALOMA-3 trial, in which Harbeck et\u00a0al. 2016 reported that the estimated overall global QoL scores favoured the palbociclib\u00a0plus fulvestrant group compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant group (66.1 vs 63.0;\u00a0P=0.0313).

The Committee considered that these meta-analyses, in addition to\u00a0the Committee\u2019s review of the primary clinical trials of palbociclib and ribociclib, indicate\u00a0that there is a class effect with the CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that the agents within this\u00a0class can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic effect.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in April 2019, CaTSoP reviewed the evidence available to\u00a0date for the use of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib for the treatment of aBC\u00a0(publication of minutes pending). The Committee noted that based on this CaTSoP\u00a0considered there is a class effect with CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that there is likely to be no\u00a0significant difference in which endocrine partner the CDK4/6 inhibitors are combined\u00a0with.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available at this time regarding switching\u00a0between CDK4/6 inhibitors or continuing the same CDK4/6 inhibitor but switching the\u00a0endocrine partner at progression. The Committee noted that the PACE trial\u00a0(NCT03147287) and the TRINITI trial (NCT02732119) which are investigating the use\u00a0of CDK4/6 inhibitors following prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment are currently underway.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are a large number of trials underway investigating\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, including in different breast cancer subtypes, as\u00a0different treatment combinations, and for the treatment of different stages of breast\u00a0cancer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that there are a number of pharmacoeconomic analyses published\u00a0regarding the cost effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603995\" target=\"_blank\">Gogate et al.

The Committee\u00a0noted that these studies generally concluded that CDK4/6 inhibitors exceed willingness\u00a0to pay thresholds at the prices currently being offered. The Committee noted that the\u00a0pharmacoeconomic analyses that compared the cost effectiveness of ribociclib to\u00a0palbociclib found that ribociclib was a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib, noting that\u00a0these analyses are largely driven by the price offered in the country they were conducted\u00a0in (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799329\" target=\"_blank\">Mistry et al.

Ann Oncol. 2018;29:888-94</a>). The Committee noted that if a CDK4/6 inhibitor\u00a0were funded, there may be an increased requirement for the investigation and treatment\u00a0of neutropenia and so additional associated costs to the sector from this.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited OS data currently available for the use of\u00a0first line CDK4/6 inhibitors, and the OS data available to date for second line use of\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant difference compared with\u00a0placebo. The Committee noted CaTSoP\u2019s April 2019 discussion of the difficulties in\u00a0assessing OS in disease such as HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer where\u00a0patients have long survival times and receive multiple lines of treatment (CaTSoP April\u00a02019 - publication of minutes pending).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee noted that palbociclib plus fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of\u00a0HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC has a score of 4 on the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical\u00a0Benefit Scale; palbociclib or ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the first-line\u00a0treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC have scores of 3 on the ESMO-Magnitude\u00a0of Clinical Benefit Scale.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee considered that there is moderate quality evidence that palbociclib or\u00a0ribociclib used in combination with an endocrine partner as a first-line treatment provides\u00a0a modest improvement in PFS and maintains QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC. The Committee considered that while there are good quality Phase 3\u00a0randomized controlled trials available, that the interpretation of results is limited by the\u00a0</p><p>emphasis placed on PFS. The Committee considered that a composite analysis of PFS,\u00a0OS, safety, and QoL data would strengthen the evidence base.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is good quality evidence that palbociclib in\u00a0combination with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment provides a modest improvement\u00a0in PFS with maintenance of QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was uncertain whether the use of a CDK4/6 in a first or second-line setting would provide greater overall benefit for patients, as there was a\u00a0lack of evidence to inform whether these agents altered tumour biology and/or the\u00a0efficacy of subsequent treatments.

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting.

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting.

However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting. Although, members noted that this does not include those second-line patients with hormone sensitive disease where the data in this subgroup is considered to be stronger than in a general second-line population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated survival data for ribociclib from MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 reinforced the signal of a class effect from use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that benefit from use of CDK4/6 inhibitor has been demonstrated across both first and second-line populations. The Subcommittee considered that the differences in trial results is likely to have been driven by heterogeneity of the trial populations, such as the number of patients with endocrine-sensitive disease or ESR-1 mutation rates, although this was based on expert opinion and not supported by any current data.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a benefit from CDK4/6 inhibitors is reported in both first-line post-menopausal patients and first-line pre-menopausal patients treated with ovarian suppression with the strength of evidence best for those who receive aromatase inhibitor and goserelin. The Subcommittee considered that patients with hormone-sensitive disease appear to get the most benefit from use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a second-line setting; and that the durability of response for the overall second-line population is likely to be slightly shorter than when used in a first-line HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the various trials for use of the three CDK4/6 inhibitor agents with currently published evidence, the ribociclib trials were of highest quality due to their clinical trial design, which meant that OS could be demonstrated, whereas the survival data from the palbociclib and abemaciclib trials were compromised by the crossover design.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is good quality evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a PFS of around 10 to 12 months and around a 30% improvement in OS (in a disease setting where it is difficult to demonstrate OS gain) both of which were clinically meaningful for patients with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while improving OS is considered the most important therapeutic goal in advanced breast cancer, it has been difficult to demonstrate an OS advantage in clinical trials in advanced breast cancer populations and particularly in a first-line setting. The Subcommittee considered this is both because powering studies to show OS requires very large patient numbers and also because heterogeneous populations with long post progression survival, crossover and heterogeneous post study therapy as well as the evolving treatment standards for these patients all impact on study outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had considered some of the issues and challenges related to clinical trial design, surrogate outcomes and critical appraisal at its meeting in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in advanced breast cancer there is evidence to support the use of surrogate measure, such as PFS, for OS including a number of systematic reviews across a variety of advanced breast cancer patient populations. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee acknowledged that the quality of these reviews was variable (the number of trials included in these reviews and the number of patients in the trials included differed, some reviews use all lines of therapy whereas some restrict to first or second line) almost all of these reviews addressed the issue of PFS as a surrogate measure for OS in metastatic disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some reviews did not show any correlation between PFS and OS while other showed a modest correlation (square correlation statistic ranged from 0.1-0.57), however considered that the more tightly the population was defined the better the correlation became for example HR-positive, HER2-negative disease in premenopausal women.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.38.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted a<span style=\"color: black;\"> study of mBC patients and oncology care providers (</span>nurses<span style=\"color: black;\"> and oncologists) in the US aimed at evaluating by the value of OS, PFS, and other treatment attributes in treatment decision by surveys designed to assess preferences for OS/PFS and stable disease and the timing thereof, preferences for level of evidence and toxicity rates as well as willingness to pay for specific treatment attributes (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589981/\" target=\"_blank\">MacEwan et al MDM Policy Pract. 2019; 4: 2381468319855386</a><span style=\"color: black;\">).</span></p><p>General comments</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.39.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that on 1 September 2019, PHARMAC issued a <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/rfp-2019-09-01-cdk4-cdk6/\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Proposals</a> for the supply of a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and that this process was seeking commercial bids from the suppliers of these medicines for use as both first and second-line treatment for patients who meet the Special Authority criteria detailed in the RFP document (as recommended by CaTSoP in April 2019).

The Committee considered given the updated published data from the MONALEESA trials, there was likely a health benefit from ribociclib over palbociclib.

The Committee noted that following a median follow up of 53.5 months, the median overall survival in the overall study population was 58.7 months in the ribociclib group vs 48.0 months in the placebo group (absolute difference +10.7 months, HR 0.76 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96), in the aromatase inhibitor subpopulation median overall survival was 58.7 months in the ribociclib group vs 47.7 months in the placebo group (absolute difference +11.0 months, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04); and in the tamoxifen subpopulation overall survival was not reached in the ribociclib group and 49.3 months in the placebo group (absolute difference incalculable, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10).</p><p>1.1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, overall, the three trials demonstrated an overall survival benefit for ribociclib.

The Committee noted that these trials did not report statistically significant improvements in overall survival from palbociclib compared to the control arm. </p><p>1.1.10. The Committee considered given the updated published data from the MONALEESA trials, there was likely a health benefit from ribociclib over palbociclib. The Committee considered the toxicity profiles of the two medicines remained similar. The Committee considered that, in light of the new evidence (updated ribociclib OS survival), and published data for palbociclib, contrary to its earlier advice, there was not a class effect among CDK4/6 inhibitors and that ribociclib and palbociclib would likely not provide the same or similar health benefits for people with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.11.The Committee considered that, clinically, if both were funded, the use of ribociclib would be preferred over palbociclib given the apparent overall survival benefit for ribociclib. The Committee considered that if ribociclib were to be funded, most individuals would be prescribed ribociclib. </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.12.The Committee considered there was insufficient evidence to support the use of a second CDK4/6 inhibitor after progression on another CDK4/6 inhibitor and that any Special Authority criteria should limit use of these agents to once per person lifetime. </p><h4><strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Palbociclib generic alternatives</em></strong></h4><p>1.1.13.The Committee noted that Pharmac sought advice regarding a potential transition to a generic palbociclib. The Committee noted the extensive experience of Pharmac and New Zealand for generic brand changes, for both malignant and non-malignant diseases The Committee considered that there would be no specific concerns with a brand change for palbociclib. </p><p>1.1.14.The Committee noted that a generic palbociclib (Palbociclib Pfizer) had recently gained Medsafe approval and that it is manufactured in the same manufacturing plant, to the same specifications, and is packaged similarly, to the currently funded brand, Ibrance.</p><p>1.1.15.The Committee considered that Palbociclib Pfizer would be a suitable generic substitute for the currently funded brand of palbociclib if a brand change were to occur. The Committee considered that a brand change for palbociclib could be managed through appropriate communications to and educating both individuals with the disease and health care professionals, similarly to other brand changes. The Committee considered that if there were a brand change to Palbociclib Pfizer that added confidence would be provided through messaging that it is manufactured by the same company at the same plant. </p><p>1.1.16.The Committee did not consider there would be a subset of people who would continue to require access to the Ibrance brand of palbociclib via an <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/policies-manuals-and-processes/exceptional-circumstances-framework-including-the-named-patient-pharmaceutical-assessment-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptional Circumstances framework</a>. </p><p>1.1.17.The Committee considered that if ribociclib was also funded, any savings from changing to generic palbociclib would likely be eroded by the increased share of ribociclib prescribed.\u00a0</p>",
