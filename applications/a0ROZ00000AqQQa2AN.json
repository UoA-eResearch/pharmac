The Subcommittee noted that the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> estimates about ten million people are diagnosed with tuberculosis annually and over half of the TB cases occur in South East Asia and the Western Pacific.</p><p><br></p><p>5.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that tuberculosis is a notifiable disease and that notification rates in New Zealand between 2011 and 2015 were between 6.2-7.0 per 100,000 in the population (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/guidelines-tuberculosis-control-new-zealand-2019-august2019-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2019</a>), equivalent to about 314 people per year in New Zealand with tuberculosis. The Subcommittee noted that the vast majority of patients with tuberculosis in New Zealand were born outside of New Zealand (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/guidelines-tuberculosis-control-new-zealand-2019-august2019-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Health, 2019</a>) and that between 2012 and 2016, the percentages of cases were higher for areas with higher deprivation. </p><p><br></p><p>5.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/guidelines-tuberculosis-control-new-zealand-2019-august2019-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Guidelines for Tuberculosis Control in New Zealand (2019. Wellington: Ministry of Health)</a> state that the initial treatment of drug-sensitive tuberculosis in adults and children over 8 years of age usually includes two months of intensive treatment (bactericidal phase), followed by four months of treatment in a continuation or sterilisation phase. The Subcommittee noted that tuberculosis treatment would most often be commenced in a hospital setting rather than in the community.</p><p><br></p><p>5.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that first-line funded treatment of tuberculosis consists of four medicines, either administered as individual tablets or as a two-drug combination tablet plus other individual tablets. The Subcommittee noted the applicant considers that daily dosing with currently funded treatments for tuberculosis would consist of isoniazid/rifampicin (two 150/300 mg tablets combining both medicines), pyrazinamide (four 500 mg tablets) and ethambutol (two 400 mg tablets) which is equivalent to a total daily intake of 600 mg rifampicin, 300 mg isoniazid, 2,000 mg pyrazinamide and 1,000 mg ethambutol (based on a 70 kg patient), achieved with 11 tablets per day. </p><p><br></p><p>5.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that tuberculosis requires a long duration of treatment, that patients with tuberculosis have a high health need, and noted that there is a public health risk for patients with active tuberculosis and that this therefore conveys a health need onto others.</p><p><br></p><p>5.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that current funded therapy requires a high number of tablets daily and considered that this can contribute to poor adherence and confusion, or patients may choose to be selectively non-adherent e.g. by not taking a particular medication. The Subcommittee considered that these challenges can lead to development of resistant tuberculosis, resulting in prolonged treatment of approximately six to nine months with high-cost second-line regimens.</p><p><br></p><p>5.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet contains the four first-line medicines used for the treatment of tuberculosis; rifampicin 150mg + isoniazid 75mg + pyrazinamide 400mg + ethambutol 275mg for use in the bactericidal (intensive) phase of treatment, with dosing according to bodyweight category (i.e. 30-39kg: two tablets daily; 40-54kg: three tablets; 55-70kg: four tablets; &gt;70kg: five tablets). The Subcommittee noted the applicant\u2019s proposed dosing of five tablets daily of rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol 150 mg/75 mg/400 mg/275 mg is equivalent to a total daily intake of 750 mg rifampicin, 375 mg isoniazid, 2,000 mg pyrazinamide and 1,375 mg ethambutol based on a 70 kg patient. </p><p><br></p><p>5.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that no fixed-dose combination rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol tablet has been approved by Medsafe nor has an application for one been submitted to Medsafe.

The Subcommittee noted that the recommended dosages of each of the four first-line agents is presented as both a maximum dose per kilogram, and as a maximum dose per day. Members considered that reduced bioavailability of some medicines (e.g. rifampicin) was not a concern with the fixed-dose combination tablet. </p><p><br></p><p>5.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that weight-based dosing (i.e. mg per kg, presented as a value range) was challenging in tuberculosis treatment and noted that the New Zealand tuberculosis guidelines specify weight-based doses that may be difficult to achieve precisely in some patients with use of fixed-dose combination tablets alone. </p><p><br></p><p>5.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the dosing of the fixed-dose combination according to bodyweight category appeared consistent with the expected bodyweight of patients with tuberculosis in New Zealand. However, the Subcommittee considered that it could under-dose some patients with low weight or whose weight is near the range limits at higher doses compared to currently funded individual drug regimens. Members considered that dosing with four tablets per day may be more suitable for a 70 kg patient than five tablets, although this would result in a lower daily dose of pyrazinamide than the funded individual drug regimen. </p><p><br></p><p>5.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Members noted a systematic review and meta-analysis of fixed dose combination tuberculosis therapy that states that fixed-dose combination formulations simplify tuberculosis treatment and are associated with a trend towards reduction in treatment failure or relapse (<a href=\"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/42/3/721\" target=\"_blank\">Albanna et al. Eur Resp J. 2013;42:721-32</a>). The authors report a statistically insignificant difference in drug resistance and adverse drug reactions and a clinically unimportant difference in culture conversion after two months of treatment. Members noted the authors also state that fixed-dose combinations are not superior to individual tablets and acknowledge that none of the included studies identified improved adherence with the fixed-dose combination compared to separate formulations.</p><p><br></p><p>5.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a Cochrane review of fixed-dose combinations of drugs versus single-drug formulations for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, from 13 randomised controlled trials that reported results between 1987 and 2015 that included 5,824 patients treated for newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis in countries with high tuberculosis prevalence (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27186634/\" target=\"_blank\">Gallardo et al.

There was insufficient robust data to show an improved adherence with the fixed-dose combination, compared with individual tablets, but a decline in adherence would be improbable. </p><p><br></p><p>5.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the main benefit of the fixed-dose combination for tuberculosis appeared to be the reduced pill burden which could increase patient adherence to treatment. The Subcommittee considered that this would likely lead to reduced patient confusion around dosing and reduced selective non-adherence. The Subcommittee considered that the fixed-dose combination could also offered greater convenience and simplicity than the funded individual tablets.</p><p><br></p><p>5.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that informal discussion with treating clinicians in New Zealand had identified strong support for the funded use of this particular fixed-dose combination and that the clinicians considered that it would improve patient care and adherence, and would reduce prescribing risks.</p><p><br></p><p>5.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if the fixed-dose combination were to be funded for the treatment of tuberculosis, it would be important for all individual tablets to remain funded to manage toxicity and rechallenge, to facilitate optimal dosing (noting variation in patient weight including low weights and weights near the range limits at higher doses) and to allow for flexibility in patient management (e.g. for patients receiving treatment with complicated regimens).</p><p><br></p><p>5.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the fixed-dose combination could be cost-effective or potentially cost-saving, depending on price. The Subcommittee considered that no funding criteria would be required to restrict access because the fixed-dose combination would only be used for the treatment of tuberculosis, and because patient and clinician preferences including assessment of dosage calculations and options would determine whether to use fixed-dose combinations or individual medicines.</p><p><br></p><p>5.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that, whilst noting the lack of robust evidence demonstrating improvements in adherence and outcomes with the fixed-dose combination, from their expert perspective (or from a treating clinician perspective) the potential benefits of the fixed-dose combination (i.e. reduced pill burden, potential for improved adherence, improved suitability, and the possibility of cost savings) outweighed the manageable risks associated with potentially underdosing patients if the fixed-dose combination were used alone for all bodyweights, and needing to access individual tablets in cases of toxicity.\u00a0</p>",
