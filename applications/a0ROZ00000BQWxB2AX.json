          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that 3,300 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New Zealand and that approximately 20% of patients will develop metastatic disease at some point. The Subcommittee noted that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced breast cancer have HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to estimate the number of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease who would be eligible for second-line treatment each year in New Zealand, but that it was likely around 200 to 400 patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, while chemotherapy may be used in cases of progressive visceral disease, the standard first-line endocrine therapy for HRpositive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in New Zealand is usually with either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. The Subcommittee considered that these are also the agents most commonly used for second-line treatment, along with some use of megestrol acetate. The Subcommittee considered that chemotherapy is used in cases of progressive visceral disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the choice of endocrine therapy is dependent on menopausal status in addition to other risk factors. The Subcommittee considered that aromatase inhibitors are generally used in women who are postmenopausal, and that tamoxifen is used in both pre- and post-menopausal women. The Subcommittee considered that tamoxifen would be more likely to be used if osteopenia was a concern, and it would be more likely to use an aromatase inhibitor in women with a history or risk of cardiovascular (thromboembolic) complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for patients who have progressed after first-line therapy, as response rates to second-line endocrine therapies are lower (~20%) and often not durable. Members considered the response to chemotherapy is also poor due to the high rate of chemoresistant disease among this subtype.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor which reduces cellular proliferation by blocking cell-cycle progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is approved for use in New Zealand for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that an application for the registration of ribociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated by Medsafe; and a third CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, is also in late-stage clinical development. The Subcommittee noted that in September 2018, CaTSoP considered an application for the use of palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial (first-line) endocrine-based therapy for HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP minutes \u2013 Sep 2018</a>). At this time, the Subcommittee considered that palbociclib should be funded with a medium priority in a first-line setting, concluding that there was reasonable evidence of a modest benefit in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Palbociclib </u></i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 521 women with HRpositive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed during prior endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee considered evidence from PALOMA-3 from five publications:</p><ul><li>PALOMA-3 interim analysis, median follow-up 5.6 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030518\" target=\"_blank\">Turner et al. N Engl J Med. 2015;373:209-19</a>).</li><li>PALOMA-3 final analysis, median follow-up 8.9 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947331\" target=\"_blank\">Cristofanilli et al. Lancet Oncol. 2016;17:425-39</a>).</li><li>PALOMA-3 detailed safety analysis, median follow-up 8.9 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27368881\" target=\"_blank\">Verma et al.

N Engl J Med. 2018;379:1926-36</a>).</li><li>PALOMA-3 patient reported outcomes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880065/\" target=\"_blank\">Harbeck et al. Ann Oncol. 2016;27:1047-54</a>).</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that 52% of individuals in PALOMA-3 had received two or more lines of prior endocrine therapy (Cristofanilli et al. 2016). The Subcommittee considered that the population included in PALOMA-3 therefore represented patients receiving late therapy, not just second-line therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis of PALOMA-3, Cristofanilli et al. 2016 reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 4.6 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.59; P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee considered that the response to treatment was relatively slow to manifest, with a median time to response of 112 days in the palbociclib arm. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that endocrine therapy resistance was assessed by a number of parameters in PALOMA-3, including by tumour PIK3CA mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that at the time of the final analysis (median follow-up 8.9 months) PIK3CA status did not significantly affect treatment response (median PFS PIK3CA positive: 9.5 months palbociclib vs 3.6 months placebo; median PFS PIK3CA negative: 9.9 months palbociclib vs 4.6 months placebo; two-sided Pinteraction=0.83) (Cristofanilli et al.2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of PALOMA-3, Turner et al. 2018 reported a median OS of 34.9 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 28.0 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09). The Subcommittee noted that PALOMA3 was not powered to detect an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the subgroup analysis conducted at the time of the prespecified OS analysis as reported by Turner et al. 2018. The Subcommittee considered that the subgroups who appeared to benefit most from treatment with palbociclib included patients with sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, patients who were postmenopausal at study entry, patients aged 65 years or over, and patients with a disease-free interval of more than 24 months. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that assessing OS is difficult in diseases such as HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in early-line settings, due to the long survival time and because patients often receive multiple lines of subsequent therapy. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-3, 4% of patients 14 in the palbociclib arm and 16% of patients in the placebo arm received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a subsequent line of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that this makes the interpretation of benefit difficult, and that, if anything, may underestimate the magnitude of benefit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was well tolerated in PALOMA-3 (Verma et al. 2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with advanced disease inevitably have a shorter progression-free periods in response to each additional line of treatment; and considered that the PFS benefit observed in later line patients in PALOMA-3 reflected this. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-2, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole as a first-line treatment in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer the median PFS was 24.8 months palbociclib vs 14.5 months placebo (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:1925-1936</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer has received a score of 4 on the European Society for Medical Oncology \u2013 Magnitude of Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS; graded from 1 [worst] to 5 [best]). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for an additional treatment option for women with previously-treated HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and that PALOMA-3 provides good evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting and that further data would likely show an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other CDK4/6 inhibitors </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is a growing body of data regarding the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first- and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Ribociclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the second interim analysis of the phase 3 MONALEESA-2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of firstline ribociclib plus letrozole compared with placebo plus letrozole in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718092\" target=\"_blank\">Hortobagyi et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1541-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the median PFS was 25.3 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 16.0 month in the placebo/letrozole arm (HR 0.568; 95% CI 0.457 to 0.704; log-rank P = 9.63 x 10-8 ). The Subcommittee considered that this result was comparable to that observed in PALOMA-2. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with placebo and endocrine therapy in 672 premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902\" target=\"_blank\">Tripathy et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:904-15</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients could receive either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor as endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 19.2 months, that the median PFS was 23.8 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 13.0 months in the placebo/endocrine therapy arm (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.69; P&lt;0.0001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the initial results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of ribociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 484 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer who were treatment na\u00efve or had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860922\" target=\"_blank\">Slamon et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2465- 72</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 20.4 months, that the median PFS was 20.5 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 12.8 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm (HR 0.593; 95% CI 0.480 to 0.732; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS in patients who were treatment-na\u00efve in this trial was not reached in the ribociclib arm compared with 18.3 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Abemaciclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a planned interim analysis of the phase 3 MONARCH-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared with placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28968163\" target=\"_blank\">Goetz et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:3638-3646</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow up of 17.8 months, the median PFS was not reached in the abemaciclib arm compared with 14.7 months in the placebo/aromatase inhibitor arm (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.72; P=0.000021). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONARCH 2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone in 669 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed while receiving endocrine therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580882\" target=\"_blank\">Sledge et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:2875-2884</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS was 16.4 months in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm compared with 9.3 months in the fulvestrant monotherapy arm (HR 0.553; 95% CI 0.449 to 0.681; P&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the single-arm, phase 2 MONARCH-1 trial, which investigated the activity and safety of abemaciclib monotherapy in 132 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had one or two chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533223\" target=\"_blank\">Dickler et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2017;23:5218- 5224</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at the 12-month final analysis, the objective response rate was 19.7% (95% CI 13.3 to 27.5), the clinical benefit rate was 42.4%, the median PFS was 6.0 months, and the median OS was 17.7 months. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General Comments </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, although there are no head to head trials, the body of data available to date regarding the efficacy and safety of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first-line and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer suggests that there is likely to be a class effect with these agents, and that they can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic benefit in these settings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that additional data would be helpful to further clarify the role of the endocrine partner in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. However, from currently available data the choice of endocrine partner appears not to have a significant impact on the efficacy of combination treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors; and that tamoxifen, non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant could potentially be used interchangeably in this setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is currently no evidence available regarding whether it is better to use a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the first- or second-line for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advance breast cancer. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for use in the first-line is more mature at this time, but that the health need for patients who have received prior endocrine therapy for advance disease is higher than for treatment-na\u00efve patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the group of patients who responded well to first-line endocrine therapy (hormone sensitive patients) were the group most likely to respond well to second-line CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy.\u00a0</p>",
          "fs": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that 3,300 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New Zealand and that approximately 20% of patients will develop metastatic disease at some point. The Subcommittee noted that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced breast cancer have HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to estimate the number of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease who would be eligible for second-line treatment each year in New Zealand, but that it was likely around 200 to 400 patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, while chemotherapy may be used in cases of progressive visceral disease, the standard first-line endocrine therapy for HRpositive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in New Zealand is usually with either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. The Subcommittee considered that these are also the agents most commonly used for second-line treatment, along with some use of megestrol acetate. The Subcommittee considered that chemotherapy is used in cases of progressive visceral disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the choice of endocrine therapy is dependent on menopausal status in addition to other risk factors. The Subcommittee considered that aromatase inhibitors are generally used in women who are postmenopausal, and that tamoxifen is used in both pre- and post-menopausal women. The Subcommittee considered that tamoxifen would be more likely to be used if osteopenia was a concern, and it would be more likely to use an aromatase inhibitor in women with a history or risk of cardiovascular (thromboembolic) complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for patients who have progressed after first-line therapy, as response rates to second-line endocrine therapies are lower (~20%) and often not durable. Members considered the response to chemotherapy is also poor due to the high rate of chemoresistant disease among this subtype.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor which reduces cellular proliferation by blocking cell-cycle progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is approved for use in New Zealand for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that an application for the registration of ribociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated by Medsafe; and a third CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, is also in late-stage clinical development. The Subcommittee noted that in September 2018, CaTSoP considered an application for the use of palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial (first-line) endocrine-based therapy for HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP minutes \u2013 Sep 2018</a>). At this time, the Subcommittee considered that palbociclib should be funded with a medium priority in a first-line setting, concluding that there was reasonable evidence of a modest benefit in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Palbociclib </u></i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 521 women with HRpositive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed during prior endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee considered evidence from PALOMA-3 from five publications:</p><ul><li>PALOMA-3 interim analysis, median follow-up 5.6 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030518\" target=\"_blank\">Turner et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the population included in PALOMA-3 therefore represented patients receiving late therapy, not just second-line therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis of PALOMA-3, Cristofanilli et al. 2016 reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 4.6 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.59; P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee considered that the response to treatment was relatively slow to manifest, with a median time to response of 112 days in the palbociclib arm. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that endocrine therapy resistance was assessed by a number of parameters in PALOMA-3, including by tumour PIK3CA mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that at the time of the final analysis (median follow-up 8.9 months) PIK3CA status did not significantly affect treatment response (median PFS PIK3CA positive: 9.5 months palbociclib vs 3.6 months placebo; median PFS PIK3CA negative: 9.9 months palbociclib vs 4.6 months placebo; two-sided Pinteraction=0.83) (Cristofanilli et al.2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of PALOMA-3, Turner et al. 2018 reported a median OS of 34.9 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 28.0 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09). The Subcommittee noted that PALOMA3 was not powered to detect an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the subgroup analysis conducted at the time of the prespecified OS analysis as reported by Turner et al. 2018. The Subcommittee considered that the subgroups who appeared to benefit most from treatment with palbociclib included patients with sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, patients who were postmenopausal at study entry, patients aged 65 years or over, and patients with a disease-free interval of more than 24 months. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that assessing OS is difficult in diseases such as HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in early-line settings, due to the long survival time and because patients often receive multiple lines of subsequent therapy. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-3, 4% of patients 14 in the palbociclib arm and 16% of patients in the placebo arm received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a subsequent line of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that this makes the interpretation of benefit difficult, and that, if anything, may underestimate the magnitude of benefit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was well tolerated in PALOMA-3 (Verma et al. 2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with advanced disease inevitably have a shorter progression-free periods in response to each additional line of treatment; and considered that the PFS benefit observed in later line patients in PALOMA-3 reflected this. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-2, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole as a first-line treatment in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer the median PFS was 24.8 months palbociclib vs 14.5 months placebo (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:1925-1936</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer has received a score of 4 on the European Society for Medical Oncology \u2013 Magnitude of Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS; graded from 1 [worst] to 5 [best]). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for an additional treatment option for women with previously-treated HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and that PALOMA-3 provides good evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting and that further data would likely show an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other CDK4/6 inhibitors </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is a growing body of data regarding the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first- and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Ribociclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the second interim analysis of the phase 3 MONALEESA-2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of firstline ribociclib plus letrozole compared with placebo plus letrozole in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718092\" target=\"_blank\">Hortobagyi et al.

          "Published_Application__c": "<p>The Subcommittee reviewed a funding application from the Breast Cancer Aotearoa Coalition (BCAC) for palbociclib to be used in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also reviewed information regarding other CDK4/6 inhibitors and considered whether there was a class effect with these agents for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee took into account, where applicable, PHARMAC\u2019s relevant decision-making framework when considering the agenda item.\u00a0</p>",
          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that 3,300 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New Zealand and that approximately 20% of patients will develop metastatic disease at some point. The Subcommittee noted that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced breast cancer have HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to estimate the number of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease who would be eligible for second-line treatment each year in New Zealand, but that it was likely around 200 to 400 patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, while chemotherapy may be used in cases of progressive visceral disease, the standard first-line endocrine therapy for HRpositive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in New Zealand is usually with either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. The Subcommittee considered that these are also the agents most commonly used for second-line treatment, along with some use of megestrol acetate. The Subcommittee considered that chemotherapy is used in cases of progressive visceral disease.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the choice of endocrine therapy is dependent on menopausal status in addition to other risk factors. The Subcommittee considered that aromatase inhibitors are generally used in women who are postmenopausal, and that tamoxifen is used in both pre- and post-menopausal women. The Subcommittee considered that tamoxifen would be more likely to be used if osteopenia was a concern, and it would be more likely to use an aromatase inhibitor in women with a history or risk of cardiovascular (thromboembolic) complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for patients who have progressed after first-line therapy, as response rates to second-line endocrine therapies are lower (~20%) and often not durable. Members considered the response to chemotherapy is also poor due to the high rate of chemoresistant disease among this subtype.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor which reduces cellular proliferation by blocking cell-cycle progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib is approved for use in New Zealand for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that an application for the registration of ribociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated by Medsafe; and a third CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, is also in late-stage clinical development. The Subcommittee noted that in September 2018, CaTSoP considered an application for the use of palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial (first-line) endocrine-based therapy for HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP minutes \u2013 Sep 2018</a>). At this time, the Subcommittee considered that palbociclib should be funded with a medium priority in a first-line setting, concluding that there was reasonable evidence of a modest benefit in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Palbociclib </u></i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 521 women with HRpositive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed during prior endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee considered evidence from PALOMA-3 from five publications:</p><ul><li>PALOMA-3 interim analysis, median follow-up 5.6 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030518\" target=\"_blank\">Turner et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the population included in PALOMA-3 therefore represented patients receiving late therapy, not just second-line therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis of PALOMA-3, Cristofanilli et al. 2016 reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 4.6 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.59; P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee considered that the response to treatment was relatively slow to manifest, with a median time to response of 112 days in the palbociclib arm. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that endocrine therapy resistance was assessed by a number of parameters in PALOMA-3, including by tumour PIK3CA mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that at the time of the final analysis (median follow-up 8.9 months) PIK3CA status did not significantly affect treatment response (median PFS PIK3CA positive: 9.5 months palbociclib vs 3.6 months placebo; median PFS PIK3CA negative: 9.9 months palbociclib vs 4.6 months placebo; two-sided Pinteraction=0.83) (Cristofanilli et al.2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of PALOMA-3, Turner et al. 2018 reported a median OS of 34.9 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 28.0 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09). The Subcommittee noted that PALOMA3 was not powered to detect an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the subgroup analysis conducted at the time of the prespecified OS analysis as reported by Turner et al. 2018. The Subcommittee considered that the subgroups who appeared to benefit most from treatment with palbociclib included patients with sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, patients who were postmenopausal at study entry, patients aged 65 years or over, and patients with a disease-free interval of more than 24 months. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that assessing OS is difficult in diseases such as HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in early-line settings, due to the long survival time and because patients often receive multiple lines of subsequent therapy. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-3, 4% of patients 14 in the palbociclib arm and 16% of patients in the placebo arm received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a subsequent line of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that this makes the interpretation of benefit difficult, and that, if anything, may underestimate the magnitude of benefit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was well tolerated in PALOMA-3 (Verma et al. 2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with advanced disease inevitably have a shorter progression-free periods in response to each additional line of treatment; and considered that the PFS benefit observed in later line patients in PALOMA-3 reflected this. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-2, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole as a first-line treatment in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer the median PFS was 24.8 months palbociclib vs 14.5 months placebo (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:1925-1936</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer has received a score of 4 on the European Society for Medical Oncology \u2013 Magnitude of Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS; graded from 1 [worst] to 5 [best]). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for an additional treatment option for women with previously-treated HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and that PALOMA-3 provides good evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting and that further data would likely show an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other CDK4/6 inhibitors </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is a growing body of data regarding the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first- and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Ribociclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the second interim analysis of the phase 3 MONALEESA-2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of firstline ribociclib plus letrozole compared with placebo plus letrozole in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718092\" target=\"_blank\">Hortobagyi et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1541-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the median PFS was 25.3 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 16.0 month in the placebo/letrozole arm (HR 0.568; 95% CI 0.457 to 0.704; log-rank P = 9.63 x 10-8 ). The Subcommittee considered that this result was comparable to that observed in PALOMA-2. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with placebo and endocrine therapy in 672 premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902\" target=\"_blank\">Tripathy et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:904-15</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients could receive either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor as endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 19.2 months, that the median PFS was 23.8 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 13.0 months in the placebo/endocrine therapy arm (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.69; P&lt;0.0001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the initial results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of ribociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 484 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer who were treatment na\u00efve or had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860922\" target=\"_blank\">Slamon et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2465- 72</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 20.4 months, that the median PFS was 20.5 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 12.8 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm (HR 0.593; 95% CI 0.480 to 0.732; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS in patients who were treatment-na\u00efve in this trial was not reached in the ribociclib arm compared with 18.3 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Abemaciclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a planned interim analysis of the phase 3 MONARCH-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared with placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28968163\" target=\"_blank\">Goetz et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:3638-3646</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow up of 17.8 months, the median PFS was not reached in the abemaciclib arm compared with 14.7 months in the placebo/aromatase inhibitor arm (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.72; P=0.000021). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONARCH 2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone in 669 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed while receiving endocrine therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580882\" target=\"_blank\">Sledge et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:2875-2884</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS was 16.4 months in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm compared with 9.3 months in the fulvestrant monotherapy arm (HR 0.553; 95% CI 0.449 to 0.681; P&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the single-arm, phase 2 MONARCH-1 trial, which investigated the activity and safety of abemaciclib monotherapy in 132 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had one or two chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533223\" target=\"_blank\">Dickler et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2017;23:5218- 5224</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at the 12-month final analysis, the objective response rate was 19.7% (95% CI 13.3 to 27.5), the clinical benefit rate was 42.4%, the median PFS was 6.0 months, and the median OS was 17.7 months. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General Comments </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, although there are no head to head trials, the body of data available to date regarding the efficacy and safety of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first-line and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer suggests that there is likely to be a class effect with these agents, and that they can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic benefit in these settings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that additional data would be helpful to further clarify the role of the endocrine partner in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. However, from currently available data the choice of endocrine partner appears not to have a significant impact on the efficacy of combination treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors; and that tamoxifen, non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant could potentially be used interchangeably in this setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is currently no evidence available regarding whether it is better to use a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the first- or second-line for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advance breast cancer. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for use in the first-line is more mature at this time, but that the health need for patients who have received prior endocrine therapy for advance disease is higher than for treatment-na\u00efve patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the group of patients who responded well to first-line endocrine therapy (hormone sensitive patients) were the group most likely to respond well to second-line CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy.\u00a0</p>",

The Committee considered that these meta-analyses, in addition to\u00a0the Committee\u2019s review of the primary clinical trials of palbociclib and ribociclib, indicate\u00a0that there is a class effect with the CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that the agents within this\u00a0class can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic effect.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in April 2019, CaTSoP reviewed the evidence available to\u00a0date for the use of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib for the treatment of aBC\u00a0(publication of minutes pending). The Committee noted that based on this CaTSoP\u00a0considered there is a class effect with CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that there is likely to be no\u00a0significant difference in which endocrine partner the CDK4/6 inhibitors are combined\u00a0with.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available at this time regarding switching\u00a0between CDK4/6 inhibitors or continuing the same CDK4/6 inhibitor but switching the\u00a0endocrine partner at progression. The Committee noted that the PACE trial\u00a0(NCT03147287) and the TRINITI trial (NCT02732119) which are investigating the use\u00a0of CDK4/6 inhibitors following prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment are currently underway.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are a large number of trials underway investigating\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, including in different breast cancer subtypes, as\u00a0different treatment combinations, and for the treatment of different stages of breast\u00a0cancer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Committee noted that there are a number of pharmacoeconomic analyses published\u00a0regarding the cost effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603995\" target=\"_blank\">Gogate et al.

The Committee\u00a0noted that these studies generally concluded that CDK4/6 inhibitors exceed willingness\u00a0to pay thresholds at the prices currently being offered. The Committee noted that the\u00a0pharmacoeconomic analyses that compared the cost effectiveness of ribociclib to\u00a0palbociclib found that ribociclib was a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib, noting that\u00a0these analyses are largely driven by the price offered in the country they were conducted\u00a0in (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799329\" target=\"_blank\">Mistry et al.

Ann Oncol. 2018;29:888-94</a>). The Committee noted that if a CDK4/6 inhibitor\u00a0were funded, there may be an increased requirement for the investigation and treatment\u00a0of neutropenia and so additional associated costs to the sector from this.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are limited OS data currently available for the use of\u00a0first line CDK4/6 inhibitors, and the OS data available to date for second line use of\u00a0CDK4/6 inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant difference compared with\u00a0placebo. The Committee noted CaTSoP\u2019s April 2019 discussion of the difficulties in\u00a0assessing OS in disease such as HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer where\u00a0patients have long survival times and receive multiple lines of treatment (CaTSoP April\u00a02019 - publication of minutes pending).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee noted that palbociclib plus fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of\u00a0HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC has a score of 4 on the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical\u00a0Benefit Scale; palbociclib or ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the first-line\u00a0treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC have scores of 3 on the ESMO-Magnitude\u00a0of Clinical Benefit Scale.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0The Committee considered that there is moderate quality evidence that palbociclib or\u00a0ribociclib used in combination with an endocrine partner as a first-line treatment provides\u00a0a modest improvement in PFS and maintains QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC. The Committee considered that while there are good quality Phase 3\u00a0randomized controlled trials available, that the interpretation of results is limited by the\u00a0</p><p>emphasis placed on PFS. The Committee considered that a composite analysis of PFS,\u00a0OS, safety, and QoL data would strengthen the evidence base.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is good quality evidence that palbociclib in\u00a0combination with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment provides a modest improvement\u00a0in PFS with maintenance of QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was uncertain whether the use of a CDK4/6 in a first or second-line setting would provide greater overall benefit for patients, as there was a\u00a0lack of evidence to inform whether these agents altered tumour biology and/or the\u00a0efficacy of subsequent treatments. The Committee considered it was likely that the use\u00a0of a CDK4/6 inhibitor would alter prescriber behaviour for later line treatments.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that patients who have already progressed following one line\u00a0of endocrine therapy have a higher health need than those who are treatment na\u00efve due\u00a0to a lack of alternative treatment options.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Special Authority criteria previously recommended\u00a0by CaTSoP for the first- and second-line use of CDK4/6 inhibitors are appropriate.\u00a0</p>",

The Subcommittee considered this is both because powering studies to show OS requires very large patient numbers and also because heterogeneous populations with long post progression survival, crossover and heterogeneous post study therapy as well as the evolving treatment standards for these patients all impact on study outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had considered some of the issues and challenges related to clinical trial design, surrogate outcomes and critical appraisal at its meeting in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in advanced breast cancer there is evidence to support the use of surrogate measure, such as PFS, for OS including a number of systematic reviews across a variety of advanced breast cancer patient populations.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee acknowledged that the quality of these reviews was variable (the number of trials included in these reviews and the number of patients in the trials included differed, some reviews use all lines of therapy whereas some restrict to first or second line) almost all of these reviews addressed the issue of PFS as a surrogate measure for OS in metastatic disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some reviews did not show any correlation between PFS and OS while other showed a modest correlation (square correlation statistic ranged from 0.1-0.57), however considered that the more tightly the population was defined the better the correlation became for example HR-positive, HER2-negative disease in premenopausal women.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted a<span style=\"color: black;\"> study of mBC patients and oncology care providers (</span>nurses<span style=\"color: black;\"> and oncologists) in the US aimed at evaluating by the value of OS, PFS, and other treatment attributes in treatment decision by surveys designed to assess preferences for OS/PFS and stable disease and the timing thereof, preferences for level of evidence and toxicity rates as well as willingness to pay for specific treatment attributes (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589981/\" target=\"_blank\">MacEwan et al MDM Policy Pract. 2019; 4: 2381468319855386</a><span style=\"color: black;\">).</span></p><p>General comments</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that on 1 September 2019, PHARMAC issued a <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/rfp-2019-09-01-cdk4-cdk6/\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Proposals</a> for the supply of a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and that this process was seeking commercial bids from the suppliers of these medicines for use as both first and second-line treatment for patients who meet the Special Authority criteria detailed in the RFP document (as recommended by CaTSoP in April 2019).

The Subcommittee noted that PTAC considered it would be useful that CaTSoP clarify its advice about CDK4/6 inhibitors so that PTAC could further consider its priorities and recommendations for this class of agents.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in particular PTAC asked if CaTSoP could provide a more detailed evidence review and discussion about:</p><p>o<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>Why the health need of a second-line population was rated higher than the first-line setting, but that the recorded recommendation was that funding of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a class was a lower priority for use in second-line than in first-line.</p><p>o<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>More details about CaTSoP\u2019s interpretation of the evidence for differences in outcomes such as for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and quality of life in both first- or second-line settings for late breast cancers.</p><p>o<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>More details about CaTSoP\u2019s assessment the OS benefit, its magnitude, and precision, for the different treatment settings, and the evidence used for this advice.</p><p>o<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>in the context of CDK4/6 inhibitors, advice on: the strength and quality of available evidence for the use of surrogate outcomes specifically for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers, particularly those that are HR-positive and/or HER2-negative, and thus the applicability of such outcomes data in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that previously treated (second-line) patients were considered to have a higher health need than those in the first-line population as they would be more symptomatic and have likely to exhaust their endocrine options more quickly. However, the Subcommittee considered that in April 2019 the relative funding priority for all second-line patients was considered to be slightly lower than that in the first-line setting due to the quality of evidence and likely higher absolute level of benefit in terms of PFS and OS in a first-line setting. Although, members noted that this does not include those second-line patients with hormone sensitive disease where the data in this subgroup is considered to be stronger than in a general second-line population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated survival data for ribociclib from MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 reinforced the signal of a class effect from use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that benefit from use of CDK4/6 inhibitor has been demonstrated across both first and second-line populations. The Subcommittee considered that the differences in trial results is likely to have been driven by heterogeneity of the trial populations, such as the number of patients with endocrine-sensitive disease or ESR-1 mutation rates, although this was based on expert opinion and not supported by any current data.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a benefit from CDK4/6 inhibitors is reported in both first-line post-menopausal patients and first-line pre-menopausal patients treated with ovarian suppression with the strength of evidence best for those who receive aromatase inhibitor and goserelin. The Subcommittee considered that patients with hormone-sensitive disease appear to get the most benefit from use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a second-line setting; and that the durability of response for the overall second-line population is likely to be slightly shorter than when used in a first-line HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the various trials for use of the three CDK4/6 inhibitor agents with currently published evidence, the ribociclib trials were of highest quality due to their clinical trial design, which meant that OS could be demonstrated, whereas the survival data from the palbociclib and abemaciclib trials were compromised by the crossover design.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is good quality evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a PFS of around 10 to 12 months and around a 30% improvement in OS (in a disease setting where it is difficult to demonstrate OS gain) both of which were clinically meaningful for patients with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while improving OS is considered the most important therapeutic goal in advanced breast cancer, it has been difficult to demonstrate an OS advantage in clinical trials in advanced breast cancer populations and particularly in a first-line setting. The Subcommittee considered this is both because powering studies to show OS requires very large patient numbers and also because heterogeneous populations with long post progression survival, crossover and heterogeneous post study therapy as well as the evolving treatment standards for these patients all impact on study outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that it had considered some of the issues and challenges related to clinical trial design, surrogate outcomes and critical appraisal at its meeting in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">July 2019</a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in advanced breast cancer there is evidence to support the use of surrogate measure, such as PFS, for OS including a number of systematic reviews across a variety of advanced breast cancer patient populations.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee acknowledged that the quality of these reviews was variable (the number of trials included in these reviews and the number of patients in the trials included differed, some reviews use all lines of therapy whereas some restrict to first or second line) almost all of these reviews addressed the issue of PFS as a surrogate measure for OS in metastatic disease.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some reviews did not show any correlation between PFS and OS while other showed a modest correlation (square correlation statistic ranged from 0.1-0.57), however considered that the more tightly the population was defined the better the correlation became for example HR-positive, HER2-negative disease in premenopausal women.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee also noted a<span style=\"color: black;\"> study of mBC patients and oncology care providers (</span>nurses<span style=\"color: black;\"> and oncologists) in the US aimed at evaluating by the value of OS, PFS, and other treatment attributes in treatment decision by surveys designed to assess preferences for OS/PFS and stable disease and the timing thereof, preferences for level of evidence and toxicity rates as well as willingness to pay for specific treatment attributes (</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589981/\" target=\"_blank\">MacEwan et al MDM Policy Pract. 2019; 4: 2381468319855386</a><span style=\"color: black;\">).</span></p><p>General comments</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that on 1 September 2019, PHARMAC issued a <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news/rfp-2019-09-01-cdk4-cdk6/\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Proposals</a> for the supply of a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and that this process was seeking commercial bids from the suppliers of these medicines for use as both first and second-line treatment for patients who meet the Special Authority criteria detailed in the RFP document (as recommended by CaTSoP in April 2019). The Subcommittee considered it would be a preferred outcome for both first and second-line populations to be funded as a result of this competitive process.</p>",
