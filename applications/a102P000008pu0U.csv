It was also noted that bleach products can include other ingredients (eg gels and surfactants) which may be irritating to the skin or have unknown impacts on sodium hypochlorite release. Members noted that not all households have a bath available, although large buckets placed in the shower are sometimes used for children in homes where baths are not available. It was also noted that the cost of hot water limited access to treatment, and that due to this in some cases multiple children will bathe in the sodium hypochlorite bath, rather than just the individual, which may confer protection from bacterial-related skin infection to other children in the whānau. The Committee noted that sodium hypochlorite can degrade over a relatively short period of time, and considered this could be better managed with a funded product with standardised expiration and a lower volume. The Committee considered that standardised concentrations and dosing should be considered for a funded product, as fixed volumes and concentrated solutions would allow for standardised instructions, although it was unclear whether a range of strengths or concentrations would need to be funded. The Committee acknowledged that clear instructions on usage and the availability of a bathtub would also be required, although members considered it may be feasible to apply using a sponge followed by rinsing off in a shower. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite would convey benefits from engagement with a primary healthcare provider through education on optimal management and safety, including instructions for sodium hypochlorite use and dose standardisation.

The Committee considered that Pharmac could include other decolonisation such as oral or topical antibiotics as a comparator for its assessment, although it was noted that there has been a shift away from the use of oral antibiotics for decolonisation in recent years. The Committee considered that use of sodium hypochlorite baths in patients with a history of recurrent infections was not relevant given the focus was on decolonisation.

The Committee noted that bleach products available at supermarkets come in various concentrations. The sizes of baths are variable making it difficult to dilute bleach correctly. It was also noted that bleach products can include other ingredients (eg gels and surfactants) which may be irritating to the skin or have unknown impacts on sodium hypochlorite release. Members noted that not all households have a bath available, although large buckets placed in the shower are sometimes used for children in homes where baths are not available. It was also noted that the cost of hot water limited access to treatment, and that due to this in some cases multiple children will bathe in the sodium hypochlorite bath, rather than just the individual, which may confer protection from bacterial-related skin infection to other children in the whānau. The Committee noted that sodium hypochlorite can degrade over a relatively short period of time, and considered this could be better managed with a funded product with standardised expiration and a lower volume. The Committee considered that standardised concentrations and dosing should be considered for a funded product, as fixed volumes and concentrated solutions would allow for standardised instructions, although it was unclear whether a range of strengths or concentrations would need to be funded. The Committee acknowledged that clear instructions on usage and the availability of a bathtub would also be required, although members considered it may be feasible to apply using a sponge followed by rinsing off in a shower. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite would convey benefits from engagement with a primary healthcare provider through education on optimal management and safety, including instructions for sodium hypochlorite use and dose standardisation. The Committee noted that the co-payment for sodium hypochlorite would not be applicable for young children and that children are eligible for free GP visits, but acknowledged that there may be other barriers to visiting a GP, including unavailability of appointment, patient time, and rural location. The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite for community use might improve equity but acknowledged that this may be limited given there is no prescription co-payment on medicines or fees for general practice care for children aged 13 and under.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite was unlikely to create any significant changes in health sector expenditure, although it was unclear who would prepare the product in a standardised concentration. The Committee considered it was unclear what impact funding sodium hypochlorite via the community Schedule would have on its usage in hospitals, and considered that Pharmac could seek a view on this from the Dermatology Advisory Committee if this was pertinent. It was noted that some hospitals also use potassium permanganate. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that sodium hypochlorite would be used for as long as required until another intervention is needed, and considered that adults were more likely to use other options such as oral or topical antibiotics. The Committee considered that sodium hypochlorite would replace oral or topical antibiotics, and might replace or be used in combination with a funded topical corticosteroid. The Committee considered that Pharmac could include other decolonisation such as oral or topical antibiotics as a comparator for its assessment, although it was noted that there has been a shift away from the use of oral antibiotics for decolonisation in recent years. The Committee considered that use of sodium hypochlorite baths in patients with a history of recurrent infections was not relevant given the focus was on decolonisation. The Committee considered that a reduction in antibiotic resistance would also be a relevant and important outcome for New Zealand, although this would be hard to quantify for assessment.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for sodium hypochlorite if it were to be funded in New Zealand for atopic dermatitis.

The Committee noted that bleach products available at supermarkets come in various concentrations. The sizes of baths are variable making it difficult to dilute bleach correctly. It was also noted that bleach products can include other ingredients (eg gels and surfactants) which may be irritating to the skin or have unknown impacts on sodium hypochlorite release. Members noted that not all households have a bath available, although large buckets placed in the shower are sometimes used for children in homes where baths are not available. It was also noted that the cost of hot water limited access to treatment, and that due to this in some cases multiple children will bathe in the sodium hypochlorite bath, rather than just the individual, which may confer protection from bacterial-related skin infection to other children in the whānau. The Committee noted that sodium hypochlorite can degrade over a relatively short period of time, and considered this could be better managed with a funded product with standardised expiration and a lower volume. The Committee considered that standardised concentrations and dosing should be considered for a funded product, as fixed volumes and concentrated solutions would allow for standardised instructions, although it was unclear whether a range of strengths or concentrations would need to be funded. The Committee acknowledged that clear instructions on usage and the availability of a bathtub would also be required, although members considered it may be feasible to apply using a sponge followed by rinsing off in a shower. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite would convey benefits from engagement with a primary healthcare provider through education on optimal management and safety, including instructions for sodium hypochlorite use and dose standardisation. The Committee noted that the co-payment for sodium hypochlorite would not be applicable for young children and that children are eligible for free GP visits, but acknowledged that there may be other barriers to visiting a GP, including unavailability of appointment, patient time, and rural location. The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite for community use might improve equity but acknowledged that this may be limited given there is no prescription co-payment on medicines or fees for general practice care for children aged 13 and under.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11pt; color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The Committee considered that funding sodium hypochlorite was unlikely to create any significant changes in health sector expenditure, although it was unclear who would prepare the product in a standardised concentration.

The Committee considered that Pharmac could include other decolonisation such as oral or topical antibiotics as a comparator for its assessment, although it was noted that there has been a shift away from the use of oral antibiotics for decolonisation in recent years. The Committee considered that use of sodium hypochlorite baths in patients with a history of recurrent infections was not relevant given the focus was on decolonisation.
