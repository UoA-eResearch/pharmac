The Committee considered that diagnosis of IgG4 related disease was difficult however there was an increasing awareness and the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism have developed a complex classification process which includes a complete list of exclusions and inclusions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that IgG4-affected organs share several core pathologic features and clinical and serologic similarities, including tumour-like swelling, presence of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and a variable degree of fibrosis that has a characteristic &quot;storiform&quot; pattern. The Committee noted that serum IgG4 concentrations can be elevated (defined as &gt;135 mg/dL, &gt;121 mg/dL, or &gt;86 mg/dL depending upon the laboratory) in approximately two-thirds of patients. The Committee considered that the diagnosis usually depends on radiological features noting that serum IgG4 levels cannot be relied on for diagnosis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that IgG4-related disease has historically had low reported incidence, likely related to difficulty in making this diagnosis, however, patient numbers have increased over time with increasing awareness of IgG4-disease, including incorporating reclassification of other diseases. The Committee considered that most epidemiological information regarding IgG4-related disease comes from studies conducted in Japan and China, where incidence is reported to be between 0.3 and 1.0 per 100,000 per year. The Committee considered that, based on this incidence, it is likely that there would be between 15 and 50 new cases per year in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the incidence is likely to be at the lower end of this range but may rise over time as IgG4-related disease becomes more commonly recognized.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that current treatment for IgG4-related disease typically starts with corticosteroids as first-line treatment with disease usually responding rapidly to treatment unless there is significant fibrosis, noting that fibrosis increases in severity if the diagnosis is delayed. The Committee noted loss of disease response is common once corticosteroids are tapered to low doses, and long-term corticosteroid treatment can lead to substantial toxicity, in particular in patients presenting with autoimmune pancreatitis who are at high risk of diabetes. The Committee noted severe disease may require urgent, high dose corticosteroids.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that treatment with conventional immunomodulators (cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate) is considered for patients who cannot tolerate or have not responded to high dose corticosteroids however these have only a modest effect and are associated with significant adverse effects. Committee considered that the health need for patients with IgG4-related disease is high for those with severe illness experiencing frequent relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a non-randomised trial of low-dose (50 to 100 mg per day) cyclophosphamide in combination with corticosteroid in 102 patients with IgG4-related disease, compared with corticosteroid monotherapy (Yunyun et al. Sci Rep. 2017;7:6195). The Committee noted that at one-year follow-up 38.5% of patients receiving corticosteroid monotherapy had relapsed, compared to a 12% in those who also received combination cyclophosphamide. The Committee noted that the corticosteroid regimen resulted in a new diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus in approximately 10% of participants, however low-dose cyclophosphamide was reported to be relatively well tolerated without any events of bone marrow suppression. The Committee noted that there was no attempt to lower corticosteroid doses below 10 mg/day over the course of the trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a randomised non-blinded trial investigating the use of corticosteroid monotherapy compared with combination therapy of corticosteroid with mycophenolate (1000 to 1500 mg/day) in 69 patients with IgG4-related disease (Yunyun et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2019;58:52-60). The Committee noted that patients were more likely to experience remission on combination therapy (76% on combination therapy vs 40% on corticosteroids alone). The Committee noted that this study also made no attempt to lower corticosteroid doses.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a retrospective multicentre study investigating the long-term efficacy and safety of rituximab in IgG4-related disease using data from a French nationwide study of 33 patients treated either with 2 doses of 1000 mg rituximab separated by 15 days (25 patients), 4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 (six patients), and other regimens in 2 patients (4 weekly doses of 150 mg/m2 or 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 separated by 15 days) (Ebbo et al. PLoS One. 2017;12:e0183844). The Committee noted that despite variability in treatment regimen, the durability of clinical remission persisted for at least six months for most patients, and in some cases extended beyond 18 months. The Committee noted that a clinical response was observed in 29 of the 31 patients in the study, and that patients received maintenance treatment, at treating clinician&#39;s discretion, between one to 17 months after initial treatment with rituximab. The Committee noted that the probability of relapse-free survival was higher with rituximab maintenance than without (p=0.016). The Committee noted that there were nine severe infections during the course of the study and no deaths.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a prospective, open-label trial of patients with active disease defined by the IgG4-RD Responder Index treated with two doses of rituximab (1000 mg each dose) (Carruthers et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2015;74:1171-7). The Committee noted that of the 30 patients included in the study, 27 patients had discontinued corticosteroid use at 12 months, and 60% of patients achieved complete remission. The Committee noted that 19 patients had elevated baseline serum IgG4 concentrations with a mean concentration of 911 mg/dL (range 138–4780 mg/dL), which declined to 422 mg/dL (range 56–2410 mg/dL) at month 6 following rituximab treatment (p&lt;0.05). The Committee noted that 42% of patients in the study achieved normal IgG4 serum levels and considered that these results were unlikely to be achievable with immunomodulator treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a study on the long-term efficacy of maintenance therapy with rituximab for IgG4-related disease in 14 patients either treated on relapse or every 6 months as maintenance (either 1000 or 2000 mg) (Campochiaro et al. Eur J Intern Med. 2020;74:92- 8). The Committee noted that 100% of patients undergoing maintenance treatment were relapse-free at 18 months, compared with 29% in the group only treated at relapse (p=0.006).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that one of the most common presentations of IgG4-related disease is autoimmune pancreatitis and noted a Mayo clinic study describing the experience of treating relapsing autoimmune pancreatitis with immunomodulators and rituximab (Hart et al. Gut. 2013;62:1607-15). The Committee noted that during a median follow-up of 47 months, 52 of 116 autoimmune pancreatitis patients, who were all treated with corticosteroids and immunomodulators, experienced 76 relapse episodes. The Committee noted that first relapses were treated with a course of corticosteroids in 24 patients, and with corticosteroids plus immunomodulators in another 27 patients and noted that the subsequent relapse-free survival was similar between the two groups (p=0.23). The Committee noted that 38 patients received an immunomodulator for more than 2 months, and that failure or intolerance of immunomodulator therapy occurred in 45% of patients. The Committee noted that 12 patients with corticosteroid or immunomodulator intolerance/resistance were subsequently treated with rituximab, with 83% of those patients experiencing complete remission without relapse while on maintenance therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a study investigating the clinical phenotypes of IgG4-related disease and how these affect different prognostic outcomes (Lanzillotta et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59:2435-42). The Committee noted that patients with biliary involvement had higher relapse rates than other groups and were more likely to develop diabetes mellitus (in 62%, compared with 7% of patients with retroperitoneum/aortitis disease, 21% of patients with head and neck limited IgG4-related disease, and 31% with Mikulicz/systemic disease).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted another Mayo clinic study investigating the effects of rituximab with or without maintenance on rate of relapse of pancreaticobiliary IgG4-related disease (Majumder et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2018;16:1947-53). The Committee noted that a higher proportion of patients experience relapse in the group without maintenance therapy (3-year event rate 45% vs 11% with rituximab maintenance therapy; P=0.034). The Committee noted that dosing for the maintenance group was variable, with patients receiving 2 g of rituximab every 2-6 months. The Committee noted that patients in this study who did not experience an adequate therapeutic effect were more likely to have biliary involvement, while patients with classic autoimmune pancreatitis were more likely to experience good effect. The Committee considered that delaying treatment appears to reduce the success of rituximab treatment, with the most benefit seen in patients who have not developed significant fibrosis at the time of rituximab treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the following evidence for rituximab for the treatment of IgG4- related disease:</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">• Maritati et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59(Suppl 3):iii123-iii131</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">• Detiger et al. Acta Ophthalmol. 2019;97:451-59</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">• Betancur-Vásquez et al.

Oncotarget. 2018;9:21337-47</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence of effectiveness for rituximab in IgG4- related disease was of weak to moderate quality, noting rituximab is often trialled in patients with a wide range of uncommon autoimmune conditions in small cohort and case studies, and considered that it is unlikely that any large-scale clinical trials will be published in these populations due to low patient numbers. However, the Committee considered there was strong biological plausibility of effect and likelihood for response of rituximab in the treatment of IgG4-related disease, particularly compared with currently available treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the dosing of rituximab for IgG4-related disease should not exceed 2000 mg every six months and considered that 1000 mg every six months is likely to be sufficient for most patients, noting that the evidence suggests that there may be a clinically significant benefit for maintenance treatment in preventing relapse. The Committee considered that if rituximab were to be funded for IgG4-related disease, there may be a reduction in long term disease progression for some patients including organ damage in pancreatic, renal, aortic, and liver disease, as well as the possibility of reduction in incidence of diabetes associated with systemic corticosteroid treatment, and that this would be of benefit to the health system. Members acknowledged there is a lack of evidence to confirm reduction in long term organ damage.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it would be beneficial for patients to be treated with rituximab as soon as possible if relapse occurs following initial corticosteroid treatment, due to the toxicity associated with long-term use of the alternative agents (corticosteroids and immunomodulators). The Committee noted that rituximab is associated with some adverse events but considered that these are well known and manageable.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the optimal number of courses and dose of rituximab for the treatment of IgG4-related disease is unknown, due to the variable dosing schedules in rituximab trials for various indications; noted that in some settings that patients receive rituximab re-treatment only at relapse; and considered that rituximab may be used similarly in the setting of IgG4-related disease. The Committee considered that as the evidence for the benefit associated with maintenance rituximab continues to develop, more patients may seek maintenance treatment 6 monthly, for a durable response. The Committee noted that patients who relapse early in the treatment cycle would typically be re-treated initially, however if relapse continues to occur shortly after treatment with rituximab this would indicate poor response to treatment prompting cessation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the information included in the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information table is realistic for rituximab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for IgG4- related disease. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000007JfDd&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001V7Qv"" alt=""image.png""></img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee noted that immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) related disease is a recently-recognised immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition of unknown aetiology with a diverse phenotype that can affect multiple organs and body systems, most commonly manifesting as type 1 (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis; sclerosing cholangitis, typically occurring together with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis; salivary gland enlargement or sclerosing sialadenitis similar to Mikulicz disease; orbital disease, often with proptosis; retroperitoneal fibrosis, frequently with chronic periaortitis and often affecting the ureters, leading to hydronephrosis and renal injury.

The Committee noted that 100% of patients undergoing maintenance treatment were relapse-free at 18 months, compared with 29% in the group only treated at relapse (p=0.006).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that one of the most common presentations of IgG4-related disease is autoimmune pancreatitis and noted a Mayo clinic study describing the experience of treating relapsing autoimmune pancreatitis with immunomodulators and rituximab (Hart et al. Gut. 2013;62:1607-15). The Committee noted that during a median follow-up of 47 months, 52 of 116 autoimmune pancreatitis patients, who were all treated with corticosteroids and immunomodulators, experienced 76 relapse episodes. The Committee noted that first relapses were treated with a course of corticosteroids in 24 patients, and with corticosteroids plus immunomodulators in another 27 patients and noted that the subsequent relapse-free survival was similar between the two groups (p=0.23). The Committee noted that 38 patients received an immunomodulator for more than 2 months, and that failure or intolerance of immunomodulator therapy occurred in 45% of patients. The Committee noted that 12 patients with corticosteroid or immunomodulator intolerance/resistance were subsequently treated with rituximab, with 83% of those patients experiencing complete remission without relapse while on maintenance therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a study investigating the clinical phenotypes of IgG4-related disease and how these affect different prognostic outcomes (Lanzillotta et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2020;59:2435-42). The Committee noted that patients with biliary involvement had higher relapse rates than other groups and were more likely to develop diabetes mellitus (in 62%, compared with 7% of patients with retroperitoneum/aortitis disease, 21% of patients with head and neck limited IgG4-related disease, and 31% with Mikulicz/systemic disease).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted another Mayo clinic study investigating the effects of rituximab with or without maintenance on rate of relapse of pancreaticobiliary IgG4-related disease (Majumder et al. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2018;16:1947-53). The Committee noted that a higher proportion of patients experience relapse in the group without maintenance therapy (3-year event rate 45% vs 11% with rituximab maintenance therapy; P=0.034). The Committee noted that dosing for the maintenance group was variable, with patients receiving 2 g of rituximab every 2-6 months. The Committee noted that patients in this study who did not experience an adequate therapeutic effect were more likely to have biliary involvement, while patients with classic autoimmune pancreatitis were more likely to experience good effect. The Committee considered that delaying treatment appears to reduce the success of rituximab treatment, with the most benefit seen in patients who have not developed significant fibrosis at the time of rituximab treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the following evidence for rituximab for the treatment of IgG4- related disease:</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">• Maritati et al.

Oncotarget. 2018;9:21337-47</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence of effectiveness for rituximab in IgG4- related disease was of weak to moderate quality, noting rituximab is often trialled in patients with a wide range of uncommon autoimmune conditions in small cohort and case studies, and considered that it is unlikely that any large-scale clinical trials will be published in these populations due to low patient numbers. However, the Committee considered there was strong biological plausibility of effect and likelihood for response of rituximab in the treatment of IgG4-related disease, particularly compared with currently available treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the dosing of rituximab for IgG4-related disease should not exceed 2000 mg every six months and considered that 1000 mg every six months is likely to be sufficient for most patients, noting that the evidence suggests that there may be a clinically significant benefit for maintenance treatment in preventing relapse. The Committee considered that if rituximab were to be funded for IgG4-related disease, there may be a reduction in long term disease progression for some patients including organ damage in pancreatic, renal, aortic, and liver disease, as well as the possibility of reduction in incidence of diabetes associated with systemic corticosteroid treatment, and that this would be of benefit to the health system. Members acknowledged there is a lack of evidence to confirm reduction in long term organ damage.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it would be beneficial for patients to be treated with rituximab as soon as possible if relapse occurs following initial corticosteroid treatment, due to the toxicity associated with long-term use of the alternative agents (corticosteroids and immunomodulators). The Committee noted that rituximab is associated with some adverse events but considered that these are well known and manageable.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the optimal number of courses and dose of rituximab for the treatment of IgG4-related disease is unknown, due to the variable dosing schedules in rituximab trials for various indications; noted that in some settings that patients receive rituximab re-treatment only at relapse; and considered that rituximab may be used similarly in the setting of IgG4-related disease. The Committee considered that as the evidence for the benefit associated with maintenance rituximab continues to develop, more patients may seek maintenance treatment 6 monthly, for a durable response. The Committee noted that patients who relapse early in the treatment cycle would typically be re-treated initially, however if relapse continues to occur shortly after treatment with rituximab this would indicate poor response to treatment prompting cessation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the information included in the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information table is realistic for rituximab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for IgG4- related disease. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.

The Committee considered that diagnosis of IgG4 related disease was difficult however there was an increasing awareness and the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism have developed a complex classification process which includes a complete list of exclusions and inclusions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that IgG4-affected organs share several core pathologic features and clinical and serologic similarities, including tumour-like swelling, presence of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and a variable degree of fibrosis that has a characteristic &quot;storiform&quot; pattern. The Committee noted that serum IgG4 concentrations can be elevated (defined as &gt;135 mg/dL, &gt;121 mg/dL, or &gt;86 mg/dL depending upon the laboratory) in approximately two-thirds of patients. The Committee considered that the diagnosis usually depends on radiological features noting that serum IgG4 levels cannot be relied on for diagnosis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that IgG4-related disease has historically had low reported incidence, likely related to difficulty in making this diagnosis, however, patient numbers have increased over time with increasing awareness of IgG4-disease, including incorporating reclassification of other diseases. The Committee considered that most epidemiological information regarding IgG4-related disease comes from studies conducted in Japan and China, where incidence is reported to be between 0.3 and 1.0 per 100,000 per year. The Committee considered that, based on this incidence, it is likely that there would be between 15 and 50 new cases per year in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the incidence is likely to be at the lower end of this range but may rise over time as IgG4-related disease becomes more commonly recognized.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that current treatment for IgG4-related disease typically starts with corticosteroids as first-line treatment with disease usually responding rapidly to treatment unless there is significant fibrosis, noting that fibrosis increases in severity if the diagnosis is delayed. The Committee noted loss of disease response is common once corticosteroids are tapered to low doses, and long-term corticosteroid treatment can lead to substantial toxicity, in particular in patients presenting with autoimmune pancreatitis who are at high risk of diabetes. The Committee noted severe disease may require urgent, high dose corticosteroids.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that treatment with conventional immunomodulators (cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate) is considered for patients who cannot tolerate or have not responded to high dose corticosteroids however these have only a modest effect and are associated with significant adverse effects. Committee considered that the health need for patients with IgG4-related disease is high for those with severe illness experiencing frequent relapse.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a non-randomised trial of low-dose (50 to 100 mg per day) cyclophosphamide in combination with corticosteroid in 102 patients with IgG4-related disease, compared with corticosteroid monotherapy (Yunyun et al. Sci Rep. 2017;7:6195). The Committee noted that at one-year follow-up 38.5% of patients receiving corticosteroid monotherapy had relapsed, compared to a 12% in those who also received combination cyclophosphamide. The Committee noted that the corticosteroid regimen resulted in a new diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus in approximately 10% of participants, however low-dose cyclophosphamide was reported to be relatively well tolerated without any events of bone marrow suppression. The Committee noted that there was no attempt to lower corticosteroid doses below 10 mg/day over the course of the trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a randomised non-blinded trial investigating the use of corticosteroid monotherapy compared with combination therapy of corticosteroid with mycophenolate (1000 to 1500 mg/day) in 69 patients with IgG4-related disease (Yunyun et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2019;58:52-60). The Committee noted that patients were more likely to experience remission on combination therapy (76% on combination therapy vs 40% on corticosteroids alone). The Committee noted that this study also made no attempt to lower corticosteroid doses.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a retrospective multicentre study investigating the long-term efficacy and safety of rituximab in IgG4-related disease using data from a French nationwide study of 33 patients treated either with 2 doses of 1000 mg rituximab separated by 15 days (25 patients), 4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 (six patients), and other regimens in 2 patients (4 weekly doses of 150 mg/m2 or 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 separated by 15 days) (Ebbo et al. PLoS One. 2017;12:e0183844). The Committee noted that despite variability in treatment regimen, the durability of clinical remission persisted for at least six months for most patients, and in some cases extended beyond 18 months. The Committee noted that a clinical response was observed in 29 of the 31 patients in the study, and that patients received maintenance treatment, at treating clinician&#39;s discretion, between one to 17 months after initial treatment with rituximab. The Committee noted that the probability of relapse-free survival was higher with rituximab maintenance than without (p=0.016). The Committee noted that there were nine severe infections during the course of the study and no deaths.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a prospective, open-label trial of patients with active disease defined by the IgG4-RD Responder Index treated with two doses of rituximab (1000 mg each dose) (Carruthers et al. Ann Rheum Dis. 2015;74:1171-7). The Committee noted that of the 30 patients included in the study, 27 patients had discontinued corticosteroid use at 12 months, and 60% of patients achieved complete remission. The Committee noted that 19 patients had elevated baseline serum IgG4 concentrations with a mean concentration of 911 mg/dL (range 138–4780 mg/dL), which declined to 422 mg/dL (range 56–2410 mg/dL) at month 6 following rituximab treatment (p&lt;0.05). The Committee noted that 42% of patients in the study achieved normal IgG4 serum levels and considered that these results were unlikely to be achievable with immunomodulator treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a study on the long-term efficacy of maintenance therapy with rituximab for IgG4-related disease in 14 patients either treated on relapse or every 6 months as maintenance (either 1000 or 2000 mg) (Campochiaro et al.
