          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that brentuximab vedotin for relapsed/refractory HL was reviewed by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2016-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2018</a>, where it was recommended for decline due to incomplete evidence, lack of overall survival data, and uncertainty around durability of response and level of benefit. The Subcommittee noted that CaTSoP then reviewed the proposal in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2018</a>. At this meeting it was recommended for funding with a high priority for relapsed/refractory HL following two or more lines of chemotherapy for patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant or have already had an autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab as a \u2018bridge to transplant\u2019 for the treatment for relapsed/refractory HL for individuals eligible for autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, had been previously considered by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP 2019</a>. The Subcommittee noted that this application for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma after two or more lines of chemotherapy for patients who are either ineligible for, or relapsed following, an autologous stem cell transplant had been previously considered by PTAC at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2018</a> meeting.\u00a0PTAC deferred making a recommendation at that time pending updated evidence from KEYNOTE-204 trial and referred the application to CaTSoP, seeking the Subcommittee\u2019s view on the health benefits of pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that it had reviewed this application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2018</a> where it also deferred making a recommendation, pending a comparison of brentuximab with pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that the KEYNOTE-204 trial comparing brentuximab vedotin and pembrolizumab in the patient group for whom funding was requested has since been published (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the prognosis for people with relapsed/refractory HL depends on multiple factors, including; time to relapse, stage of disease at time of relapse, and performance status. The Subcommittee noted that patients with refractory disease, including those who relapse less than three months after completion of treatment, have significantly worse outcomes than those who relapse having previously been in remission for longer periods.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently the first line treatment for people with HL is chemotherapy which has a response rate of approximately 80%. The Subcommittee noted that the 20% of patients who are refractory or relapse following first line chemotherapy will go on to received second-line high dose salvage chemotherapy, which may be followed by autologous-SCT if patients are eligible. The Subcommittee considered patients who had received second line salvage chemotherapy and relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) or are not eligible for auto-SCT had a severe health need as they would not be expected to live beyond 12 months. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10-15 patients per year would be eligible for pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence that HL disproportionately affects M\u0101ori, Pacific people, or those experiencing socioeconomic deprivation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the KEYNOTE-204 trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>), comparing pembrolizumab (n=151) and brentuximab vedotin (n=153) for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory HL post autologous-SCT (approximately a third of participants) or if ineligible for auto-SCT (two thirds of participants). The Subcommittee noted that ineligibility for auto-SCT could depend on chemotherapy-refractory disease, advanced age or the presence of comorbidities. The Subcommittee noted that over 80% of patients included in the trial were under the age of 65 and had received two or more previous lines of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population that was included in this trial was largely representative of the patient population that would access pembrolizumab if funded in New Zealand, although noted that there was a small proportion of patients included in the trial that had previously received brentuximab vedotin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the KEYNOTE-204 trial, the proportion of patients with an objective response was 65.6% in the pembrolizumab treatment group (95% CI 57.4 to 73.1) compared to 54.2% in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (95% CI 46.0 to 62.3). The Subcommittee noted that median progression-free survival was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.9 to19.4) for the pembrolizumab treatment group versus 8.3 months (95% CI 5.7 to 8.8) for the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.65 [95% CI 0\u00b748 to 0\u00b788]; p=0\u00b70027). The Subcommittee noted that for many subgroups, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was in favour of pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab vedotin, including those who had received \u22652 prior lines of treatment (HR: 0.67; [0.49 to 0.92]) and those without prior exposure to brentuximab vedotin (HR: 0.65; [0.48 to 0.88]).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival from this trial was not reported because this endpoint had not been reached. However, the Subcommittee considered that the use of progression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival was reasonable in this patient group given the late stage of the disease and the lack of effective treatments, which indicates that PFS translates quickly into survival status.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in this trial, treatment was to continue for up to two years or 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events for both treatment arms. The Subcommittee considered that this duration was longer than what would be expected for the usual duration of treatment with brentuximab vedotin and noted that only a small portion of patients were still receiving brentuximab vedotin after two years, although acknowledged that and noted that the majority of discontinuations in this treatment arm were due to progression. The Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients in the pembrolizumab treatment arm remained on treatment at the two-year mark. The Subcommittee noted that similar results to that observed for pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE 204 trial, using larger doses for shorter periods, have been reported elsewhere (PFS 69% at 24 weeks and 46% at 52 weeks; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354476/\" target=\"_blank\">Armand et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:3733-39</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile of pembrolizumab was similar to that of brentuximab vedotin, with slightly more patients discontinuing treatment in the brentuximab vedotin arm (25/152 [16%]) compared to the pembrolizumab arm (19/148 [13%]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence supporting the use of pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory HL was of moderate strength and quality, derived from a single trial comparing two currently unfunded agents in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to consider this evidence as relevant to New Zealand, as it had previously recommended funding brentuximab with a high priority.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin with conventional treatment (standard of care in New Zealand), but that there is non-experimental uncontrolled observational evidence suggesting that novel agents such as pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin have significant improvement in median overall survival compared to patients who did not receive novel agents (85.6 vs 17.1 months; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28512788/\" target=\"_blank\">Bair et al. AM J Haematol. 2017;92:879-84</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted two studies regarding pembrolizumab in the treatment of HL previously considered by CaTSoP:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28441111\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al.

Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if pembrolizumab were to be funded for relapsed/refractory HL that some patients ineligible for transplant because of disease refractory to salvage chemotherapy may respond to treatment and become eligible. The Subcommittee considered, however, that the primary reasons for ineligibility for transplant were comorbidities and fitness, therefore, the expected increase in the number of auto-SCTs would be modest if pembrolizumab were funded for this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that there would be no change in the number of allo-SCTs given the uncertainty regarding the impact of funding pembrolizumab on this outcome. The Subcommittee considered that funding of pembrolizumab may incur some additional cost to the health system if more patients become eligible for auto- SCT, but that because pembrolizumab was considerably less toxic than currently funded treatments, there might be decreased cost to the health system associated with the reduced need for supportive care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted two trials comparing brentuximab vedotin to salvage chemotherapies (single arm trials) that reported longer progression-free survival and overall survival with brentuximab vedotin vs standard chemotherapies for transplant ineligible patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017;99:553-8</a>) and patients post auto-SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016;128:1562-6</a>). The Subcommittee noted that in the Chen et al 2016 trial, some patients were in remission after 5 years, and considered that this was indicative of a potentially curative effect of brentuximab vedotin for some patients in this group. The Subcommittee considered that the outcomes and patient population for brentuximab vedotin in the KEYNOTE 204 trial to be similar to that observed in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials; the progression-free survival with brentuximab vedotin was 8.3 months in KEYNOTE-204, compared with 9.3 months in those patients who had relapsed post autologous SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>) and 15.1 months in those ineligible for auto-SCT the (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the significantly different progression free survival observed for pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab in KEYNOTE 204 trial and considered that it would be reasonable to assume that the benefit of pembrolizumab extends beyond that observed for brentuximab (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee considered that in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials, progression free survival aligned closely to overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that a similar relationship could reasonably be inferred for the use of pembrolizumab in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed/refractory HL. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by PHARMAC staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Subcommittee noted that this application for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma after two or more lines of chemotherapy for patients who are either ineligible for, or relapsed following, an autologous stem cell transplant had been previously considered by PTAC at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2018</a> meeting.\u00a0PTAC deferred making a recommendation at that time pending updated evidence from KEYNOTE-204 trial and referred the application to CaTSoP, seeking the Subcommittee\u2019s view on the health benefits of pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that it had reviewed this application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2018</a> where it also deferred making a recommendation, pending a comparison of brentuximab with pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that the KEYNOTE-204 trial comparing brentuximab vedotin and pembrolizumab in the patient group for whom funding was requested has since been published (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the prognosis for people with relapsed/refractory HL depends on multiple factors, including; time to relapse, stage of disease at time of relapse, and performance status. The Subcommittee noted that patients with refractory disease, including those who relapse less than three months after completion of treatment, have significantly worse outcomes than those who relapse having previously been in remission for longer periods.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently the first line treatment for people with HL is chemotherapy which has a response rate of approximately 80%. The Subcommittee noted that the 20% of patients who are refractory or relapse following first line chemotherapy will go on to received second-line high dose salvage chemotherapy, which may be followed by autologous-SCT if patients are eligible. The Subcommittee considered patients who had received second line salvage chemotherapy and relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) or are not eligible for auto-SCT had a severe health need as they would not be expected to live beyond 12 months. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10-15 patients per year would be eligible for pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence that HL disproportionately affects M\u0101ori, Pacific people, or those experiencing socioeconomic deprivation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the KEYNOTE-204 trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>), comparing pembrolizumab (n=151) and brentuximab vedotin (n=153) for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory HL post autologous-SCT (approximately a third of participants) or if ineligible for auto-SCT (two thirds of participants). The Subcommittee noted that ineligibility for auto-SCT could depend on chemotherapy-refractory disease, advanced age or the presence of comorbidities. The Subcommittee noted that over 80% of patients included in the trial were under the age of 65 and had received two or more previous lines of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population that was included in this trial was largely representative of the patient population that would access pembrolizumab if funded in New Zealand, although noted that there was a small proportion of patients included in the trial that had previously received brentuximab vedotin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the KEYNOTE-204 trial, the proportion of patients with an objective response was 65.6% in the pembrolizumab treatment group (95% CI 57.4 to 73.1) compared to 54.2% in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (95% CI 46.0 to 62.3). The Subcommittee noted that median progression-free survival was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.9 to19.4) for the pembrolizumab treatment group versus 8.3 months (95% CI 5.7 to 8.8) for the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.65 [95% CI 0\u00b748 to 0\u00b788]; p=0\u00b70027). The Subcommittee noted that for many subgroups, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was in favour of pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab vedotin, including those who had received \u22652 prior lines of treatment (HR: 0.67; [0.49 to 0.92]) and those without prior exposure to brentuximab vedotin (HR: 0.65; [0.48 to 0.88]).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival from this trial was not reported because this endpoint had not been reached. However, the Subcommittee considered that the use of progression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival was reasonable in this patient group given the late stage of the disease and the lack of effective treatments, which indicates that PFS translates quickly into survival status.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in this trial, treatment was to continue for up to two years or 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events for both treatment arms. The Subcommittee considered that this duration was longer than what would be expected for the usual duration of treatment with brentuximab vedotin and noted that only a small portion of patients were still receiving brentuximab vedotin after two years, although acknowledged that and noted that the majority of discontinuations in this treatment arm were due to progression. The Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients in the pembrolizumab treatment arm remained on treatment at the two-year mark. The Subcommittee noted that similar results to that observed for pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE 204 trial, using larger doses for shorter periods, have been reported elsewhere (PFS 69% at 24 weeks and 46% at 52 weeks; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354476/\" target=\"_blank\">Armand et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:3733-39</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile of pembrolizumab was similar to that of brentuximab vedotin, with slightly more patients discontinuing treatment in the brentuximab vedotin arm (25/152 [16%]) compared to the pembrolizumab arm (19/148 [13%]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence supporting the use of pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory HL was of moderate strength and quality, derived from a single trial comparing two currently unfunded agents in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to consider this evidence as relevant to New Zealand, as it had previously recommended funding brentuximab with a high priority.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin with conventional treatment (standard of care in New Zealand), but that there is non-experimental uncontrolled observational evidence suggesting that novel agents such as pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin have significant improvement in median overall survival compared to patients who did not receive novel agents (85.6 vs 17.1 months; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28512788/\" target=\"_blank\">Bair et al.

Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if pembrolizumab were to be funded for relapsed/refractory HL that some patients ineligible for transplant because of disease refractory to salvage chemotherapy may respond to treatment and become eligible. The Subcommittee considered, however, that the primary reasons for ineligibility for transplant were comorbidities and fitness, therefore, the expected increase in the number of auto-SCTs would be modest if pembrolizumab were funded for this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that there would be no change in the number of allo-SCTs given the uncertainty regarding the impact of funding pembrolizumab on this outcome. The Subcommittee considered that funding of pembrolizumab may incur some additional cost to the health system if more patients become eligible for auto- SCT, but that because pembrolizumab was considerably less toxic than currently funded treatments, there might be decreased cost to the health system associated with the reduced need for supportive care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted two trials comparing brentuximab vedotin to salvage chemotherapies (single arm trials) that reported longer progression-free survival and overall survival with brentuximab vedotin vs standard chemotherapies for transplant ineligible patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017;99:553-8</a>) and patients post auto-SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016;128:1562-6</a>). The Subcommittee noted that in the Chen et al 2016 trial, some patients were in remission after 5 years, and considered that this was indicative of a potentially curative effect of brentuximab vedotin for some patients in this group. The Subcommittee considered that the outcomes and patient population for brentuximab vedotin in the KEYNOTE 204 trial to be similar to that observed in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials; the progression-free survival with brentuximab vedotin was 8.3 months in KEYNOTE-204, compared with 9.3 months in those patients who had relapsed post autologous SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>) and 15.1 months in those ineligible for auto-SCT the (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the significantly different progression free survival observed for pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab in KEYNOTE 204 trial and considered that it would be reasonable to assume that the benefit of pembrolizumab extends beyond that observed for brentuximab (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee considered that in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials, progression free survival aligned closely to overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that a similar relationship could reasonably be inferred for the use of pembrolizumab in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed/refractory HL. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by PHARMAC staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Subcommittee noted that it had reviewed this application in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2018</a> where it also deferred making a recommendation, pending a comparison of brentuximab with pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that the KEYNOTE-204 trial comparing brentuximab vedotin and pembrolizumab in the patient group for whom funding was requested has since been published (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the prognosis for people with relapsed/refractory HL depends on multiple factors, including; time to relapse, stage of disease at time of relapse, and performance status. The Subcommittee noted that patients with refractory disease, including those who relapse less than three months after completion of treatment, have significantly worse outcomes than those who relapse having previously been in remission for longer periods.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently the first line treatment for people with HL is chemotherapy which has a response rate of approximately 80%. The Subcommittee noted that the 20% of patients who are refractory or relapse following first line chemotherapy will go on to received second-line high dose salvage chemotherapy, which may be followed by autologous-SCT if patients are eligible. The Subcommittee considered patients who had received second line salvage chemotherapy and relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) or are not eligible for auto-SCT had a severe health need as they would not be expected to live beyond 12 months. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10-15 patients per year would be eligible for pembrolizumab in this setting. The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence that HL disproportionately affects M\u0101ori, Pacific people, or those experiencing socioeconomic deprivation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the KEYNOTE-204 trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33721562/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuruvilla et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a>), comparing pembrolizumab (n=151) and brentuximab vedotin (n=153) for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory HL post autologous-SCT (approximately a third of participants) or if ineligible for auto-SCT (two thirds of participants). The Subcommittee noted that ineligibility for auto-SCT could depend on chemotherapy-refractory disease, advanced age or the presence of comorbidities. The Subcommittee noted that over 80% of patients included in the trial were under the age of 65 and had received two or more previous lines of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the patient population that was included in this trial was largely representative of the patient population that would access pembrolizumab if funded in New Zealand, although noted that there was a small proportion of patients included in the trial that had previously received brentuximab vedotin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the KEYNOTE-204 trial, the proportion of patients with an objective response was 65.6% in the pembrolizumab treatment group (95% CI 57.4 to 73.1) compared to 54.2% in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (95% CI 46.0 to 62.3). The Subcommittee noted that median progression-free survival was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.9 to19.4) for the pembrolizumab treatment group versus 8.3 months (95% CI 5.7 to 8.8) for the brentuximab vedotin treatment group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.65 [95% CI 0\u00b748 to 0\u00b788]; p=0\u00b70027). The Subcommittee noted that for many subgroups, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was in favour of pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab vedotin, including those who had received \u22652 prior lines of treatment (HR: 0.67; [0.49 to 0.92]) and those without prior exposure to brentuximab vedotin (HR: 0.65; [0.48 to 0.88]).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival from this trial was not reported because this endpoint had not been reached. However, the Subcommittee considered that the use of progression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival was reasonable in this patient group given the late stage of the disease and the lack of effective treatments, which indicates that PFS translates quickly into survival status.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in this trial, treatment was to continue for up to two years or 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events for both treatment arms. The Subcommittee considered that this duration was longer than what would be expected for the usual duration of treatment with brentuximab vedotin and noted that only a small portion of patients were still receiving brentuximab vedotin after two years, although acknowledged that and noted that the majority of discontinuations in this treatment arm were due to progression. The Subcommittee noted that a greater proportion of patients in the pembrolizumab treatment arm remained on treatment at the two-year mark. The Subcommittee noted that similar results to that observed for pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE 204 trial, using larger doses for shorter periods, have been reported elsewhere (PFS 69% at 24 weeks and 46% at 52 weeks; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354476/\" target=\"_blank\">Armand et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:3733-39</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the safety profile of pembrolizumab was similar to that of brentuximab vedotin, with slightly more patients discontinuing treatment in the brentuximab vedotin arm (25/152 [16%]) compared to the pembrolizumab arm (19/148 [13%]).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence supporting the use of pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory HL was of moderate strength and quality, derived from a single trial comparing two currently unfunded agents in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to consider this evidence as relevant to New Zealand, as it had previously recommended funding brentuximab with a high priority.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no direct evidence comparing pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin with conventional treatment (standard of care in New Zealand), but that there is non-experimental uncontrolled observational evidence suggesting that novel agents such as pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin have significant improvement in median overall survival compared to patients who did not receive novel agents (85.6 vs 17.1 months; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28512788/\" target=\"_blank\">Bair et al. AM J Haematol. 2017;92:879-84</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted two studies regarding pembrolizumab in the treatment of HL previously considered by CaTSoP:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28441111\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al.

Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:512-24</a></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if pembrolizumab were to be funded for relapsed/refractory HL that some patients ineligible for transplant because of disease refractory to salvage chemotherapy may respond to treatment and become eligible. The Subcommittee considered, however, that the primary reasons for ineligibility for transplant were comorbidities and fitness, therefore, the expected increase in the number of auto-SCTs would be modest if pembrolizumab were funded for this patient group. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to assume that there would be no change in the number of allo-SCTs given the uncertainty regarding the impact of funding pembrolizumab on this outcome. The Subcommittee considered that funding of pembrolizumab may incur some additional cost to the health system if more patients become eligible for auto- SCT, but that because pembrolizumab was considerably less toxic than currently funded treatments, there might be decreased cost to the health system associated with the reduced need for supportive care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted two trials comparing brentuximab vedotin to salvage chemotherapies (single arm trials) that reported longer progression-free survival and overall survival with brentuximab vedotin vs standard chemotherapies for transplant ineligible patients (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017;99:553-8</a>) and patients post auto-SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016;128:1562-6</a>). The Subcommittee noted that in the Chen et al 2016 trial, some patients were in remission after 5 years, and considered that this was indicative of a potentially curative effect of brentuximab vedotin for some patients in this group. The Subcommittee considered that the outcomes and patient population for brentuximab vedotin in the KEYNOTE 204 trial to be similar to that observed in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials; the progression-free survival with brentuximab vedotin was 8.3 months in KEYNOTE-204, compared with 9.3 months in those patients who had relapsed post autologous SCT (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>) and 15.1 months in those ineligible for auto-SCT the (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the significantly different progression free survival observed for pembrolizumab compared to brentuximab in KEYNOTE 204 trial and considered that it would be reasonable to assume that the benefit of pembrolizumab extends beyond that observed for brentuximab (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034737/\" target=\"_blank\">Chen et al. Blood. 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949403/\" target=\"_blank\">Brockelmann et al. Eur J Haematol. 2017</a>). The Subcommittee considered that in the Chen et al. 2016 and Brockelmann et al. trials, progression free survival aligned closely to overall survival. The Subcommittee considered that a similar relationship could reasonably be inferred for the use of pembrolizumab in this setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for relapsed/refractory HL. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by PHARMAC staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.
