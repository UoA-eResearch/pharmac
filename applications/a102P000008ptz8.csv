At this time, the Subcommittee considered that the evidence available demonstrated that prucalopride provided a modest but clinically significant benefit for\xa0</span>patients with severe chronic constipation and recommended that prucalopride be funded with a medium priority. The Committee reviewed these minutes in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"">February 2019</a> and considered that the population described by the proposed Special Authority criteria was potentially very large, and that the evidence reviewed suggested only a modest effect.

The Committee noted that slow transit constipation is the least prevalent subtype.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available regarding the prevalence of slow-transit constipation in New Zealand.
