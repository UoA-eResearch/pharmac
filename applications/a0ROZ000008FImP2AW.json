The Subcommittee noted that there are currently no pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that are approved for use as AIR therapy with or without maintenance, but considered that the registration status for these products for use in these particular indications was not a particular concern clinically.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that asthma exacerbations pose a significant cost to the healthcare system and as well as to patients, family, and wh\u0101nau. The Subcommittee noted that an urgent GP visit for an adult, depending on location, can cost up to $100 per visit, and that exacerbations that result in hospitalisation can cost the health system upwards of $3,000.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Budesonide/eformoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a request for information by PHARMAC staff regarding the use of budesonide/eformoterol dry powder inhalers for the treatment of asthma in light of the <a href=\"https://www.nzrespiratoryguidelines.co.nz/uploads/8/3/0/1/83014052/arfnz_adolescent_and_adult_asthma_guidelines_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Update of the NZ Adolescent and Adult Asthma guidelines</a>. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of patients receiving budesonide/eformoterol DPIs suffer from asthma, and only a small proportion of patients receive budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for the relief of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in October 2020, Teva\u2019s budesonide with eformoterol inhaler (DuoResp Spiromax) was listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule alongside the Symbicort Turbuhaler, both of which are approved for use as AIR therapy with or without maintenance (DuoResp Spiromax being only approved as AIR therapy for adults, while Symbicort Turbuhaler is approved in ages 12 years and over for AIR without maintenance and in the 100/6 strength is approved in ages 4 years and over for AIR with maintenance). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in practice the 100/6 strength of the Symbicort Turbuhaler is often used to treat children under the age of 12 years. The Subcommittee noted that the 200/6 strength formulation, available in both brands, is also occasionally used in children aged under 12. The Subcommittee noted that DuoResp Spiromax is not currently approved for AIR therapy with or without maintenance for patients under the age of 18, but that a decision by Medsafe whether to approve for adolescent patients is expected in 2021. The Subcommittee considered that the appropriate age cut-off for this inhaler should be 12 years old, as there is no 100/6 strength of DuoResp Spiromax at this time.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the currently available strengths of budesonide/eformoterol dry powder inhalers are 200/6 and 400/12 for DuoResp Spiromax, and 100/6, 200/6, and 400/12 for Symbicort Turbuhaler. The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation. The Subcommittee considered that if not available, this would reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the 400/12 strength of budesonide/eformoterol as reliever therapy in primary care. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that current practice with salbutamol pMDIs is that they are dispensed in large quantities so that patients can receive multiple inhalers per dispensing. The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner\u2019s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/\" target=\"_blank\">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the annualised exacerbation rate was lower for the AIR therapy group than that of the salbutamol group (absolute rate, 0.195 vs. 0.400; relative rate 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.72; p&lt;0.001) and that the number of severe exacerbations was reduced in the AIR therapy group compared with the salbutamol only group. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of AIR therapy was that in mild asthma it would reduce the annualised exacerbation rate and the number of severe exacerbations compared to salbutamol-only therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was important to incorporate baseline exacerbation rates into any analysis of the impact of AIR therapy, as a direct comparison between trial arms could over-estimate true rates due to the variation in exacerbation rates between arms at baseline.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if budesonide/eformoterol were to be funded in New Zealand stat for AIR therapy in patients with mild asthma, the most appropriate comparator would be currently funded SABA treatments.

The Subcommittee considered that availability of AIR therapy could be a driver for transitioning patients from their reliance on SABA inhalers to budesonide/eformoterol, which is safer and more effective at reducing exacerbations. The Subcommittee also considered that funding decisions should minimise barriers for patients and clinicians to adhere to the updated treatment guidelines. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that budesonide/eformoterol DPIs and pMDIs could replace the use of SABA and ICS inhalers, but that they could potentially be used incorrectly in combination with SABA and other ICS if patients were confused about inhaler use.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the paradigm shift from using SABA reliever inhalers alone for the treatment of mild asthma to using budesonide/eformoterol inhalers for symptom relief could see a large proportion of current SABA-only patients shift to budesonide/eformoterol products for symptom relief over 5-years. The Subcommittee considered that the PHARMAC estimate of 8% uptake per annum, which was based on the uptake of SMART therapies earlier, was likely too low, as advocacy and health sector support for AIR therapy is strong, and AIR is a simpler regimen than SMART. However, the Subcommittee considered that it is unclear how many patients would transition from SABA-only therapy to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy, given previous experience with salbutamol generic transitions. The Subcommittee noted that some patients are loyal to a certain product and in many cases are willing to pay an extra part charge per dispensing to maintain treatment with their current branded therapy, which could mean that some patients will resist switching from SABA-only to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be cost saving to the health system from reduced exacerbations as a result of AIR vs SABA-only therapy.

The Subcommittee also considered that, during the phase-out of SABA-only use in favour of AIR, costs to the combined pharmaceutical budget will escalate in the interim due to the higher price of AIR treatment options compared with SABA inhalers. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients are likely to require more than two inhalers per dispensing in order to keep inhalers in more than one location in case exacerbations were acute and severe. The Subcommittee considered that a clinician would typically be comfortable with prescribing 6 months\u2019 supply to a patient deemed to be well managed on current therapy, if this meant they would be able to store inhalers at more than one location. The Subcommittee considered however that this would also contribute to greater potential wastage of a product with a shorter shelf-life.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Future procurement process for budesonide/eformoterol</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the record of the Respiratory Procurement Advisory Group meeting (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PRAG-Record-2019-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2019</a>). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to retain both 100/6 and 200/6 strengths after any commercial process regarding budesonide/eformoterol inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that having both strengths available is important regardless of whether the inhalers are DPIs or pMDIs, and that having multiple strengths makes it easier for prescribers and patients to individualise dosing for their specific needs. The Subcommittee however considered that the inclusion of the high strength (400/12) formulation in a future procurement process was not necessary. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some patients may find it difficult to transition to a new or different brand of inhaler, due to confusion about how to use the inhaler, which is especially the case with the elderly and patients currently using multiple inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that similarity between devices and methods of administration of the medicine, as well as the formulation, would be important to consider during any transition to a sole supply arrangement. The Subcommittee considered that a six-month transition period would be an appropriate amount of time to transition patients from different budesonide/eformoterol formulations to a single budesonide/eformoterol inhaler for AIR with or without maintenance. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that prescriber and patient education will be important if patients are to be transitioned onto different brands, in order to limit the nocebo effect, and that similarity of use between old and new brands will aid with familiarity and therefore adherence to treatment. The Subcommittee noted the importance of engaging with organisations and key stakeholders, such as GPs, pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of NZ, and asthma nurses, who play a key role in asthma education and dispensing of asthma medication. The Subcommittee considered that if a single generic brand was funded as the result of a commercial process, it would be important for prescribers and pharmacy to provide education to patients, in particular when historically there has been little supplier-provided education to inform past switches. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, when evaluating different types of inhalers, it is important that variation in both the delivery device and the formulation be taken into account (eg. that there may be more variation in some cases within groups of inhalers [DPIs or pMDIs] than between DPIs and pMDIs). The Subcommittee considered that splitting inhalers into the categories, such as DPIs and pMDIs, can be of limited practical clinical relevance, given the variation within categories.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the preferred commercial approach for budesonide/eformoterol DPIs would include principal supply status, and that it would be important to allow some patients to remain on their previous inhaler by virtue of the discretionary variance allowance. The Subcommittee considered that an allowance of up to 5% would be appropriate for this transition. The Subcommittee considered that patient and clinician education will be key in transitioning patients to ensure similarity and familiarity of use to aid with adherence. The Subcommittee noted that inhaler technique training specific to the new devices would be important for transitioning patients.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that the 200/6 strength formulation, available in both brands, is also occasionally used in children aged under 12. The Subcommittee noted that DuoResp Spiromax is not currently approved for AIR therapy with or without maintenance for patients under the age of 18, but that a decision by Medsafe whether to approve for adolescent patients is expected in 2021.

The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation.

The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner\u2019s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/\" target=\"_blank\">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the comparator for dosage and usage calculations when extrapolating the usage from the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31112386/\" target=\"_blank\">Beasley et al</a> trial to the New Zealand population would the LABA component in budesonide/formoterol treatment options, as it is the most appropriate surrogate for symptom relief when a SABA is used as the comparator. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451207/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardy et al.</a> trial, which indicated that the annualised rate of exacerbations for AIR therapy was less than that of maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline as needed (0\u00b7119 vs 0\u00b7172; relative rate 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b748 to 1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768149/\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Byrne et al</a> trial, which indicated that the mean percentage of weeks with well controlled asthma for patients using AIR therapy was superior to terbutaline (SABA) used as needed (34.4% vs. 31.1% of weeks; odds ratio 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30; p=0.046).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768147/\" target=\"_blank\">Bateman et al</a> trial, which indicated that annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations for AIR therapy was non-inferior to budesonide/eformoterol maintenance plus terbutaline as needed.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence to support the use of AIR therapy with or without maintenance was strong and of good quality, and was of particular relevance to the New Zealand population, with the recent update to the adult and adolescent asthma guidelines, as many of these trials were performed in New Zealand centres.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Summary</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is likely high use of SABA pMDI only in M\u0101ori and Pacific populations, who are disproportionately affected by asthma, and that there is a higher need for AIR therapy options for these groups. The Subcommittee considered that availability of AIR therapy could be a driver for transitioning patients from their reliance on SABA inhalers to budesonide/eformoterol, which is safer and more effective at reducing exacerbations. The Subcommittee also considered that funding decisions should minimise barriers for patients and clinicians to adhere to the updated treatment guidelines. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that budesonide/eformoterol DPIs and pMDIs could replace the use of SABA and ICS inhalers, but that they could potentially be used incorrectly in combination with SABA and other ICS if patients were confused about inhaler use.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the paradigm shift from using SABA reliever inhalers alone for the treatment of mild asthma to using budesonide/eformoterol inhalers for symptom relief could see a large proportion of current SABA-only patients shift to budesonide/eformoterol products for symptom relief over 5-years. The Subcommittee considered that the PHARMAC estimate of 8% uptake per annum, which was based on the uptake of SMART therapies earlier, was likely too low, as advocacy and health sector support for AIR therapy is strong, and AIR is a simpler regimen than SMART. However, the Subcommittee considered that it is unclear how many patients would transition from SABA-only therapy to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy, given previous experience with salbutamol generic transitions. The Subcommittee noted that some patients are loyal to a certain product and in many cases are willing to pay an extra part charge per dispensing to maintain treatment with their current branded therapy, which could mean that some patients will resist switching from SABA-only to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be cost saving to the health system from reduced exacerbations as a result of AIR vs SABA-only therapy. The Subcommittee noted the absolute reduction in severe exacerbations from the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31112386/\" target=\"_blank\">Beasley et al</a> trial. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered it would be important to consider the potential savings from less repeat dispensing of ICS with salbutamol when salbutamol is the only part of the dispensed treatment being used by patients, as this may be very common.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that SABA-only as a reliever treatment will still be used by emergency services and in hospital ICUs, and that GPs may still prescribe SABA for use as needed. The Subcommittee also considered that, during the phase-out of SABA-only use in favour of AIR, costs to the combined pharmaceutical budget will escalate in the interim due to the higher price of AIR treatment options compared with SABA inhalers. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients are likely to require more than two inhalers per dispensing in order to keep inhalers in more than one location in case exacerbations were acute and severe. The Subcommittee considered that a clinician would typically be comfortable with prescribing 6 months\u2019 supply to a patient deemed to be well managed on current therapy, if this meant they would be able to store inhalers at more than one location. The Subcommittee considered however that this would also contribute to greater potential wastage of a product with a shorter shelf-life.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Future procurement process for budesonide/eformoterol</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the record of the Respiratory Procurement Advisory Group meeting (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PRAG-Record-2019-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2019</a>). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to retain both 100/6 and 200/6 strengths after any commercial process regarding budesonide/eformoterol inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that having both strengths available is important regardless of whether the inhalers are DPIs or pMDIs, and that having multiple strengths makes it easier for prescribers and patients to individualise dosing for their specific needs. The Subcommittee however considered that the inclusion of the high strength (400/12) formulation in a future procurement process was not necessary. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some patients may find it difficult to transition to a new or different brand of inhaler, due to confusion about how to use the inhaler, which is especially the case with the elderly and patients currently using multiple inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that similarity between devices and methods of administration of the medicine, as well as the formulation, would be important to consider during any transition to a sole supply arrangement. The Subcommittee considered that a six-month transition period would be an appropriate amount of time to transition patients from different budesonide/eformoterol formulations to a single budesonide/eformoterol inhaler for AIR with or without maintenance. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that prescriber and patient education will be important if patients are to be transitioned onto different brands, in order to limit the nocebo effect, and that similarity of use between old and new brands will aid with familiarity and therefore adherence to treatment. The Subcommittee noted the importance of engaging with organisations and key stakeholders, such as GPs, pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of NZ, and asthma nurses, who play a key role in asthma education and dispensing of asthma medication. The Subcommittee considered that if a single generic brand was funded as the result of a commercial process, it would be important for prescribers and pharmacy to provide education to patients, in particular when historically there has been little supplier-provided education to inform past switches. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, when evaluating different types of inhalers, it is important that variation in both the delivery device and the formulation be taken into account (eg. that there may be more variation in some cases within groups of inhalers [DPIs or pMDIs] than between DPIs and pMDIs). The Subcommittee considered that splitting inhalers into the categories, such as DPIs and pMDIs, can be of limited practical clinical relevance, given the variation within categories.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the preferred commercial approach for budesonide/eformoterol DPIs would include principal supply status, and that it would be important to allow some patients to remain on their previous inhaler by virtue of the discretionary variance allowance. The Subcommittee considered that an allowance of up to 5% would be appropriate for this transition. The Subcommittee considered that patient and clinician education will be key in transitioning patients to ensure similarity and familiarity of use to aid with adherence. The Subcommittee noted that inhaler technique training specific to the new devices would be important for transitioning patients.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that the 400/12 strength dose is rarely used in primary care, and considered that there is a risk of it being used for AIR therapy with or without maintenance, which is inappropriate due to the high ICS and LABA dose administered during each actuation. The Subcommittee considered that prescribing lower doses provides more flexibility with dosing without the concern of high doses of steroids being prescribed and taken inappropriately as reliever therapy. The Subcommittee considered that the high dose formulation (400/12) was not required as patients could sufficiently obtain the equivalent dose from two inhalations of the 200/6 strength formulation. The Subcommittee considered that if not available, this would reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the 400/12 strength of budesonide/eformoterol as reliever therapy in primary care. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that current practice with salbutamol pMDIs is that they are dispensed in large quantities so that patients can receive multiple inhalers per dispensing. The Subcommittee also noted that, in light of the recent updates to the NZ asthma guidelines for mild-moderate asthma, PHARMAC has been requested to makes a change to enable an increase in the dispensing quantities, frequencies and funding of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers to align with this shift in treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that a change to enable stat dispensing would help facilitate this change and align with the new guidelines. The Subcommittee noted that enabling stat dispensing of budesonide/eformoterol would allow patients to have multiple inhalers in different locations, similar to what members considered occurs now with salbutamol pMDIs. The Subcommittee considered that this change could potentially lead to wastage of budesonide/eformoterol inhalers but clinically would reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. In addition, the Subcommittee also considered that enabling primary care providers to provide budesonide/eformoterol on a practitioner\u2019s supply order would help facilitate implementation of the update 2020 update to the guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the Symbicort Turbuhaler has a shelf-life of 24 months, and that the supplier had indicated that there is no separate shelf-life once opened. The Subcommittee also noted that the DuoResp Spiromax has a 36-month shelf-life, however the datasheet indicates that the product must be used within 6 months of opening. The Subcommittee noted that patients with mild asthma who do not need to use their inhalers as AIR therapy regularly would likely stockpile these without keeping track of when they were opened or when they expire, resulting in the use of expired inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that there are potential stability issues with DPIs, but there is insufficient data on shelf-life stability of these inhalers to know if their efficacy reduces appreciably once expired. The Subcommittee considered that if an expired inhaler was delivering 80% of the expected dose that this would still be beneficial to patients using AIR therapy, and that patients would likely slightly increase their weekly dose or number of actuations as necessary to compensate. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted five trials providing evidence for the use of budesonide/eformoterol DPIs for AIR and AIR plus maintenance therapy:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009588/\" target=\"_blank\">Balang et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the annualised exacerbation rate was lower for the AIR therapy group than that of the salbutamol group (absolute rate, 0.195 vs. 0.400; relative rate 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.72; p&lt;0.001) and that the number of severe exacerbations was reduced in the AIR therapy group compared with the salbutamol only group. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of AIR therapy was that in mild asthma it would reduce the annualised exacerbation rate and the number of severe exacerbations compared to salbutamol-only therapy. However, the Subcommittee considered that it was important to incorporate baseline exacerbation rates into any analysis of the impact of AIR therapy, as a direct comparison between trial arms could over-estimate true rates due to the variation in exacerbation rates between arms at baseline.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if budesonide/eformoterol were to be funded in New Zealand stat for AIR therapy in patients with mild asthma, the most appropriate comparator would be currently funded SABA treatments. The Subcommittee considered that the comparator for dosage and usage calculations when extrapolating the usage from the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31112386/\" target=\"_blank\">Beasley et al</a> trial to the New Zealand population would the LABA component in budesonide/formoterol treatment options, as it is the most appropriate surrogate for symptom relief when a SABA is used as the comparator. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451207/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardy et al.</a> trial, which indicated that the annualised rate of exacerbations for AIR therapy was less than that of maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline as needed (0\u00b7119 vs 0\u00b7172; relative rate 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b748 to 1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768149/\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Byrne et al</a> trial, which indicated that the mean percentage of weeks with well controlled asthma for patients using AIR therapy was superior to terbutaline (SABA) used as needed (34.4% vs. 31.1% of weeks; odds ratio 1.14; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30; p=0.046).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the results of the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768147/\" target=\"_blank\">Bateman et al</a> trial, which indicated that annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations for AIR therapy was non-inferior to budesonide/eformoterol maintenance plus terbutaline as needed.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence to support the use of AIR therapy with or without maintenance was strong and of good quality, and was of particular relevance to the New Zealand population, with the recent update to the adult and adolescent asthma guidelines, as many of these trials were performed in New Zealand centres.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Summary</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is likely high use of SABA pMDI only in M\u0101ori and Pacific populations, who are disproportionately affected by asthma, and that there is a higher need for AIR therapy options for these groups. The Subcommittee considered that availability of AIR therapy could be a driver for transitioning patients from their reliance on SABA inhalers to budesonide/eformoterol, which is safer and more effective at reducing exacerbations. The Subcommittee also considered that funding decisions should minimise barriers for patients and clinicians to adhere to the updated treatment guidelines. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that budesonide/eformoterol DPIs and pMDIs could replace the use of SABA and ICS inhalers, but that they could potentially be used incorrectly in combination with SABA and other ICS if patients were confused about inhaler use.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the paradigm shift from using SABA reliever inhalers alone for the treatment of mild asthma to using budesonide/eformoterol inhalers for symptom relief could see a large proportion of current SABA-only patients shift to budesonide/eformoterol products for symptom relief over 5-years. The Subcommittee considered that the PHARMAC estimate of 8% uptake per annum, which was based on the uptake of SMART therapies earlier, was likely too low, as advocacy and health sector support for AIR therapy is strong, and AIR is a simpler regimen than SMART. However, the Subcommittee considered that it is unclear how many patients would transition from SABA-only therapy to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy, given previous experience with salbutamol generic transitions. The Subcommittee noted that some patients are loyal to a certain product and in many cases are willing to pay an extra part charge per dispensing to maintain treatment with their current branded therapy, which could mean that some patients will resist switching from SABA-only to budesonide/eformoterol based AIR therapy.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there would be cost saving to the health system from reduced exacerbations as a result of AIR vs SABA-only therapy.

The Subcommittee also considered that, during the phase-out of SABA-only use in favour of AIR, costs to the combined pharmaceutical budget will escalate in the interim due to the higher price of AIR treatment options compared with SABA inhalers. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients are likely to require more than two inhalers per dispensing in order to keep inhalers in more than one location in case exacerbations were acute and severe. The Subcommittee considered that a clinician would typically be comfortable with prescribing 6 months\u2019 supply to a patient deemed to be well managed on current therapy, if this meant they would be able to store inhalers at more than one location. The Subcommittee considered however that this would also contribute to greater potential wastage of a product with a shorter shelf-life.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Future procurement process for budesonide/eformoterol</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.1.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the record of the Respiratory Procurement Advisory Group meeting (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PRAG-Record-2019-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2019</a>). </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be important to retain both 100/6 and 200/6 strengths after any commercial process regarding budesonide/eformoterol inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that having both strengths available is important regardless of whether the inhalers are DPIs or pMDIs, and that having multiple strengths makes it easier for prescribers and patients to individualise dosing for their specific needs. The Subcommittee however considered that the inclusion of the high strength (400/12) formulation in a future procurement process was not necessary. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that some patients may find it difficult to transition to a new or different brand of inhaler, due to confusion about how to use the inhaler, which is especially the case with the elderly and patients currently using multiple inhalers. The Subcommittee considered that similarity between devices and methods of administration of the medicine, as well as the formulation, would be important to consider during any transition to a sole supply arrangement. The Subcommittee considered that a six-month transition period would be an appropriate amount of time to transition patients from different budesonide/eformoterol formulations to a single budesonide/eformoterol inhaler for AIR with or without maintenance. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that prescriber and patient education will be important if patients are to be transitioned onto different brands, in order to limit the nocebo effect, and that similarity of use between old and new brands will aid with familiarity and therefore adherence to treatment. The Subcommittee noted the importance of engaging with organisations and key stakeholders, such as GPs, pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of NZ, and asthma nurses, who play a key role in asthma education and dispensing of asthma medication. The Subcommittee considered that if a single generic brand was funded as the result of a commercial process, it would be important for prescribers and pharmacy to provide education to patients, in particular when historically there has been little supplier-provided education to inform past switches. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, when evaluating different types of inhalers, it is important that variation in both the delivery device and the formulation be taken into account (eg. that there may be more variation in some cases within groups of inhalers [DPIs or pMDIs] than between DPIs and pMDIs). The Subcommittee considered that splitting inhalers into the categories, such as DPIs and pMDIs, can be of limited practical clinical relevance, given the variation within categories.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the preferred commercial approach for budesonide/eformoterol DPIs would include principal supply status, and that it would be important to allow some patients to remain on their previous inhaler by virtue of the discretionary variance allowance. The Subcommittee considered that an allowance of up to 5% would be appropriate for this transition. The Subcommittee considered that patient and clinician education will be key in transitioning patients to ensure similarity and familiarity of use to aid with adherence. The Subcommittee noted that inhaler technique training specific to the new devices would be important for transitioning patients.</p>",
