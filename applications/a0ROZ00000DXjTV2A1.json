The Committee noted that M\u0101ori are significantly disproportionately represented and that approximately 5.8% of w\u0101hine M\u0101ori with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. The Committee also noted that breast-cancer specific survival (ie only including those who died of breast cancer) was 84% at 10 years for w\u0101hine M\u0101ori, compared to 87% for those of European ethnicity (Te R\u0113hita Mate \u016ataetae - Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>). </p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the application from Breast\u00a0Cancer\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0Coalition (BCAC) for the use of eribulin for the treatment of individuals with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (HER-2 negative and triple negative breast cancers) who have progressed after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease. The Committee noted that eribulin has not been previously considered for any indication. </p><h2><strong>Health need </strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advanced breast cancer includes both locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer and is classified as being Stage IV. It is the most advanced stage of breast cancer and that breast cancers can contain any of the three major receptors often found in breast cancer: oestrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor. The Committee noted that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells do not present with any of the three receptors. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that according to a <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/3120/1/bcfnz-abc-report-2018-reprint-10.2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018 report by Breast Cancer Foundation NZ</a>, approximately 350 New Zealanders are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer per year. The Committee noted that it is unclear if this also includes those who progress to an advanced stage of disease following an earlier diagnosis. The Committee noted that approximately 84% of breast cancers are HER2-negative, equating to 294 of the advanced breast cancers diagnosed annually. The Committee noted that men can also develop breast cancer but considered that the numbers were uncertain. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that approximately 5.8% of w\u0101hine M\u0101ori living with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage, compared to 4.7% of those of European ethnicity (Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>). The Committee noted that the proportion of Pacific women diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage is even higher, at 10.2%. The Committee noted, however, that the referenced Beast Cancer Foundation report did not have complete national data for the time period reported, thus the true epidemiology of advanced breast cancer is New Zealand may be slightly different to what is reported. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the ten-year survival for breast cancer overall\u00a0was 86%; 92% for those with ER+/HER2-negative disease, and 79% for TNBC (Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>).

The Committee also noted that breast-cancer specific survival (ie only including those who died of breast cancer) was 84% at 10 years for w\u0101hine M\u0101ori, compared to 87% for those of European ethnicity (Te R\u0113hita Mate \u016ataetae - Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>). </p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the application from Breast\u00a0Cancer\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0Coalition (BCAC) for the use of eribulin for the treatment of individuals with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (HER-2 negative and triple negative breast cancers) who have progressed after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease. The Committee noted that eribulin has not been previously considered for any indication. </p><h2><strong>Health need </strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advanced breast cancer includes both locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer and is classified as being Stage IV. It is the most advanced stage of breast cancer and that breast cancers can contain any of the three major receptors often found in breast cancer: oestrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor. The Committee noted that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells do not present with any of the three receptors. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that according to a <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/3120/1/bcfnz-abc-report-2018-reprint-10.2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018 report by Breast Cancer Foundation NZ</a>, approximately 350 New Zealanders are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer per year. The Committee noted that it is unclear if this also includes those who progress to an advanced stage of disease following an earlier diagnosis. The Committee noted that approximately 84% of breast cancers are HER2-negative, equating to 294 of the advanced breast cancers diagnosed annually. The Committee noted that men can also develop breast cancer but considered that the numbers were uncertain. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that approximately 5.8% of w\u0101hine M\u0101ori living with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage, compared to 4.7% of those of European ethnicity (Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>). The Committee noted that the proportion of Pacific women diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage is even higher, at 10.2%. The Committee noted, however, that the referenced Beast Cancer Foundation report did not have complete national data for the time period reported, thus the true epidemiology of advanced breast cancer is New Zealand may be slightly different to what is reported. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the ten-year survival for breast cancer overall\u00a0was 86%; 92% for those with ER+/HER2-negative disease, and 79% for TNBC (Breast Cancer Foundation National Register <a href=\"https://breastcancerregister.org.nz/images/assets/4744/1/breast%20cancer%20foundation%20national%20register%20report%202022%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2003-2020 report</a>). The Committee noted that the median survival after a diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer in New Zealand is 16 months. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that individuals with ER+/HER2-negative stage IV breast cancer are typically treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, followed by fulvestrant upon progression of disease, with further lines of chemotherapy if prior treatments have failed, or if the disease progresses further.\u00a0The Committee noted that for individuals with TNBC, there are fewer treatment options, limited to chemotherapy, anthracycline or taxane therapy. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the recommended dose of eribulin (as the ready to use solution) is 1.4 mg/m2 which should be administered intravenously over two to five minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. The Committee also noted that eribulin may also be administered by intravenous bolus over two to five minutes via a side port of a freely flowing IV infusion.</p><h2><strong>Health benefit</strong></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that eribulin mesilate is a halichondrin B-based, microtubule dynamics inhibitor which exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockage as well as effecting tumour vasculature remodelling. The Committee noted that eribulin had not yet been granted New Zealand regulatory approval at the time of the meeting, but that an application had been made to Medsafe. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that individuals for whom eribulin is recommended for the treatment of their locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and who have progressed after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease, should have had an anthracycline and a taxane included in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting unless these were contraindicated. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following clinical evidence for the use of eribulin in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.11.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21376385/\" target=\"_blank\">Cortes et al.

The Committee noted that at this meeting it recommended that this application be declined, noting at the time:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the significant health need of people with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, particularly for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples;</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>that the evidence was conflicting and of low quality and that the results were not generalisable to the New Zealand population demographic</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the less-favourable adverse event profile for eribulin</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>the minimal evidence of benefit from eribulin for the requested population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted its previous commentary regarding the involvement of the sponsor in many aspects of the clinical trial evidence.\u00a0</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted its previous commentary about the generalisability of the evidence to the New Zealand population, primarily M\u0101ori or Pacific people with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The Committee acknowledged that a lack of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity-specific efficacy data is not uncommon for globally run clinical trials. The Committee however considered that the impact of this may be greater in this instance, as many of the relevant eribulin studies were undertaken in Japan. The Committee noted that this is a particularly homogeneous population, and that this presented greater uncertainty in its generalisability to the New Zealand population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee acknowledged the role of patient support and advocacy groups, and considered there to be great value from BCAC engaging in Pharmac processes.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><br></p><p><em style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Health need</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee reiterated the unmet health need of people with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, particularly for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples.

The Committee noted that it had considered the key evidence (EMBRACE trial) for benefit of eribulin in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer was of medium strength and quality (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30928806/\" target=\"_blank\">Yuan et al. Eur J Cancer. 2019;112:57-65</a>).

The Committee noted that the consideration had been based on the Committee\u2019s assessment of what was a wide base of evidence and had included its critical appraisal of the key pivotal clinical trials supporting the use of eribulin. The Committee noted that there was confounding in many of the studies from including patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, that there was limited evidence of improvements in outcomes, concerns regarding the safety profile of eribulin compared to other treatments for the TNBC indication, and that many of the trials appeared imbalanced by the baseline disease burden being greater in the comparator arms. The Committee noted that the evidence supporting its use in TNBC breast cancer came primarily from a subgroup of the intent-to-treat population of studies 301 and 305, supported by what were post-hoc analyses, and therefore this evidence needed to be interpreted with considerable caution.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the additional studies provided by BCAC and the supplier to support the use of eribulin in people with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056400/\" target=\"_blank\">Maeda S, et al.

The Committee acknowledged that a lack of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity-specific efficacy data is not uncommon for globally run clinical trials.

The Committee noted that the consideration had been based on the Committee\u2019s assessment of what was a wide base of evidence and had included its critical appraisal of the key pivotal clinical trials supporting the use of eribulin. The Committee noted that there was confounding in many of the studies from including patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, that there was limited evidence of improvements in outcomes, concerns regarding the safety profile of eribulin compared to other treatments for the TNBC indication, and that many of the trials appeared imbalanced by the baseline disease burden being greater in the comparator arms. The Committee noted that the evidence supporting its use in TNBC breast cancer came primarily from a subgroup of the intent-to-treat population of studies 301 and 305, supported by what were post-hoc analyses, and therefore this evidence needed to be interpreted with considerable caution.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the additional studies provided by BCAC and the supplier to support the use of eribulin in people with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056400/\" target=\"_blank\">Maeda S, et al.

The Committee acknowledged that a lack of M\u0101ori or Pacific ethnicity-specific efficacy data is not uncommon for globally run clinical trials.

The Committee noted that the consideration had been based on the Committee\u2019s assessment of what was a wide base of evidence and had included its critical appraisal of the key pivotal clinical trials supporting the use of eribulin. The Committee noted that there was confounding in many of the studies from including patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, that there was limited evidence of improvements in outcomes, concerns regarding the safety profile of eribulin compared to other treatments for the TNBC indication, and that many of the trials appeared imbalanced by the baseline disease burden being greater in the comparator arms. The Committee noted that the evidence supporting its use in TNBC breast cancer came primarily from a subgroup of the intent-to-treat population of studies 301 and 305, supported by what were post-hoc analyses, and therefore this evidence needed to be interpreted with considerable caution.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the additional studies provided by BCAC and the supplier to support the use of eribulin in people with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056400/\" target=\"_blank\">Maeda S, et al.
