The Committee noted that individuals with SBS-IF are reliant on ongoing parenteral support for survival with the requirement to be hooked-up via intravenous line to an infusion pump for an average of 12 hour per day, five times per week. The Committee noted that this has substantial quality of life impacts for individuals with SBS-IF in relation to their sleep, and ability to work and socialise.\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, with current standard of care, only half of individuals on parenteral support survive more than ten years due to the development of life-threatening complications (such as sepsis, blood clots, or liver damage) associated with parenteral support and intravenous feeding.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau and caregivers of individuals with SBS-IF also face substantial quality of life impacts as they need to devote physical, emotional and financial resources to caring for their family member with SBS-IF. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau often have to take time off work or other obligations in order to offer care, assist with preparing and administering intravenous feeding, assisting with physical hygiene, and transport to medical appointments. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau of individuals receiving parenteral support report a lack of social activities, disrupted familial and other relationships, lost friendships, withdrawal of external support, and repeated episodes of depression.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an abstract of a study detailing information on children with intestinal failure using data from the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure Service registry (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2019/07002/P3A_01__The_first_three_years_of_the_New_Zealand.61.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Andrews et al. Transplantation.2019;103(7S2):S42</a>). The Committee noted that the abstract reported that 56% of the group reported were male, 44% had been born preterm, and that Pacific and M\u0101ori children were marginally overrepresented accounting for 13% and 28% of the population cohort respectively, compared to 9% and 26% of the New Zealand paediatric population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that people with IF living in areas of high New Zealand socioeconomic deprivation were overrepresented, with 36% in the highest deprivation quintile and 9% in the least deprived quintile, compared to 24% and 19% respectively of the New Zealand paediatric population. The Committee noted that, in the abstract, SBS caused IF in 18% of cases, although for preterm neonates the prevalence of short bowel syndrome was higher (36%).</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following recommendations from other jurisdictions regarding the use of teduglutide in the treatment of SBS-IF:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.10.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The PBAC (Australia) recommended that teduglutide be funded for adults with SBS-IF in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2019-03/files/teduglutide-psd-march-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2019</a>, noting the high clinical need and the possibility that teduglutide may reduce the burden associated with parenteral support.

NICE noted that clinical trial evidence showed that teduglutide reduces the number of days a week people with SBS require parenteral support compared with placebo, however, how much it reduces this is uncertain because the trial design may not reflect clinical practice.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the primary evidence available at the time of the November 2018 assessment of teduglutide for SBS-IF came from the STEPS randomised phase III clinical trial of teduglutide versus placebo in adults with SBS-IF with dependency on parenteral support at least three times per week (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22982184/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeppesen et al. Gastroenterology. 2012;143:1473-1481</a>). The Committee noted that, in this trial, teduglutide offered at 33% improvement in response (measured as \u226520% reduction in parenteral support requirement) over placebo. The Committee noted that 54% of participants in the teduglutide treatment arm had a \u22651 day reduction in weekly parenteral nutrition requirements versus 23% with placebo. The Committee noted that there was minimal difference in treatment emergent adverse events between treatment arms, and that the most common treatment emergent adverse events in the teduglutide treatment arm were abdominal pain, nausea, gastrointestinal stoma complications, and abdominal distension.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in the STEPS quality of life analysis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23587733/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeppesen et al. Clin Nutr. 2013;32:713-21</a>), parenteral support reduction was associated with statistically significant quality of life improvements compared to baseline, which were not seen in those treated with placebo. However, the Committee noted additional cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (listed below) that indicated no impact of teduglutide on quality of life and so it was unclear from the published evidence if there was a meaningful quality of life improvement, particularly for a one-day reduced requirement for parenteral support. The Committee considered that one day less of parenteral support would not reduce the risks associated with intravenous feeding.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the STEPS-2 2-year open-label extension of the STEPS trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844839/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwartz et al.

The Committee noted that overall, teduglutide reduced the number of days of parenteral nutrition (and sometimes led to complete discontinuation of parenteral nutrition), and that \u226520% reduction in parenteral nutrition varied from 60-100% in the studies presented. The Committee also noted that abdominal pain, pyrexia and nausea were the most common adverse events relating to teduglutide, that stoma enlargement was often reported, that longer exposure on teduglutide resulted in a higher proportion of participants meeting study endpoints over 6 to 12 months of 40% to 70%, and that colorectal cancer was not increased with use of teduglutide but that the incidence of colon polyps increased.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that post hoc analysis of the STEPS and STEPS-2 trials by Chen et al. reported that having a stoma was a predictor of positive response, and that predictors of negative response were vascular disease, ileocecal valve presence, and being of female gender. The Committee also noted that those with inflammatory bowel disease, stoma, and without colon in continuity had a shorter time to response. The Committee considered that a reduction in parenteral nutrition has downstream intestinotrophic benefits and may reduce the risk of sepsis.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the strength and quality of evidence for the use of teduglutide in the treatment of SBS-IF was moderate.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that individuals with SBS-IF are unlikely to have concerns regarding daily subcutaneous injection with teduglutide or frequent monitoring visits as these individuals are actively involved in their own treatment, well acquainted with the health system, and can often administer their own parenteral support from home.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, although there is evidence that teduglutide may reduce the need for parenteral support, it would likely not eliminate the need for parenteral support in most patients. The Committee noted that the cost of teduglutide would be in addition to the cost of current treatment for the majority of individuals with SBS-IF. The Committee also considered that improvements in quality of life associated with teduglutide in the requested population are likely to be gained but noted that there is limited evidence of this in the currently published literature.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that one 5mg vial of teduglutide is adequate for an individual weighing up to 100kg and that the dose should be determined based on the weight of the individual receiving treatment. The Committee noted that the vial is for single use in one individual only and that any residue should be discarded, which would lead to substantial wastage of product, particularly in the paediatric setting.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of individuals who would access teduglutide under the suggested criteria is unknown but considered, based on the number of people accessing parenteral nutrition in New Zealand, that numbers are likely to be higher than proposed by the supplier in their 2018 submission. The Committee also considered that it was not clear if SBS-IF met the principles for a rare disorder.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Funding criteria</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment of children with SBS-IF should be considered differently from the treatment of adults, and children are still growing and accommodating and do not have a static condition. The Committee considered that neonatal cases of SBS-IF where there was more than 25cm of small bowel remaining may be able to eventually achieve autonomy from parenteral feeding. The Committee considered that this scenario would be where treatment with teduglutide would have the most benefit in the reduction of long-term morbidities in these individuals. The Committee considered that those most at risk of intestinal failure and life-threatening complications in the paediatric population were pre-term babies, and those with growth restriction or complicated gastroschisis, all of which are more common in those with lower social determinants of health. The Committee noted again that there is some evidence for enteral autonomy in this population when treated with teduglutide, but that the evidence is not strong.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The <span style=\"color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for teduglutide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for SBS-IF. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Committee noted an abstract of a study detailing information on children with intestinal failure using data from the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure Service registry (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2019/07002/P3A_01__The_first_three_years_of_the_New_Zealand.61.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Andrews et al. Transplantation.2019;103(7S2):S42</a>).\u00a0The Committee noted that the abstract reported that M\u0101ori children were marginally overrepresented accounting for 28% of the population cohort respectively, compared to 26% of the New Zealand paediatric population.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that it reviewed an application for teduglutide for SBS-IF in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorders-subcommittee-minutes-2018-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2018</a> where it recommended that the application be declined, based on the modest evidence of short-term benefit provided by treatment, lack of long-term data, and safety concerns. The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the record from the Subcommittee meeting in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2019</a>, where it accepted the Subcommittee recommendation that the application be declined.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in 2021, additional correspondence was received from the supplier providing further information for consideration and outlining the need for teduglutide for individuals with SBS-IF. The Committee noted that additional applications had also been received from Te Whatu Ora (endorsed by the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure &amp; Rehabilitation Service) regarding evidence for the use of teduglutide in children.

The Committee noted that individuals with SBS-IF are reliant on ongoing parenteral support for survival with the requirement to be hooked-up via intravenous line to an infusion pump for an average of 12 hour per day, five times per week. The Committee noted that this has substantial quality of life impacts for individuals with SBS-IF in relation to their sleep, and ability to work and socialise.\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, with current standard of care, only half of individuals on parenteral support survive more than ten years due to the development of life-threatening complications (such as sepsis, blood clots, or liver damage) associated with parenteral support and intravenous feeding.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau and caregivers of individuals with SBS-IF also face substantial quality of life impacts as they need to devote physical, emotional and financial resources to caring for their family member with SBS-IF. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau often have to take time off work or other obligations in order to offer care, assist with preparing and administering intravenous feeding, assisting with physical hygiene, and transport to medical appointments. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau of individuals receiving parenteral support report a lack of social activities, disrupted familial and other relationships, lost friendships, withdrawal of external support, and repeated episodes of depression.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an abstract of a study detailing information on children with intestinal failure using data from the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure Service registry (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2019/07002/P3A_01__The_first_three_years_of_the_New_Zealand.61.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Andrews et al. Transplantation.2019;103(7S2):S42</a>). The Committee noted that the abstract reported that 56% of the group reported were male, 44% had been born preterm, and that Pacific and M\u0101ori children were marginally overrepresented accounting for 13% and 28% of the population cohort respectively, compared to 9% and 26% of the New Zealand paediatric population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that people with IF living in areas of high New Zealand socioeconomic deprivation were overrepresented, with 36% in the highest deprivation quintile and 9% in the least deprived quintile, compared to 24% and 19% respectively of the New Zealand paediatric population. The Committee noted that, in the abstract, SBS caused IF in 18% of cases, although for preterm neonates the prevalence of short bowel syndrome was higher (36%).</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following recommendations from other jurisdictions regarding the use of teduglutide in the treatment of SBS-IF:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.10.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The PBAC (Australia) recommended that teduglutide be funded for adults with SBS-IF in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2019-03/files/teduglutide-psd-march-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">2019</a>, noting the high clinical need and the possibility that teduglutide may reduce the burden associated with parenteral support.

Gastroenterology. 2012;143:1473-1481</a>). The Committee noted that, in this trial, teduglutide offered at 33% improvement in response (measured as \u226520% reduction in parenteral support requirement) over placebo. The Committee noted that 54% of participants in the teduglutide treatment arm had a \u22651 day reduction in weekly parenteral nutrition requirements versus 23% with placebo. The Committee noted that there was minimal difference in treatment emergent adverse events between treatment arms, and that the most common treatment emergent adverse events in the teduglutide treatment arm were abdominal pain, nausea, gastrointestinal stoma complications, and abdominal distension.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in the STEPS quality of life analysis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23587733/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeppesen et al. Clin Nutr. 2013;32:713-21</a>), parenteral support reduction was associated with statistically significant quality of life improvements compared to baseline, which were not seen in those treated with placebo. However, the Committee noted additional cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (listed below) that indicated no impact of teduglutide on quality of life and so it was unclear from the published evidence if there was a meaningful quality of life improvement, particularly for a one-day reduced requirement for parenteral support. The Committee considered that one day less of parenteral support would not reduce the risks associated with intravenous feeding.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted the STEPS-2 2-year open-label extension of the STEPS trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844839/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwartz et al.

Front Nutr. 2022;9:866518</a></p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the studies ranged widely in quality and numbers of participants and considered that the data was highly heterogenous. The Committee noted that overall, teduglutide reduced the number of days of parenteral nutrition (and sometimes led to complete discontinuation of parenteral nutrition), and that \u226520% reduction in parenteral nutrition varied from 60-100% in the studies presented. The Committee also noted that abdominal pain, pyrexia and nausea were the most common adverse events relating to teduglutide, that stoma enlargement was often reported, that longer exposure on teduglutide resulted in a higher proportion of participants meeting study endpoints over 6 to 12 months of 40% to 70%, and that colorectal cancer was not increased with use of teduglutide but that the incidence of colon polyps increased.</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that post hoc analysis of the STEPS and STEPS-2 trials by Chen et al. reported that having a stoma was a predictor of positive response, and that predictors of negative response were vascular disease, ileocecal valve presence, and being of female gender. The Committee also noted that those with inflammatory bowel disease, stoma, and without colon in continuity had a shorter time to response. The Committee considered that a reduction in parenteral nutrition has downstream intestinotrophic benefits and may reduce the risk of sepsis.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the strength and quality of evidence for the use of teduglutide in the treatment of SBS-IF was moderate.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that individuals with SBS-IF are unlikely to have concerns regarding daily subcutaneous injection with teduglutide or frequent monitoring visits as these individuals are actively involved in their own treatment, well acquainted with the health system, and can often administer their own parenteral support from home.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, although there is evidence that teduglutide may reduce the need for parenteral support, it would likely not eliminate the need for parenteral support in most patients. The Committee noted that the cost of teduglutide would be in addition to the cost of current treatment for the majority of individuals with SBS-IF. The Committee also considered that improvements in quality of life associated with teduglutide in the requested population are likely to be gained but noted that there is limited evidence of this in the currently published literature.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that one 5mg vial of teduglutide is adequate for an individual weighing up to 100kg and that the dose should be determined based on the weight of the individual receiving treatment. The Committee noted that the vial is for single use in one individual only and that any residue should be discarded, which would lead to substantial wastage of product, particularly in the paediatric setting.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of individuals who would access teduglutide under the suggested criteria is unknown but considered, based on the number of people accessing parenteral nutrition in New Zealand, that numbers are likely to be higher than proposed by the supplier in their 2018 submission. The Committee also considered that it was not clear if SBS-IF met the principles for a rare disorder.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Funding criteria</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment of children with SBS-IF should be considered differently from the treatment of adults, and children are still growing and accommodating and do not have a static condition. The Committee considered that neonatal cases of SBS-IF where there was more than 25cm of small bowel remaining may be able to eventually achieve autonomy from parenteral feeding. The Committee considered that this scenario would be where treatment with teduglutide would have the most benefit in the reduction of long-term morbidities in these individuals. The Committee considered that those most at risk of intestinal failure and life-threatening complications in the paediatric population were pre-term babies, and those with growth restriction or complicated gastroschisis, all of which are more common in those with lower social determinants of health. The Committee noted again that there is some evidence for enteral autonomy in this population when treated with teduglutide, but that the evidence is not strong.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The <span style=\"color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for teduglutide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for SBS-IF. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">\ufeff</span><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000M7Et8&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EMOZ0000005PnN\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",

The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the record from the Subcommittee meeting in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2019</a>, where it accepted the Subcommittee recommendation that the application be declined.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in 2021, additional correspondence was received from the supplier providing further information for consideration and outlining the need for teduglutide for individuals with SBS-IF. The Committee noted that additional applications had also been received from Te Whatu Ora (endorsed by the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure &amp; Rehabilitation Service) regarding evidence for the use of teduglutide in children.

The Committee noted that individuals with SBS-IF are reliant on ongoing parenteral support for survival with the requirement to be hooked-up via intravenous line to an infusion pump for an average of 12 hour per day, five times per week. The Committee noted that this has substantial quality of life impacts for individuals with SBS-IF in relation to their sleep, and ability to work and socialise.\u00a0</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, with current standard of care, only half of individuals on parenteral support survive more than ten years due to the development of life-threatening complications (such as sepsis, blood clots, or liver damage) associated with parenteral support and intravenous feeding.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau and caregivers of individuals with SBS-IF also face substantial quality of life impacts as they need to devote physical, emotional and financial resources to caring for their family member with SBS-IF. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau often have to take time off work or other obligations in order to offer care, assist with preparing and administering intravenous feeding, assisting with physical hygiene, and transport to medical appointments. The Committee noted that wh\u0101nau of individuals receiving parenteral support report a lack of social activities, disrupted familial and other relationships, lost friendships, withdrawal of external support, and repeated episodes of depression.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an abstract of a study detailing information on children with intestinal failure using data from the New Zealand National Intestinal Failure Service registry (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2019/07002/P3A_01__The_first_three_years_of_the_New_Zealand.61.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Andrews et al. Transplantation.2019;103(7S2):S42</a>). The Committee noted that the abstract reported that 56% of the group reported were male, 44% had been born preterm, and that Pacific and M\u0101ori children were marginally overrepresented accounting for 13% and 28% of the population cohort respectively, compared to 9% and 26% of the New Zealand paediatric population.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.9.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee also noted that people with IF living in areas of high New Zealand socioeconomic deprivation were overrepresented, with 36% in the highest deprivation quintile and 9% in the least deprived quintile, compared to 24% and 19% respectively of the New Zealand paediatric population.

The Committee considered that a reduction in parenteral nutrition has downstream intestinotrophic benefits and may reduce the risk of sepsis.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the strength and quality of evidence for the use of teduglutide in the treatment of SBS-IF was moderate.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that individuals with SBS-IF are unlikely to have concerns regarding daily subcutaneous injection with teduglutide or frequent monitoring visits as these individuals are actively involved in their own treatment, well acquainted with the health system, and can often administer their own parenteral support from home.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, although there is evidence that teduglutide may reduce the need for parenteral support, it would likely not eliminate the need for parenteral support in most patients. The Committee noted that the cost of teduglutide would be in addition to the cost of current treatment for the majority of individuals with SBS-IF. The Committee also considered that improvements in quality of life associated with teduglutide in the requested population are likely to be gained but noted that there is limited evidence of this in the currently published literature.</p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that one 5mg vial of teduglutide is adequate for an individual weighing up to 100kg and that the dose should be determined based on the weight of the individual receiving treatment. The Committee noted that the vial is for single use in one individual only and that any residue should be discarded, which would lead to substantial wastage of product, particularly in the paediatric setting.</p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of individuals who would access teduglutide under the suggested criteria is unknown but considered, based on the number of people accessing parenteral nutrition in New Zealand, that numbers are likely to be higher than proposed by the supplier in their 2018 submission. The Committee also considered that it was not clear if SBS-IF met the principles for a rare disorder.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Funding criteria</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the treatment of children with SBS-IF should be considered differently from the treatment of adults, and children are still growing and accommodating and do not have a static condition. The Committee considered that neonatal cases of SBS-IF where there was more than 25cm of small bowel remaining may be able to eventually achieve autonomy from parenteral feeding. The Committee considered that this scenario would be where treatment with teduglutide would have the most benefit in the reduction of long-term morbidities in these individuals. The Committee considered that those most at risk of intestinal failure and life-threatening complications in the paediatric population were pre-term babies, and those with growth restriction or complicated gastroschisis, all of which are more common in those with lower social determinants of health. The Committee noted again that there is some evidence for enteral autonomy in this population when treated with teduglutide, but that the evidence is not strong.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The <span style=\"color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for teduglutide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for SBS-IF. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">\ufeff</span><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000M7Et8&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EMOZ0000005PnN\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
