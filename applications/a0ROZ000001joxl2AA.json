The Committee noted that aHUS is a rare disease and there is no information currently avaliable that demonstrates that M\u0101ori individuals are disproportionately impacted by aHUS.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health need</em></h3><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that aHUS is characterised by progressive episodes of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The Committee noted that 20% of individuals with aHUS can also experience extra-renal complications involving the central nervous, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and skeletal systems.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the complement pathway forms part of the innate immune system, and that the pathway leads to the formation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex, which inserts pores into the target cell membrane leading to osmotic lysis and cell death. The Committee noted that the alternative complement pathway is self-amplifying, with constant low levels of activation requiring continuous regulation.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that individuals with aHUS, can have inherited or sporadically acquired genetic mutations in the regulatory inhibitors of the complement system. The Committee noted that approximately 65% of individuals with aHUS result from genetic mutations in the complement regulatory genes...\u00a0The Committee noted the genetic mutations that have been detected in individuals and are associated with aHUS including: CFH, CFI, C3, MCP, THBD, CFB, DAF, CFHR1/3, CD59, CR and anti-CFH antibodies. The Committee noted that sporadic manifestations of aHUS have resulted following pregnancy, gastro-intestinal or pulmonary (bacterial/ viral) infection, autoimmune conditions, organ transplants and drug treatments. The Committee noted that the underlying genetic mutation remains unidentified in approximately 30% of individuals with aHUS.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that aHUS is a rare and life-threatening disease. The Committee noted that clinical presentation of aHUS is heterogenous, and the symptoms of aHUS can arise progressively over time, or suddenly, with these individuals being critically ill and requiring immediate medical attention. The Committee noted that aHUS can occur at any age and irrespective of the mutation type, approximately 67% of individuals with aHUS are affected during childhood. The Committee noted that aHUS is difficult to diagnose, and normally occurred as a process of elimination of other indications.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mutation type has prognostic implications. The Committee noted that there is a 50% likelihood overall that an individual will experience end-stage renal disease, a 30% likelihood that the individual will experience neurologic symptoms and 25% likelihood that the individual will die during the acute phase of aHUS. The Committee noted that individuals with CFH, CFB, C3, CFI, and anti-CFH antibodies mutations being associated with the highest risk of end-stage renal disease and or death at the first presentation of the disease or within one year of symptom presentation.\u00a0Particular mutations such as CFH, CFB and C3 have the highest risk of progression to end stage kidney disease and recurrence following kidney transplantation. The Committee noted that individuals with the MCP mutation are likely to have a better prognosis as the effect on renal outcomes can be milder, however recurrent episodes of MCP-mediated aHUS are\u00a0more frequent in comparison to other aHUS-associated genetic mutations (about 10-15% of individuals with aHUS).</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there is an estimated prevalence of 2.40 per million adults with aHUS in Australia (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4085397/#:~:text=Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20(CKD)%20is,disease%20%5B2%2D4%5D.\" target=\"_blank\">Mallett et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2014; 9: 98</a>). The Committee noted an epidemiology systematic literature review (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32210633/\" target=\"_blank\">Yan et al. Clin Epidemiol. 2020; 12: 295-305</a>) which indicated that the global incidence rate for aHUS in individuals under the age of twenty years old to range between 0.23 and 0.75 per million annually and the global incidence rate for aHUS in all-ages was between 0.23 to 1.9 per million population. According to patient data from clinicians at Starship hospital, the Committee considered that the incidence for paediatric individuals (15 and younger) was 1.2 per million for New Zealand. The Committee noted that aHUS individuals make up about 0.2% of the Australian chronic kidney disease cohort (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4085397/#:~:text=Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20(CKD)%20is,disease%20%5B2%2D4%5D.\" target=\"_blank\">Mallett et al.

The Committee noted that due to the heterogeneity of the disease the response to therapeutic regimens also differs and must be personalised for the individual. The Committee noted that plasma exchange removes the genetically defective complement proteins or associated antibodies and replaces them with normal functioning proteins. The Committee noted that the response to plasma therapy varies between individuals and some patients will develop resistance to plasma exchange or infusions over the course of their experience of the disease. Plasma exchange also requires dedicated vascular access which over time will become depleted due to complications of line sepsis and vascular stenosis and thrombosis.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that when the disease is active and unmanaged, the individuals become progressively more ill and the risk of permanent kidney damage becomes high, leading to a requirement for renal replacement therapies, which require a number of hospital stays which negatively impacts the individual\u2019s and wh\u0101nau quality of life. The Committee noted that combined liver-kidney transplant is another treatment option for advanced disease but is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and internationally eculizumab is the preferred treatment for individuals with aHUS.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there is a severe unmet health need for individuals with aHUS due to the lack of available therapies.

The Committee noted that plasma exchange removes the genetically defective complement proteins or associated antibodies and replaces them with normal functioning proteins. The Committee noted that the response to plasma therapy varies between individuals and some patients will develop resistance to plasma exchange or infusions over the course of their experience of the disease.

The Committee noted that the response to plasma therapy varies between individuals and some patients will develop resistance to plasma exchange or infusions over the course of their experience of the disease. Plasma exchange also requires dedicated vascular access which over time will become depleted due to complications of line sepsis and vascular stenosis and thrombosis.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that when the disease is active and unmanaged, the individuals become progressively more ill and the risk of permanent kidney damage becomes high, leading to a requirement for renal replacement therapies, which require a number of hospital stays which negatively impacts the individual\u2019s and wh\u0101nau quality of life. The Committee noted that combined liver-kidney transplant is another treatment option for advanced disease but is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and internationally eculizumab is the preferred treatment for individuals with aHUS.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there is a severe unmet health need for individuals with aHUS due to the lack of available therapies. The Committee noted that given the characteristics of aHUS (rarity, chronicity, and childhood onset of aHUS) providing therapeutic options to improve the quality of life for individuals with aHUS is a government health priority.</p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Health benefit</em></h3><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement thereby preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex through the alternative pathway.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that eculizumab treatment can increase the likelihood of the individual contracting meningococcal disease.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following study which included two phase 2 prospective single-arm trials <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23738544/\" target=\"_blank\">(Lengendre et al. N Engl J Med. 2013; 368: 2169-81)</a> as the primary evidence for the efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of individuals with aHUS:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.17.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The first trial involved 17 individuals with aHUS and 12 years or older, weighing at least 40kg with abnormal or low platelet count and renal damage. Eculizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 900 mg per week for 4 weeks, a dose of 1200 mg 1 week later, and a maintenance dose of 1200 mg every 2 weeks for 26 weeks, with a continuation of the trial to 62-64 weeks. Fifty-three percent of the participants with an abnormal platelet count at baseline had a normal platelet count (\u2265150\u00d7109/L) by day 7, and 87% had platelet counts that remained normal at both weeks 26 and 64. Normalisation of platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase levels occur in 88% of participants. 15 of the 17 participants (88%) had thrombotic microangiopathy event\u2013free status through to week 26.13 individuals extended treatment to 64 weeks and 100% had thrombotic microangiopathy event\u2013free status. The mean increase in eGFR from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment was 32 ml/ minute /1.73 m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> (95% CI, 14 to 49; P = 0.001). Dialysis was discontinued in four of five participants (80%) who had required dialysis at the time of initiation of eculizumab, and these participants remained dialysis-free throughout eculizumab treatment. Whilst receiving eculizumab 88% of individuals no longer required plasma exchange or infusion.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.17.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The second trial involved 20 individuals who were 12 years or older, weighing at least 40kg with renal damage and no variation greater than 25% in platelet count. Eculizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 900 mg per week for 4 weeks, a dose of 1200 mg 1 week later, and a maintenance dose of 1200 mg every 2 weeks for 26 weeks, with a continuation of the trial to 62-64 weeks. 16 of 20 participants (80%) experienced complete inhibition of complement- mediated thrombotic microangiopathy indicated by thrombotic microangiopathy event-free status for at least 12 weeks (no decrease in platelet count of &gt;25%, no plasma therapy, no initiation of dialysis)) by week 26; this proportion increased to 85% through the median treatment duration of 62 weeks. Four participants did not meet the end point at 26 weeks because of a transient decrease in the platelet count of more than 25% from baseline, although all four maintained normal platelet counts. The mean increase in eGFR from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment was 6 ml/ minute /1.73 m<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">2</span> (95% CI, 3 to 9; P&lt;0.001). With initiation of eculizumab, plasma exchange or infusion was discontinued in all participants, and no new dialysis was required.

The Committee noted that eculizumab can provide the individual with a high likelihood that they would experience improved renal function and significantly reduce the risk of developing end-stage renal disease, thus avoiding dialysis, renal or liver transplant, and pre-mature death.</p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that New Zealand\u2019s incidence rates are similar to the global incidence rates and that individuals with aHUS in New Zealand are likely to experience significant health benefit if eculizumab were to be funded.</p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that some individuals can experience complete remission of the symptoms of aHUS following eculizumab therapy and these individuals may be able to discontinue eculizumab therapy. However, the Committee considered that the evidence for discontinuing eculizumab to be uncertain and in clinical practice treatment will likely be lifelong, however noted that research into safely discontinuing eculizumab is ongoing.\u00a0The Committee noted the following observational studies regarding the discontinuation, re-initiation, and long-term efficacy of eculizumab:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.21.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30971227/\" target=\"_blank\">Menne et al.

At eculizumab discontinuation, 17 (30%) and 4 individuals (7%) had stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease, respectively. During follow-up, 13 individuals (23%; 6 children and 7 adults) experienced aHUS relapse. In multivariable analysis, female sex, and presence of a rare variant in a complement gene were associated with an increased risk of aHUS relapse, the requirement for dialysis during a previous episode of acute aHUS was not. Of the 13 relapsing individuals, all of whom restarted eculizumab, 11 regained their baseline renal function and 2 had a worsening of their pre-existing chronic kidney disease, including 1 patient who progressed to end-stage renal disease.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.21.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36644349/\" target=\"_blank\">Bouwmeester et al.</a><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36644349/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </a><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36644349/\" target=\"_blank\">Kidney Int Rep.\u00a02022; 8 :91-102</a>: 21 Individuals received a median of 13.6 weeks (range 2.1-43.9) of eculizumab therapy and were monitored for 4 years.
