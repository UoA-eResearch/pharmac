However, the Committee considered that the control arm does not measure benefit of ipilimumab + nivolumab + chemotherapy against nivolumab + chemotherapy, and that the additional benefit of ipilimumab is therefore unclear.

The Committee considered the toxicity of nivolumab + ipilimumab may be higher compared to the other treatments discussed for advanced NSCLC, even with the attenuated schedule.

The Committee considered that if one of these treatments were to be funded for advanced NSCLC, this would result in a significant increment in numbers of people both at implementation and with conditional survival improvements, leading to increased pressure on infusion services. The Committee also considered that infusion times with increasing numbers of agents included in regimens would exacerbate the burden on infusion services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the shelf life of the treatments to be crucial in terms of equity of access. The Committee considered that a minimum of 24 hours (ideally 7 days) stability is required for pressured compounding and day unit infusion services.
