The Subcommittee noted that, while not unanimous, based on the currently available evidence for use of various agents there was majority support for a class effect for monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in treatment for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that while there is variability between trials for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab) in how they stratify by PD-L1 expression, participants are generally grouped based on PD-L1 tumour expression of ≥ 50% (high expression), PD-L1 tumour expression of ≥ 1% (PD-L1 positive), and PD-L1 expression &lt;1% (PD-L1 negative).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although stratification of patients in clinical trials based on PD-L1 expression is relatively consistent across studies, at the current time it is difficult to determine what the downstream immune effects of PD-L1 blockade are and so PD-L1 expression may not be biologically meaningful in defining a patient population for exclusion of benefit of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.15. </span>The Subcommittee considered that published data indicates that a higher expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells or surrounding immune stromal cells correlates to a higher response rate from ICI agents.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that although patients with high PD-L1 expression appear to benefit most, those with lower expression may also benefit, with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that use of different assays, tumour proportion scores, and PD-L1 expression thresholds may lead to problems with reproducibility and standardisation of testing and by extrapolation the benefits observed in trial populations.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that lab-developed tests used in New Zealand may not have the same sensitivity as the tests used in the clinical trials. As a variety of PD-L1 testing platforms are in use in New Zealand, the Subcommittee considered that the true rates of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC for patients in New Zealand may be difficult to estimate.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.19.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the majority of research regarding the use of immunotherapies for lung cancer to date has been conducted in patients who do not express targetable driver mutations (e.g. EGFR-negative, ALK-negative). Therefore, the Subcommittee considered there continued to be a lack of data to support efficacy of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents in patients with known driver mutations, such that inclusion of these populations in any funding criteria for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents could not currently be supported.\xa0</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.20. </span>The Subcommittee considered that similarly patients with uncontrolled brain metastases were not included in trial populations, and that in NSCLC this is considered an unfavourable prognostic factor such that it would be appropriate to exclude these patients from funding of these agents.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.21. </span>The Subcommittee considered it remained appropriate to limit patients to a single line of treatment with anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents which could be administered at any point in the treatment sequence for patients with EGFR wild-type or ALK-negative advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.22. </span>The Subcommittee considered that it would be appropriate to limit the total duration for a course of anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment for advanced NSCLC patients to a maximum of two years of continuous treatment. The Subcommittee considered that while it was expected there may be gaps in treatment due to adverse events, as with many oncology treatments, there was a lack of data to support retreatment following disease progression in anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 pre-treated NSCLC patients, and that treatment should cease at signs of disease progression (whether this occurred during continuous treatment or in a period when ‘off’ treatment).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.23.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, while funding for all advanced NSCLC would be the preferred outcome, if targeting was required for fiscal reasons then use of PD-L1 expression would be reasonable.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.24. </span>The Subcommittee considered there were benefits and shortfalls of a Special Authority criteria mandating PD-L1 testing to determine eligibility for anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents for advanced NSCLC.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.25. </span>The Subcommittee considered that, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand, subject to criteria irrespective of PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level did not determine eligibility for funding) that this would allow clinicians to prescribe anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents according to patient needs and clinical judgement. The Subcommittee considered that in this situation it was likely that the majority of patients would receive treatment as a combination regimen with chemotherapy, and only those considered unfit for chemotherapy would likely receive monotherapy.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, conversely, if anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 agents were to be funded in New Zealand subject to criteria that mandated PD-L1 expression (i.e. where PD-L1 level was a required determinant of eligibility for funding) use of a 50% threshold would likely be appropriate. The Subcommittee considered that this could target funded treatment to those that may benefit most and limit the overall resource impact for DHBs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if first-line treatment were to be funded for all advanced NSCLC patients (rather than only a high PD-L1 expression population), PD-L1 level would likely be used to determine treatment regimen. The Subcommittee considered that any patients whose disease had high PD-L1 expression (50% or greater) would likely receive anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 monotherapy, with patients whose disease had PD-L1 expression less than 50% who are ‘fit’ receiving the combination regimen. The Subcommittee considered that in this scenario patients who are ‘unfit’ to receive chemotherapy and did not have disease with high expression of PD-L1 may not be eligible to receive funded anti PD-1/anti PD-L1 treatment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.28.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that mandating PD-L1 testing would require DHBs to fund and provide tests but may create inequities for patients who are unfit for chemotherapy and may not meet the specified PD-L1 expression threshold.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: black;"">1.29. </span>The Subcommittee considered that if PD-L1 testing was not used to specify eligibility for funding, it was uncertain whether testing would be implemented equitably by DHBs.

The Committee considered that if one of these treatments were to be funded for advanced NSCLC, this would result in a significant increment in numbers of people both at implementation and with conditional survival improvements, leading to increased pressure on infusion services.

The Committee considered that the studies discussed are of good design, good power, and demonstrate OS benefit despite crossover with consistent secondary endpoints. It was also considered that self-reported outcomes of those treated support the evidence and that the chemotherapy backbones included in these trials are relevant to the New Zealand setting.</p><p><br></p><h3><em>Health Need </em></h3><p>1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the health need for this population to be high, in line with its considerations at previous meetings.

The Committee considered that if one of these treatments were to be funded for advanced NSCLC, this would result in a significant increment in numbers of people both at implementation and with conditional survival improvements, leading to increased pressure on infusion services. The Committee also considered that infusion times with increasing numbers of agents included in regimens would exacerbate the burden on infusion services.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the shelf life of the treatments to be crucial in terms of equity of access. The Committee considered that a minimum of 24 hours (ideally 7 days) stability is required for pressured compounding and day unit infusion services. Members however considered that stability data may vary between compounding facilities depending on the availability of stability data. The Committee noted the lack of stability data for tislelizumab and considered this may result in implementation issues.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered it would be preferable for the treatment to have the widest dosing interval as possible, ideally with the option for widening treatment intervals to beyond 3 weeks.
