The Subcommittee noted that in September 2018, CaTSoP considered an application for the use of palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial (first-line) endocrine-based therapy for HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CaTSoP minutes – Sep 2018</a>).

The Subcommittee considered that the population included in PALOMA-3 therefore represented patients receiving late therapy, not just second-line therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the final analysis of PALOMA-3, Cristofanilli et al. 2016 reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 4.6 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.59; P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee considered that the response to treatment was relatively slow to manifest, with a median time to response of 112 days in the palbociclib arm. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that endocrine therapy resistance was assessed by a number of parameters in PALOMA-3, including by tumour PIK3CA mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that at the time of the final analysis (median follow-up 8.9 months) PIK3CA status did not significantly affect treatment response (median PFS PIK3CA positive: 9.5 months palbociclib vs 3.6 months placebo; median PFS PIK3CA negative: 9.9 months palbociclib vs 4.6 months placebo; two-sided Pinteraction=0.83) (Cristofanilli et al.2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that at the time of the prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of PALOMA-3, Turner et al. 2018 reported a median OS of 34.9 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 28.0 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03; P=0.09). The Subcommittee noted that PALOMA3 was not powered to detect an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the subgroup analysis conducted at the time of the prespecified OS analysis as reported by Turner et al. 2018. The Subcommittee considered that the subgroups who appeared to benefit most from treatment with palbociclib included patients with sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, patients who were postmenopausal at study entry, patients aged 65 years or over, and patients with a disease-free interval of more than 24 months. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that assessing OS is difficult in diseases such as HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in early-line settings, due to the long survival time and because patients often receive multiple lines of subsequent therapy. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-3, 4% of patients 14 in the palbociclib arm and 16% of patients in the placebo arm received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in a subsequent line of therapy. The Subcommittee considered that this makes the interpretation of benefit difficult, and that, if anything, may underestimate the magnitude of benefit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was well tolerated in PALOMA-3 (Verma et al. 2016). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with advanced disease inevitably have a shorter progression-free periods in response to each additional line of treatment; and considered that the PFS benefit observed in later line patients in PALOMA-3 reflected this. The Subcommittee noted that in PALOMA-2, which investigated the efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole as a first-line treatment in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer the median PFS was 24.8 months palbociclib vs 14.5 months placebo (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959613"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:1925-1936</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer has received a score of 4 on the European Society for Medical Oncology – Magnitude of Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS; graded from 1 [worst] to 5 [best]). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a significant health need for an additional treatment option for women with previously-treated HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and that PALOMA-3 provides good evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting and that further data would likely show an OS benefit. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other CDK4/6 inhibitors </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is a growing body of data regarding the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first- and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Ribociclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the second interim analysis of the phase 3 MONALEESA-2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of firstline ribociclib plus letrozole compared with placebo plus letrozole in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718092"" target=""_blank"">Hortobagyi et al. Ann Oncol. 2018;29:1541-7</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the median PFS was 25.3 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 16.0 month in the placebo/letrozole arm (HR 0.568; 95% CI 0.457 to 0.704; log-rank P = 9.63 x 10-8 ). The Subcommittee considered that this result was comparable to that observed in PALOMA-2. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with placebo and endocrine therapy in 672 premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902"" target=""_blank"">Tripathy et al. Lancet Oncol. 2018;19:904-15</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients could receive either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor as endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 19.2 months, that the median PFS was 23.8 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 13.0 months in the placebo/endocrine therapy arm (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.69; P&lt;0.0001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the initial results of the phase 3 MONALEESA-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of ribociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in 484 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer who were treatment naïve or had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860922"" target=""_blank"">Slamon et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:2465- 72</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at a median follow-up of 20.4 months, that the median PFS was 20.5 months in the ribociclib arm compared with 12.8 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm (HR 0.593; 95% CI 0.480 to 0.732; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS in patients who were treatment-naïve in this trial was not reached in the ribociclib arm compared with 18.3 months in the placebo/fulvestrant arm. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Abemaciclib </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a planned interim analysis of the phase 3 MONARCH-3 trial, which investigated the efficacy of abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared with placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28968163"" target=""_blank"">Goetz et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:3638-3646</a>). The Subcommittee noted that after a median follow up of 17.8 months, the median PFS was not reached in the abemaciclib arm compared with 14.7 months in the placebo/aromatase inhibitor arm (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.72; P=0.000021). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase 3 MONARCH 2 trial, which investigated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone in 669 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed while receiving endocrine therapy (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580882"" target=""_blank"">Sledge et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:2875-2884</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS was 16.4 months in the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm compared with 9.3 months in the fulvestrant monotherapy arm (HR 0.553; 95% CI 0.449 to 0.681; P&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the single-arm, phase 2 MONARCH-1 trial, which investigated the activity and safety of abemaciclib monotherapy in 132 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had one or two chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533223"" target=""_blank"">Dickler et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2017;23:5218- 5224</a>). The Subcommittee noted that at the 12-month final analysis, the objective response rate was 19.7% (95% CI 13.3 to 27.5), the clinical benefit rate was 42.4%, the median PFS was 6.0 months, and the median OS was 17.7 months. </p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General Comments </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, although there are no head to head trials, the body of data available to date regarding the efficacy and safety of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the first-line and second-line treatment of HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer suggests that there is likely to be a class effect with these agents, and that they can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic benefit in these settings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that additional data would be helpful to further clarify the role of the endocrine partner in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. However, from currently available data the choice of endocrine partner appears not to have a significant impact on the efficacy of combination treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors; and that tamoxifen, non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant could potentially be used interchangeably in this setting. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is currently no evidence available regarding whether it is better to use a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the first- or second-line for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advance breast cancer. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for use in the first-line is more mature at this time, but that the health need for patients who have received prior endocrine therapy for advance disease is higher than for treatment-naïve patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the group of patients who responded well to first-line endocrine therapy (hormone sensitive patients) were the group most likely to respond well to second-line CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy.\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Subcommittee noted that 3,300 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New Zealand and that approximately 20% of patients will develop metastatic disease at some point.

The Committee considered that a composite analysis of PFS,\xa0OS, safety, and QoL data would strengthen the evidence base.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is good quality evidence that palbociclib in\xa0combination with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment provides a modest improvement\xa0in PFS with maintenance of QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was uncertain whether the use of a CDK4/6 in a first or second-line setting would provide greater overall benefit for patients, as there was a\xa0lack of evidence to inform whether these agents altered tumour biology and/or the\xa0efficacy of subsequent treatments. The Committee considered it was likely that the use\xa0of a CDK4/6 inhibitor would alter prescriber behaviour for later line treatments.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that patients who have already progressed following one line\xa0of endocrine therapy have a higher health need than those who are treatment naïve due\xa0to a lack of alternative treatment options.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Special Authority criteria previously recommended\xa0by CaTSoP for the first- and second-line use of CDK4/6 inhibitors are appropriate.\xa0</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000Arg6QAC'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Discussion': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Oct 2019', 'fs': 'Oct 2019', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Clinical advice required', 'fs': 'Clinical advice required', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000R5X7D2AV'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000R5X7D2AV', 'Event_Date__c': '2019-10-01', 'Event_Description__c': 'Clinical advice required', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Oct 2019', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000CmKsQAK'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Discussion': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Oct 2019', 'fs': 'Oct 2019', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'fs': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000R5X7E2AV'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000R5X7E2AV', 'Event_Date__c': '2019-10-01', 'Event_Description__c': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Oct 2019', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000CmLEQA0'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous recommendations that palbociclib as a first-line treatment in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and in combination with fulvestrant as a second line treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer be funded with medium priority subject to the same Special Authority criteria as previously recommended.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the different priority assigned to ribociclib and palbociclib was primarily due to differences in the quality of data currently available for these agents.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that based on currently available data there was a class effect from CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer and <b>recommended</b> funding for patients to receive one line of treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in either a first or second-line setting with high priority.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous recommendation that the following Special Authority criteria be applied to funding of CDK4/6 inhibitors (note combined first-line and second-line criteria are shown below):</p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Special Authority for Subsidy – Retail Pharmacy</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Initial application -</span><b style=""font-size: 9pt;""> </b><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">only from a medical oncologist or </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">any other </span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">medical practitioner on the recommendation of a medical oncologist.
