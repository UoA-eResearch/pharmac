The Committee considered that the higher likelihood of diagnosis in later disease stages may be due to lower rates of opportunistic prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in these populations. The Committee noted that for this reason, Māori are less likely to be treated while their disease is still non-metastatic, and therefore less likely to have nmCRPC.</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered a study undertaken in the Northern region of New Zealand that reported Māori men were less likely to have had opportunistic PSA screening tests undertaken compared to non-Māori men (25.4% vs 46.1% of the total aged-matched region population; P &lt; 0.001). The authors concluded that the difference in the rates of opportunistic screening tests by ethnicity had influenced the incidence and clinical significance of the cancers diagnosed (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33032306/"" target=""_blank"">Matti et al. BJU Int. 2020;128(S3):11-17</a>).

CTAC also considered quality of life was improved with apalutamide maintenance treatment likely due to increased MFS. The PTAC noted apalutamide has a similar mechanism of action to darolutamide, for the same indication.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the population eligible for treatment with darolutamide would be the same as that considered for apalutamide, which represents a subset of those with prostate cancer.</p><h2><strong style=""font-size: 14px;""><em>Health need</em></strong></h2><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the intent of treatment is to defer progression to more symptomatic disease and metastatic disease, in order to maintain quality of life for people with nmCRPC. The Committee considered people with nmCRPC are asymptomatic, with a good quality of life for their age, despite expected side effects from androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) or complications from surgical or radiation treatment (eg urinary incontinence, bowel symptoms or erectile dysfunction). However, they would be likely to develop metastases, particularly if considered high risk by PSA doubling time.\xa0</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most individuals with nmCRPC were prescribed continued ADT with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and monitored through “watch and wait” for disease progression, despite the fact that by definition, those with CR PC were no longer sensitive to ADT.

The Committee considered whether there was any effect of the F876L androgen receptor mutation on the efficacy of treatment in those with nmCRPC. The Committee noted that less than 2% of the population with nmCRPC prior to radiation therapy had the mutation. The Committee considered that there was no clinical trial data on the effect of the mutation before or after treatment, and that this did not impact the benefit for most.</p><h2><strong style=""font-size: 14px;""><em>Health benefit</em></strong></h2><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that darolutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor with a flexible polar-substituted pyrazole structure that binds with high affinity directly to the receptor ligand binding domain. Darolutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation, and AR mediated transcription. Darolutamide treatment decreases prostate tumour cell proliferation leading to potent antitumour activity.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that darolutamide does not cross the blood brain barrier, and has minimal binding to GABA receptors, resulting in less central nervous system side effects, in comparison to apalutamide.

The trial investigated metastasis-free survival (MFS) as the primary endpoint, in 1509 adults with nmCRPC treated with either darolutamide (+ADT) or placebo (+ADT). The Committee noted that this trial reported a MFS of 40.4 months vs 18.4 months in the darolutamide-treated arm compared to placebo-treated (hazard ratio [HR] for metastasis or death in the darolutamide group, 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.50; P&lt;0.001<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">)</span>.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also considered <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2001342"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al.

The Committee noted this study reported that, compared with apalutamide and enzalutamide, darolutamide was associated with statistically signiﬁcantly lower absolute risks for falls, fractures, and rash. In comparison to enzalutamide, darolutamide was also associated with a statistically signiﬁcantly lower absolute risk of mental impairment disorder, fatigue not including asthenia and severe fatigue not including asthenia (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33818140/"" target=""_blank"">Halabi et al.

The Committee considered that the evidence available indicates that darolutamide may be better tolerated in comparison to apalutamide.

The Committee noted the current Pharmac estimate of 90-120 for New Zealand over the first five years and considered that this may be reasonable in current practice, to reflect a prevalent group of people who have been diagnosed with nmCRPC experiencing reasonably good survival, and some people with metastatic disease being diagnosed as non-metastatic using current methods.</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that people with nmCRPC are identified as not having distant metastasis by means of conventional radiological imaging, however, clinical practice is moving rapidly to prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) scanning as the preferred imaging technique to exclude the presence of distant metastases in prostate cancer diagnosis and work-up. The Committee noted that whilst this is not applicable necessarily to all hospitals or locations within New Zealand currently, a study of 200 people with suspected nmCRPC reported approximately 55% had evidence of distant metastatic disease when scanned using PSMA PET <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31511295/"" target=""_blank"">(Fendler et al, Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25:7448-54</a>).

The Committee considered interpretation of these results was limited by it being a supplier-sponsored MAIC study that only indirectly compared treatments, using patient-level data that matched a non-randomised post-hoc defined subset of patients in the SPARTAN trial against patients in the ARAMIS study.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted evidence regarding sequencing of abiraterone followed by enzalutamide. The Committee noted advice from CTAC (<a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2022-04-08-Cancer-Treatments-AC-Record.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2022</a>) that abiraterone should not be used in those people with nmCRPC previously treated with apalutamide. PTAC also noted the use of abiraterone following a second-generation anti-androgen is funded in other countries. The Committee further noted sequencing of abiraterone followed by enzalutamide was reported to have a longer time to PSA progression compared to the reverse sequence, however no difference in OS was noted (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467385/"" target=""_blank"">Cattrini et al, Cancers (Basel). 2021;13:4522</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK571920/"" target=""_blank"">Tran et al, CADTH Health Technology Review; 2021</a>). The Committee considered that in metastatic disease clinical practice in New Zealand is starting to favour docetaxel over abiraterone. The Committee noted that the treatment regime in the ARAMIS trial, and associated apparent increases in OS, is applicable to New Zealand with regards to the subsequent use of docetaxel occurring in 49% of those treated with darolutamide after progression (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1815671"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al. 2019</a>). The Committee noted that approximately 13% of those in the darolutamide treated group in ARAMIS received abiraterone as the first subsequent anticancer therapy (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1815671"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al. 2019</a>).</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, given the similar health benefit of darolutamide compared with other agents in this class, a competitive process that could result in the funding of a single agent from this class would be reasonable.</p><h2><strong style=""font-size: 14px;""><em>Suitability</em></strong></h2><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the oral formulation of darolutamide offered a similar benefit to those with nmCRPC as apalutamide. This would be administered in combination with ADT, which is a subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks.</p><h2><strong style=""font-size: 14px;""><em>Cost and savings</em></strong></h2><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the number of people in this group was previously estimated by CTAC to be approximately 10 patients per year in Auckland, but that patient numbers are uncertain, and Pharmac estimates since have been higher to account for a prevalent surge of patients. The Committee noted the current Pharmac estimate of 90-120 for New Zealand over the first five years and considered that this may be reasonable in current practice, to reflect a prevalent group of people who have been diagnosed with nmCRPC experiencing reasonably good survival, and some people with metastatic disease being diagnosed as non-metastatic using current methods.</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that people with nmCRPC are identified as not having distant metastasis by means of conventional radiological imaging, however, clinical practice is moving rapidly to prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) scanning as the preferred imaging technique to exclude the presence of distant metastases in prostate cancer diagnosis and work-up. The Committee noted that whilst this is not applicable necessarily to all hospitals or locations within New Zealand currently, a study of 200 people with suspected nmCRPC reported approximately 55% had evidence of distant metastatic disease when scanned using PSMA PET <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31511295/"" target=""_blank"">(Fendler et al, Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25:7448-54</a>). The Committee considered it likely that the population with nmCRPC may be reduced in the future, since more people who would currently be considered to have non-metastatic disease would be found to have metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis.</p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the lower rate of discontinuation in clinical studies of those treated with darolutamide vs placebo in comparison to apalutamide vs placebo ((<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905676/"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al, 2020</a>; <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1715546"" target=""_blank"">Smith et al. 2018</a>).

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
