At that time, the Subcommittee recommended mepolizumab be funded for severe allergic eosinophilic asthma, subject to restrictions including a blood eosinophil count of &gt;500 cells/\u00b5L with a high priority. In April 2020, mepolizumab was funded subject to <a href=\"https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2020/11/01/SA1896.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Special Authority criteria</a> (including a blood eosinophil count of greater than 0.5 x 10^9 cells/L [equivalent to &gt;500 cells/\u00b5L]).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in August 2020, GSK, submitted an application to widen access to mepolizumab to patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells/\u00b5L and to remove the requirement for the asthma control test (ACT) from both the initial and renewal access criteria.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the health need, undertreatment, exacerbation rates and hospitalisation rates of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (including the disproportionate burden of this disease on M\u0101ori, Pacific people and other groups experiencing health disparities) has been well described in previous meeting records. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that healthcare costs after an exacerbation in patients with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma have been reported at US$2,040 per exacerbation (<a href=\"https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-017-0409-3\" target=\"_blank\">Suruki et al. 2017</a>).

The Subcommittee noted that the <a href=\"https://ginasthma.org/gina-reports/\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines</a> use a blood eosinophil count threshold of &gt;300 cells/\u00b5L for adding treatment with anti-IL5 at Step 5 (and state that the evidence for this is reasonably weak), whereas the 2020 European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines suggest a threshold of \u2265150 cells/\u00b5L (<a href=\"http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=31558662\" target=\"_blank\">Holguin et al. Eur Respir J. 2020;55:1900588</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the New Zealand Adolescent and Adult Asthma Guidelines (2020) do not refer to eosinophil count when recommending treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma with monoclonal antibodies (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32595223/\" target=\"_blank\">Beasley et al.

The Subcommittee noted that many local laboratories round blood eosinophils to fewer decimal places than occurs in clinical trials, and that the current specification of a blood eosinophil count greater than 0.5 x 10^9 cells/L would, with rounding up to the nearest digit, require a blood eosinophil count of at least 550 cells/\u00b5L. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the evidence provided in support of this application for widened access comes from the DREAM (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(12)60988-X\" target=\"_blank\">Pavord et al. Lancet. 2012;380:651-9</a>), MENSA (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1403290?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Ortega et al.

Lancet Respir Med. 2017;5:390-400</a>). The Subcommittee noted that DREAM included patients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma and subsequently analysed outcomes in patients with blood eosinophil counts of &gt;150 cells/\u00b5L, whereas MENSA and MUSCA was confined to patients with blood eosinophils &gt;150 cells/\u00b5L. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc analyses of DREAM and MENSA, and of MENSA and MUSCA reported a reduced exacerbation frequency and greater treatment effects in patients with greater blood eosinophil counts (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213-2600(16)30031-5\" target=\"_blank\">Ortega et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2016;4:549-56</a>; <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954-6111(19)30320-8\" target=\"_blank\">Albers et al. Respir Med. 2019;159:105806</a>). The Subcommittee considered that these analyses provided evidence of clinical benefit with mepolizumab in patients with a blood eosinophil count &gt;150 cells/\u00b5L, however the Subcommittee noted that the difference in frequency of clinically significant exacerbations in patients with a blood eosinophil count between 150 and &lt;300 cells/\u00b5L in the analysis by <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954-6111(19)30320-8\" target=\"_blank\">Albers et al.</a> did not reach statistical significance (the 95% confidence interval crossing one) (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.45-1.08, <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954-6111(19)30320-8\" target=\"_blank\">Albers et al.</a> Table 2).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted a non-experimental single arm before-and-after cohort study of 368 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (about three-quarters with blood eosinophils \u2265300 cells/\u00b5L) who received at least one dose of mepolizumab, which compared exacerbation rates on the study versus exacerbation rates in the previous year. The Subcommittee noted that clinically significant exacerbations were reduced by 69% and exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and/or ED visits were reduced by 77%, and that the median daily dose of oral corticosteroid was decreased in patients who received oral corticosteroid maintenance treatment (<a href=\"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/56/4/2000151\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison et al. Eur Respir J. 2020;56:2000151</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the patients in this study had comparable baseline disease severity and rates of exacerbations and hospitalisations to the New Zealand population with severe eosinophilic asthma.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that widening access to patients with severe eosinophilic asthma with a blood eosinophil count of greater than 300 cells/\u00b5L would result in approximately double the number of patients eligible for access to mepolizumab in this setting. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s estimates of 917 patients who may be eligible for mepolizumab in year 1 if access were widened (blood eosinophil count of 300 cells/\u00b5L) to 959 eligible patients in year 5, and the assumptions underlying these estimates, were reasonable. The Subcommittee considered that previous estimates of the number of patients with blood eosinophils &gt;500 cells/\u00b5L may have been overestimated; and considered that uptake of mepolizumab since its funding may have been affected by patient transfer from compassionate access schemes, the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020, and the availability of prefilled syringes. The Subcommittee considered that its previous consideration of uptake was still relevant, in that approximately half of all eligible patients would eventually be treated with mepolizumab.</p>",
