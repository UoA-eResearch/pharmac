The Committee noted that mTOR is one of several interconnected cellular pathways and that inhibition of one pathway can cause upregulation of another pathway, therefore the Committee considered that it was important for any treatment which inhibits one or more of these pathways to be supported by sound evidence of efficacy and safety. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that everolimus is not Medsafe-approved for the treatment of aBC, however, it is registered by Medsafe for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours, renal cell carcinoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. The Committee noted that everolimus is administered as a 10 mg oral once daily dose. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant has requested funding for everolimus in combination with exemestane or tamoxifen (both of which are Medsafe-registered and currently funded without restriction) or with fulvestrant (which is not Medsafe-registered and is not currently funded for use in any setting).</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with exemestane </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the key evidence for everolimus in combination with exemestane comes from the randomised, phase III, BOLERO-2 trial which investigated everolimus with exemestane compared to exemestane with placebo in 724 post-menopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous treatment with a nonsteroidal AI (Baselga et al, N Engl J Med. 2012;366:520-9). The Committee noted that 77% of BOLERO-2 patients had bone lesions, 59% of patients had visceral disease, 26% of patients received previous chemotherapy and 20% of patients had received no previous therapy for metastatic breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the interim analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) in BOLERO-2, which report investigator-assessed median PFS of 6.9 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 2.8 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.54, P &lt;0.001) (Baselga et al, N Engl J Med. 2012;366:520-9). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the final analysis of PFS of the BOLERO-2 trial which report median PFS of 7.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 3.2 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.54, P&lt;0.001) (Yardley et al. Adv Ther. 2013;30:870-84). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the subgroup analysis of BOLERO-2 trial patients according to visceral involvement status, which report median PFS of 6.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 2.8 months with placebo and exemestane in patients with visceral involvement compared to PFS of 9.9 months and 4.2 months respectively for patients without visceral involvement (Campone et al. Eur J Cancer. 2013;49:2621-32). The Committee considered that the reduced benefit observed for patients with visceral involvement aligned with the poorer prognosis of this patient group as compared to patients without visceral disease. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the subgroup analysis of elderly BOLERO-2 trial patients which report median PFS of 6.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 1.5 months with placebo and exemestane, in patients ages 70 years and over (Pritchard et al. Clin Breast Cancer. 2013;13:421-32.e8). The Committee considered that the results in this elderly subgroup were consistent with other populations. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the final analysis of overall survival (OS) in BOLERO-2 trial patients, which report median OS of 31.0 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 26.6 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.10, P = 0.1426) (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered that even after a reasonably long follow-up duration and with adequate patient numbers contributing to data beyond 3 years, the study was inadequately powered to confirm the reported OS difference and the reported OS results were not statistically significant. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of post-progression survival (PPS) of 492 BOLERO-2 trial patients who had progressed at the time of the final PFS analysis, which report median PPS of 20.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 19.3 months with placebo and exemestane (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered the PPS results to be similar in each arm and no survival benefit was demonstrated. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that BOLERO-2 trial patients who received placebo with exemestane were more likely to receive chemotherapy (63%) than patients who received everolimus and exemestane (53%) (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered that the results reported by Piccart et al. suggest that whether or not a patient received post-trial chemotherapy had no impact on PPS, however, the time to first chemotherapy was longer with everolimus and exemestane (11.9 months) compared to with placebo and exemestane (6.0 months). The Committee considered that investigators may be able to determine which patients were receiving everolimus by the incidence of stomatitis, and consequently that patients thought to be receiving placebo would receive more aggressive therapy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of an analysis of adverse event (AE) data from the BOLERO-2 trial, which report that 67% of patients who received everolimus and exemestane required dose interruptions or reductions compared to 24% with placebo and exemestane (Rugo et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:808-15). The Committee noted that two thirds of patients receiving everolimus developed stomatitis and that a large proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to this AE. The Committee noted that 8 patients who received everolimus and exemestane died due to AEs compared to 1 AE-related death with placebo and exemestane; and considered the combination of everolimus and exemestane to have a significant toxicity profile. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the BOLERO-2 trial analysis of treatment effects on health-related Quality of Life (QoL), which report a median time to definitive deterioration (TDD) in QoL of 8.3 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 5.8 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.74, P = 0.0084) (Burris et al. Cancer. 2013;119:1908-15). The Committee noted that, at the 10‐point minimal clinically important difference, the median TDD was 11.7 months for everolimus and exemestane compared to 8.4 months for placebo and exemestane, although this result was not statistically significant (HR 0.80; P = .10). The Committee considered the slower deterioration in QoL in patients who received everolimus and exemestane potentially could be attributed to delayed disease progression. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the correlative analysis investigating genetic alterations and everolimus benefit in BOLERO-2 trial patients, which report that PFS with everolimus was generally the same regardless of alteration status (eg PIK3CA, FGFR1, or CCND1 alterations), although patients with chromosomal instability may receive more PFS benefit than those without (Hortobagyi et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:419-26). The Committee considered that there was currently insufficient evidence that genetic markers were predictive of which patients would receive better outcomes from treatment with everolimus. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the open-label, randomised, phase II, three-arm BOLERO-6 trial investigating everolimus with exemestane compared to everolimus alone compared to capecitabine alone, in 309 post-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive), HER2-negative breast cancer (Jerusalem et al. JAMA Oncol. 2018;4:1367-74). The Committee noted that the authors report median OS of</p><p>23.1 months with everolimus plus exemestane compared to 29.3 months with everolimus alone (HR 1.27, 90% CI: 0.95 to 1.70) compared to 25.6 months with capecitabine (HR 1.33, 90% CI: 0.99 to 1.79). The Committee considered that the trial results suggest that there is little difference in benefit from the three treatment arms, although the reported confidence intervals are wide, and the survival curves suggest capecitabine has the greatest benefit.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with tamoxifen </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, open-label, phase II TAMRAD trial which investigated everolimus with tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone in 111 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors (Bachelot et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:2718-24). The Committee noted the authors report median PFS of 8.6 months with everolimus and tamoxifen compared to 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone, and that the risk of death was 55% lower in patients who received everolimus plus tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.81). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Bachelot et al. reported a higher incidence of AEs in patients who received everolimus with tamoxifen compared to those who received tamoxifen alone and considered that the increased toxicity was predominantly due to everolimus. The Committee considered that, although the number of patients in the TAMRAD trial was small, the results were similar to the BOLERO-2 trial results.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with fulvestrant </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase II, PrE0102 trial which investigated everolimus with fulvestrant compared to placebo with fulvestrant in 131 post-menopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Kornblum et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1556-63). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS of 5.1 months with placebo and fulvestrant compared to 10.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.92, P = .02), and median OS of 28.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant compared to 31.4 months with placebo and fulvestrant, although the OS result did not reach statistical significance (HR 1.31, 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.38, P = .37). The Committee considered that these results suggest a benefit of everolimus with fulvestrant in terms of PFS but no OS benefit from this treatment combination.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other evidence </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the open-label, single-arm, phase II BOLERO-4 trial which investigated everolimus with letrozole for the first-line treatment of 202 women with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Royce et al. JAMA Oncol. 2018;4:977-84). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 18.1 to 25.1 months) with everolimus and letrozole, but median OS was not reached. The Committee considered that the BOLERO-4 results suggest much longer PFS compared to BOLERO-2, specifically, that survival of BOLERO-4 patients was about 70% at 3 years compared to survival of BOLERO-2 patients of about 40% at 3 years, however the Committee considered it likely this could be due to differences between the two trial patient populations. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant:</p><p>• Noguchi et al. Breast Cancer. 2014;21:703-14.</p><p>• Beck et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2014;143:459-67.</p><p>• Ciruelos et al. Clin Transl Oncol. 2018;20:753-60.</p><p>• Cazzaniga et al.

Clin Breast Cancer. 2018;18:e197-e203.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General </u></i></p><p>The Committee considered that there was mature evidence for everolimus in the treatment of the requested population but that overall, neither a clinically important OS or PFS benefit was demonstrated. The Committee considered that there were significant limitations in the available evidence, which was of poor quality (ESMO grade 2). The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the appropriate dose of everolimus and concerns about AEs. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a large trial of everolimus compared with a range of aromatase inhibitors (including anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole) is ongoing, however, the Committee considered that any role for everolimus in the treatment paradigm for aBC remained unclear (particularly noting the number of treatments for breast cancer in late stage development and being brought to market internationally, both as monotherapies and in combination regimens).</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee noted that the application from the Breast Cancer Aotearoa Coalition (BCAC) requests funding for everolimus for treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (aBC) in post-menopausal women after recurrence or progression following treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the health need, epidemiology and the current New Zealand treatment paradigm for the treatment of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, aBC have been well documented in recent records of CaTSoP and PTAC meetings regarding the CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and ribociclib (including the record of this PTAC meeting). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, if funded, everolimus would likely be placed in the New Zealand treatment paradigm alongside the CDK4/6 inhibitors as another second-line option for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that everolimus is a protein kinase inhibitor which targets and inhibits mTORC1, a kinase which is critical to many cellular processes and which is dysregulated in most human cancers.

The Committee considered that the trial results suggest that there is little difference in benefit from the three treatment arms, although the reported confidence intervals are wide, and the survival curves suggest capecitabine has the greatest benefit.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with tamoxifen </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, open-label, phase II TAMRAD trial which investigated everolimus with tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone in 111 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors (Bachelot et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:2718-24). The Committee noted the authors report median PFS of 8.6 months with everolimus and tamoxifen compared to 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone, and that the risk of death was 55% lower in patients who received everolimus plus tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.81). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Bachelot et al. reported a higher incidence of AEs in patients who received everolimus with tamoxifen compared to those who received tamoxifen alone and considered that the increased toxicity was predominantly due to everolimus. The Committee considered that, although the number of patients in the TAMRAD trial was small, the results were similar to the BOLERO-2 trial results.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with fulvestrant </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase II, PrE0102 trial which investigated everolimus with fulvestrant compared to placebo with fulvestrant in 131 post-menopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Kornblum et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1556-63). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS of 5.1 months with placebo and fulvestrant compared to 10.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.92, P = .02), and median OS of 28.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant compared to 31.4 months with placebo and fulvestrant, although the OS result did not reach statistical significance (HR 1.31, 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.38, P = .37). The Committee considered that these results suggest a benefit of everolimus with fulvestrant in terms of PFS but no OS benefit from this treatment combination.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other evidence </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the open-label, single-arm, phase II BOLERO-4 trial which investigated everolimus with letrozole for the first-line treatment of 202 women with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Royce et al. JAMA Oncol. 2018;4:977-84). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 18.1 to 25.1 months) with everolimus and letrozole, but median OS was not reached. The Committee considered that the BOLERO-4 results suggest much longer PFS compared to BOLERO-2, specifically, that survival of BOLERO-4 patients was about 70% at 3 years compared to survival of BOLERO-2 patients of about 40% at 3 years, however the Committee considered it likely this could be due to differences between the two trial patient populations. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant:</p><p>• Noguchi et al.

The Committee considered that there were significant limitations in the available evidence, which was of poor quality (ESMO grade 2).

where applicable, PHARMAC’s relevant decision-making framework when considering this agenda item.</p>', 'Published_Discussion__c': '<p>The Committee noted that the application from the Breast Cancer Aotearoa Coalition (BCAC) requests funding for everolimus for treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (aBC) in post-menopausal women after recurrence or progression following treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the health need, epidemiology and the current New Zealand treatment paradigm for the treatment of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, aBC have been well documented in recent records of CaTSoP and PTAC meetings regarding the CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and ribociclib (including the record of this PTAC meeting). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that, if funded, everolimus would likely be placed in the New Zealand treatment paradigm alongside the CDK4/6 inhibitors as another second-line option for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that everolimus is a protein kinase inhibitor which targets and inhibits mTORC1, a kinase which is critical to many cellular processes and which is dysregulated in most human cancers. The Committee noted that mTOR is one of several interconnected cellular pathways and that inhibition of one pathway can cause upregulation of another pathway, therefore the Committee considered that it was important for any treatment which inhibits one or more of these pathways to be supported by sound evidence of efficacy and safety. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that everolimus is not Medsafe-approved for the treatment of aBC, however, it is registered by Medsafe for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours, renal cell carcinoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. The Committee noted that everolimus is administered as a 10 mg oral once daily dose. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the applicant has requested funding for everolimus in combination with exemestane or tamoxifen (both of which are Medsafe-registered and currently funded without restriction) or with fulvestrant (which is not Medsafe-registered and is not currently funded for use in any setting).</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with exemestane </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the key evidence for everolimus in combination with exemestane comes from the randomised, phase III, BOLERO-2 trial which investigated everolimus with exemestane compared to exemestane with placebo in 724 post-menopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous treatment with a nonsteroidal AI (Baselga et al, N Engl J Med. 2012;366:520-9). The Committee noted that 77% of BOLERO-2 patients had bone lesions, 59% of patients had visceral disease, 26% of patients received previous chemotherapy and 20% of patients had received no previous therapy for metastatic breast cancer. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the interim analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) in BOLERO-2, which report investigator-assessed median PFS of 6.9 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 2.8 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.54, P &lt;0.001) (Baselga et al, N Engl J Med. 2012;366:520-9). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the final analysis of PFS of the BOLERO-2 trial which report median PFS of 7.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 3.2 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.54, P&lt;0.001) (Yardley et al. Adv Ther. 2013;30:870-84). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the subgroup analysis of BOLERO-2 trial patients according to visceral involvement status, which report median PFS of 6.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 2.8 months with placebo and exemestane in patients with visceral involvement compared to PFS of 9.9 months and 4.2 months respectively for patients without visceral involvement (Campone et al. Eur J Cancer. 2013;49:2621-32). The Committee considered that the reduced benefit observed for patients with visceral involvement aligned with the poorer prognosis of this patient group as compared to patients without visceral disease. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the subgroup analysis of elderly BOLERO-2 trial patients which report median PFS of 6.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 1.5 months with placebo and exemestane, in patients ages 70 years and over (Pritchard et al. Clin Breast Cancer. 2013;13:421-32.e8). The Committee considered that the results in this elderly subgroup were consistent with other populations. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the final analysis of overall survival (OS) in BOLERO-2 trial patients, which report median OS of 31.0 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 26.6 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.10, P = 0.1426) (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered that even after a reasonably long follow-up duration and with adequate patient numbers contributing to data beyond 3 years, the study was inadequately powered to confirm the reported OS difference and the reported OS results were not statistically significant. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of post-progression survival (PPS) of 492 BOLERO-2 trial patients who had progressed at the time of the final PFS analysis, which report median PPS of 20.8 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 19.3 months with placebo and exemestane (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered the PPS results to be similar in each arm and no survival benefit was demonstrated. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that BOLERO-2 trial patients who received placebo with exemestane were more likely to receive chemotherapy (63%) than patients who received everolimus and exemestane (53%) (Piccart et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:2357-62). The Committee considered that the results reported by Piccart et al. suggest that whether or not a patient received post-trial chemotherapy had no impact on PPS, however, the time to first chemotherapy was longer with everolimus and exemestane (11.9 months) compared to with placebo and exemestane (6.0 months). The Committee considered that investigators may be able to determine which patients were receiving everolimus by the incidence of stomatitis, and consequently that patients thought to be receiving placebo would receive more aggressive therapy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of an analysis of adverse event (AE) data from the BOLERO-2 trial, which report that 67% of patients who received everolimus and exemestane required dose interruptions or reductions compared to 24% with placebo and exemestane (Rugo et al. Ann Oncol. 2014;25:808-15). The Committee noted that two thirds of patients receiving everolimus developed stomatitis and that a large proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to this AE. The Committee noted that 8 patients who received everolimus and exemestane died due to AEs compared to 1 AE-related death with placebo and exemestane; and considered the combination of everolimus and exemestane to have a significant toxicity profile. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the BOLERO-2 trial analysis of treatment effects on health-related Quality of Life (QoL), which report a median time to definitive deterioration (TDD) in QoL of 8.3 months with everolimus and exemestane compared to 5.8 months with placebo and exemestane (HR 0.74, P = 0.0084) (Burris et al. Cancer. 2013;119:1908-15). The Committee noted that, at the 10‐point minimal clinically important difference, the median TDD was 11.7 months for everolimus and exemestane compared to 8.4 months for placebo and exemestane, although this result was not statistically significant (HR 0.80; P = .10). The Committee considered the slower deterioration in QoL in patients who received everolimus and exemestane potentially could be attributed to delayed disease progression. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results from the correlative analysis investigating genetic alterations and everolimus benefit in BOLERO-2 trial patients, which report that PFS with everolimus was generally the same regardless of alteration status (eg PIK3CA, FGFR1, or CCND1 alterations), although patients with chromosomal instability may receive more PFS benefit than those without (Hortobagyi et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:419-26). The Committee considered that there was currently insufficient evidence that genetic markers were predictive of which patients would receive better outcomes from treatment with everolimus. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the open-label, randomised, phase II, three-arm BOLERO-6 trial investigating everolimus with exemestane compared to everolimus alone compared to capecitabine alone, in 309 post-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive), HER2-negative breast cancer (Jerusalem et al. JAMA Oncol. 2018;4:1367-74). The Committee noted that the authors report median OS of</p><p>23.1 months with everolimus plus exemestane compared to 29.3 months with everolimus alone (HR 1.27, 90% CI: 0.95 to 1.70) compared to 25.6 months with capecitabine (HR 1.33, 90% CI: 0.99 to 1.79). The Committee considered that the trial results suggest that there is little difference in benefit from the three treatment arms, although the reported confidence intervals are wide, and the survival curves suggest capecitabine has the greatest benefit.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with tamoxifen </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, open-label, phase II TAMRAD trial which investigated everolimus with tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone in 111 women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors (Bachelot et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30:2718-24). The Committee noted the authors report median PFS of 8.6 months with everolimus and tamoxifen compared to 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone, and that the risk of death was 55% lower in patients who received everolimus plus tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.81). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that Bachelot et al. reported a higher incidence of AEs in patients who received everolimus with tamoxifen compared to those who received tamoxifen alone and considered that the increased toxicity was predominantly due to everolimus. The Committee considered that, although the number of patients in the TAMRAD trial was small, the results were similar to the BOLERO-2 trial results.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Everolimus with fulvestrant </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase II, PrE0102 trial which investigated everolimus with fulvestrant compared to placebo with fulvestrant in 131 post-menopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Kornblum et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;36:1556-63). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS of 5.1 months with placebo and fulvestrant compared to 10.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.92, P = .02), and median OS of 28.3 months with everolimus and fulvestrant compared to 31.4 months with placebo and fulvestrant, although the OS result did not reach statistical significance (HR 1.31, 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.38, P = .37). The Committee considered that these results suggest a benefit of everolimus with fulvestrant in terms of PFS but no OS benefit from this treatment combination.</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>Other evidence </u></i></p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the open-label, single-arm, phase II BOLERO-4 trial which investigated everolimus with letrozole for the first-line treatment of 202 women with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative aBC (Royce et al. JAMA Oncol. 2018;4:977-84). The Committee noted that the authors report median PFS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 18.1 to 25.1 months) with everolimus and letrozole, but median OS was not reached. The Committee considered that the BOLERO-4 results suggest much longer PFS compared to BOLERO-2, specifically, that survival of BOLERO-4 patients was about 70% at 3 years compared to survival of BOLERO-2 patients of about 40% at 3 years, however the Committee considered it likely this could be due to differences between the two trial patient populations. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the following evidence provided by the applicant:</p><p>• Noguchi et al.
