evidence that was not directly applicable to the New Zealand setting; the risks of high uptake, potential misuse and diversion; the absence of exit criteria; and uncertainty of long-term dependence and tolerance with esketamine. At that time, PTAC also considered there was a risk that patients with TRD may inappropriately receive esketamine ahead of other suitable treatments or strategies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the supplier had responded to the February 2020 PTAC record regarding the application for esketamine for TRD; the Committee noted that this response would be reviewed and considered outside the current meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the substantial health need of patients with depression and that mental health issues are the third greatest contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost in New Zealand, with depression the greatest contributor to this loss for women (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/health-loss-in-new-zealand-1990-2013-aug16.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ministry of Health, 2016</a>). The Committee noted that depression has a disproportionate impact on people with low socioeconomic status (<a href=""https://minhealthnz.shinyapps.io/nz-health-survey-2018-19-annual-data-explorer/_w_91fcf95d/_w_aa474b78/#!/explore-indicators"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ministry of Health. 2018/19</a>). As such, the Committee recognised the need for new treatment options that show clear, sustained improvement for this chronic condition.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there are challenges in that definitions of various types of depression (according to clinical guidelines) are difficult to use to strictly define a specific clinical population. The Committee noted that, despite challenges with definitions, the patient population with major depression is a much larger group (and with a lower threshold proposed for eligibility for esketamine) than that previously considered for treatment-resistant depression, and considered that the latter is a subgroup of major depressive disorder. The Committee considered that an accurate and fulsome diagnosis of major depressive disorder could not be done without psychiatric assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that a substantial proportion of people with major depressive disorder have some degree of suicidal intent and considered that assessment of active intent would be subjective and inconsistent between clinicians and clinical settings. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the available evidence does not provide a clear or consistent definition of &#39;major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent&#39; and that this is not a separate disease entity that is recognised in clinical practice.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that, while there is an association between suicidal ideation and completed suicide described in the literature at a population level, the association at an individual level was unclear. Members considered that there is no evidence that individual interventions reduce the population rate of suicide, and that appropriate measures for suicide prevention would likely be public health measures.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that 20% of the New Zealand population have mental health or substance abuse disorders using lifetime prevalence data (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/mental-health-survey.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Oakley Browne, 2006</a>). The Committee noted that the lifetime risk of depression in New Zealand is about 16% (<a href=""https://minhealthnz.shinyapps.io/nz-health-survey-2018-19-annual-data-explorer/_w_91fcf95d/#!/explore-indicators"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ministry of Health, 2019</a>), equating to about 350,000 people in New Zealand of whom 20-30% have treatment-resistant depression (<a href=""https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.11.1905?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Rush et al. Am J Psychiatry. 2006;136:1905-17</a>). The Committee noted that greater rates of mental health problems, including suicide are reported in Māori compared with non-Māori.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the supplier’s patient number estimates were significantly lower than the potentially eligible population. The Committee considered that, with a suicidal ideation rate of a third of all depressed patients, that up to 110,000 people in New Zealand could fit the proposed eligibility criteria for esketamine for the treatment of major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that funded treatments for depression were described by PTAC in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">February 2020</a> and that no treatments are specifically funded for major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation, as this is not a specifically defined condition in clinical practice. The Committee noted the current Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists treatment algorithm for patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder is consistent with treatment of such patients in most developed countries (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0004867415617657?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Malhi et al. Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2015;49:1087-206</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the patient population described by this application i.e. those with major depressive disorder, would receive usual funded pharmaceutical and other treatment for major depressive disorder, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) reserved for the subset of people with very severe treatment-refractory depression (largely in older people). Members considered that a significant proportion of this patient population would be managed by secondary DHB psychiatric services.</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that ECT requires administration by an RANZCP-credentialled clinician in a theatre setting, and therefore use is constrained by theatre time and clinician availability. It was considered that it would be used only in patients with longstanding, severe depression or in some acute cases e.g. including patients with catatonic depression, hallucinations and inability to eat or drink. As such, ECT was not considered to be an appropriate comparator, or particularly relevant, for this population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the pharmacological properties and administration (including substantial healthcare resource) of esketamine was described by PTAC in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">February 2020</a> and that esketamine has since been approved by Medsafe for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have active suicidal ideation with intent. The Committee noted that esketamine is a class 4 controlled drug administered intranasally, with mucosal systemic absorption occurring in about 10 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that esketamine is proposed to be used as an adjunctive treatment to achieve rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients defined as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent.\xa0Administration was for four weeks with oral antidepressants, and other appropriate therapy, continued as per clinical judgement. The Committee considered it was unclear how esketamine would be appropriately incorporated into the established treatment paradigm from a pragmatic perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the 60-point Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is often used in trials of treatments for major depressive disorder and also in the trials considered in this application. The Committee noted that different methods have been used to provide different minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) in MADRS ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 (with statistical distribution methods) to requiring a decrease of about 8-10 points for classification of remission (anchor-based methods). Members considered anchor-based methods of understanding MCID using the MADRS to reflect clinical reality more closely. Members noted that MADRS provides a scale for measurement of depression; but not ‘with suicidal ideation’ and that the MADRS does not predict who will complete suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled ASPIRE-1 trial. This included 226 adults aged 18-64 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with active suicidal intent, without psychotic features. They received intranasal esketamine 84 mg plus a new antidepressant (N=114) or intranasal placebo plus a new antidepressant (N=112) for four weeks with follow-up to nine weeks post treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412700/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Fu et al. J Clin Psychiatry. 2020;81:19m13191</a>). The Committee noted that the trial included patients with mean baseline MADRS of 41.1 and excluded patients with many comorbidities and other problems (e.g. substance abuse) that may exist in the target population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that ASPIRE-1 was designed as an efficacy trial and noted that the placebo included a bittering agent, however, the Committee considered that the dissociative effect of the active treatment would be obvious compared to placebo and could thus impact the study blinding.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that extended hospitalisation i.e. 25 days as in some clinical trials, different anti-depressant treatments and psychosocial variables as likely to influence the improvement of major depression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary outcome of ASPIRE-1 was a decrease in MADRS score at 24 hours, although the trial did not specify a MCID for this outcome, and that the least squares mean difference in MADRS score from baseline to 24 hours was -3.8 (standard error=1.39; 95% CI: -6.56 to -1.09, P=0.006). The Committee noted that the difference in MADRS between groups generally was maintained over time through to the end of follow-up, and considered that it was difficult to gauge the clinical significance of these small differences in MADRS (esketamine vs placebo) at 24 hours and at day 25. The Committee noted there was no statistically significant difference in severity of suicidality at 24 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence from ASPIRE-1 was of high quality and generalisable to the New Zealand context, other than the prolonged hospital admissions which were considered significantly different from usual care in New Zealand. The Committee noted the results of the phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled ASPIRE-2 trial. This occurred in 230 adults aged 18-64 years with major depressive disorder and active suicidal ideation. They received twice-weekly esketamine (84 mg intranasal) plus standard of care or intranasal placebo plus standard of care for four weeks (<a href=""https://www.cochranelibrary.com/es/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02051443/full"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ionescu et al.

Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2020; DOI: 10.1093/ijnp/pyaa068 [Epub ahead of print]</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that participants saw an emergency department doctor, agreed to participate in the trial and were admitted to hospital (mean 22 days). The Committee noted that participants self-administered questionnaires after 24 hours describing their symptoms.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that ASPIRE-2 participants had a mean baseline MADRS of 39.7 and could receive up to 6 mg of lorazepam daily. The Committee considered it was unclear how many participants received benzodiazepines, which could substantially impact a patient’s affective state at the primary end point.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the trial’s exclusion criteria would have excluded a substantial proportion of the New Zealand patient population being treated on psychiatric wards for major depressive disorders.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that some antidepressants used in ASPIRE-2 e.g. duloxetine, are not funded for use in New Zealand for treatment of depression, which the Committee considered limited the applicability of this evidence to the New Zealand population. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also considered that the time frame for hospital admission (mean 22 days) significant limited generalisability to the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary outcome was assessed at four hours after the first dose, when patients would still be dissociated, and that missing data was imputed with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Although it was unclear how many datapoints were affected by LOCF, the Committee considered this could potentially pose a significant bias.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the ASPIRE-2 trial specified an MCID of 6 for the MADRS. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the least squares mean difference change in MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours was -3.9 (95% CI: -6.60 to -1.11, P=0.006); a difference of 3.3 in mean MADRS score was reported, with mean decrease in MADRS of -15.7 with esketamine compared with -12.4 with placebo (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ijnp/pyaa068/5899217"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ionescu et al. 2020</a>), however, the Committee noted that results at all other timepoints were not statistically significant and considered these results were not clinically meaningful. The Committee noted that the trial reported no statistically significant difference in suicidality score between groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the phase II, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled PERSEVERE trial. This included 68 adults aged 19-64 with major depressive disorder at imminent risk of suicide who received twice-weekly esketamine (84 mg intranasally) or placebo for four weeks, with eight weeks of follow-up (<a href=""https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17060720?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Canuso et al. Am J Psychiatry. 2018;175:620-30</a>). Members noted that participants received trial treatment within inpatient psychiatric units in the US, and considered the healthcare and duration of hospital stay would be different to that of New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that patients in PERSEVERE had less severe depression at baseline compared to ASPIRE-1 and ASPIRE-2 participants. The Committee noted that the trial was powered for a MCID mean change in MADRS of 6, and also measured for suicidal ideation, rather than suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there was a statistically significant difference in MADRS at 24 hours (least squares mean difference in MADRS from baseline to 24 hours post-treatment was -7.2 (± SE 2.85, P=0.015); effect size 0.65. The Committee noted this separation between groups disappeared by 25 days (least squares mean difference in MADRS from baseline to four weeks post-treatment was -4.5, (± SE 3.14, P=0.159); effect size 0.35. The Committee noted that there was no difference in suicidality between groups and that there was no statistically significant improvement in MADRS at eight weeks, which was the primary study endpoint.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that PERSEVERE participants appeared to benefit from the addition of another antidepressant and four weeks of hospital care while on the trial. Members considered that the known dissociative effect of esketamine likely provided some brief relief from depression, although this was not clearly long-term.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the toxicity profile of esketamine included dizziness, dissociation, nausea, cognitive impairment and transient blood pressure increases that could be a significant issue for people with cardiovascular disease or severe hypertension. The Committee noted that esketamine is contraindicated with patients with cardiovascular risk factors (<a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/s/spravatonasalspray.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Medsafe Data Sheet, 2019</a>).

Neuropsychopharmacology. 2019;44:385–538. Abstract W130. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-019-0547-9</a>)</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the clinical trials provided high quality evidence of a statistically significant difference in MADRS at 24-hours; no difference in MADRS at 25 days; and no difference in suicidal intent. The Committee noted the trials did not consistently show a mean difference in MARDS close to the MCID in their primary end points. The Committee noted that the trials did not include outcomes regarding suicide and therefore could not inform whether the intervention changed the suicide rate within the trial patient groups; noting that different outcomes would be needed to study suicide prevention on a population level. Overall, the Committee considered that there was a lack of a clinically relevant benefit and poor generalisability to New Zealand population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that major depressive disorder is of at least two weeks duration by definition and considered that an improvement of only 24-hours is unlikely to convey benefits to family/whānau or wider society.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is an addiction risk with esketamine and that esketamine has the potential to cause a substance abuse disorder, with impacts on patients, family/whānau and children. The Committee considered that the supplier’s Risk Mitigation Plan did not provide enough detail on how this risk would be managed and left a significant degree of uncertainty as to use of product in the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it was unclear who would provide and dispose of the metered dose nasal spray pumps, and members considered that the disposal of a large number of single-use devices would be a potential environmental concern.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that in order to provide treatment with esketamine, patients should be admitted to hospital, and considered that it was unclear how this would be managed, noting that clinical trial participants may have stayed in hospital for a longer period than for current standard care in New Zealand (~10 days).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that administration, implementation and support of esketamine as proposed would require substantial service provision; would significantly impact health services including primary healthcare services; and would require substantial upfront and ongoing costs for treatment facilities, staff and patient monitoring. Members considered that patients should see a psychiatrist in person for assessment prior to being prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that any accessibility issues would have the potential to increase access inequities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria proposed by the supplier for esketamine for the treatment of patients defined as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent did not require a patient to have treatment-resistant depression or be hospitalised; required a need for rapid relief; and excluded several related disorders e.g. addiction and dependency. The Committee considered that the criteria as proposed could not be implemented consistently or easily in the New Zealand setting to target funded treatment appropriately to those with severe depression, and that it would potentially discriminate against patients at need e.g. those with addiction/dependency. The Committee noted that the proposed Special Authority criteria did not include stopping rules, observation requirements, appropriate dispensing, or renewal criteria; many of which would be required to appropriately target funded treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that uptake of esketamine would likely be influenced by marketing and resources available for treatment. Members considered that if esketamine were funded, it may also be appealing to patients with other conditions comorbid with depression and their prescribers, increasing the risk of ‘slippage’ of funded treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that health utility would be required to be incorporated into economic modelling, and that data for prevention or completion of suicide was not available. The Committee considered that the evidence for MADRS was not associated with suicidality.

Members considered that a significant proportion of this patient population would be managed by secondary DHB psychiatric services.</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that ECT requires administration by an RANZCP-credentialled clinician in a theatre setting, and therefore use is constrained by theatre time and clinician availability. It was considered that it would be used only in patients with longstanding, severe depression or in some acute cases e.g. including patients with catatonic depression, hallucinations and inability to eat or drink. As such, ECT was not considered to be an appropriate comparator, or particularly relevant, for this population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the pharmacological properties and administration (including substantial healthcare resource) of esketamine was described by PTAC in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">February 2020</a> and that esketamine has since been approved by Medsafe for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have active suicidal ideation with intent.

The Committee considered it was unclear how esketamine would be appropriately incorporated into the established treatment paradigm from a pragmatic perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the 60-point Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is often used in trials of treatments for major depressive disorder and also in the trials considered in this application. The Committee noted that different methods have been used to provide different minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) in MADRS ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 (with statistical distribution methods) to requiring a decrease of about 8-10 points for classification of remission (anchor-based methods). Members considered anchor-based methods of understanding MCID using the MADRS to reflect clinical reality more closely. Members noted that MADRS provides a scale for measurement of depression; but not ‘with suicidal ideation’ and that the MADRS does not predict who will complete suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled ASPIRE-1 trial. This included 226 adults aged 18-64 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with active suicidal intent, without psychotic features. They received intranasal esketamine 84 mg plus a new antidepressant (N=114) or intranasal placebo plus a new antidepressant (N=112) for four weeks with follow-up to nine weeks post treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412700/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Fu et al.

The Committee noted that the difference in MADRS between groups generally was maintained over time through to the end of follow-up, and considered that it was difficult to gauge the clinical significance of these small differences in MADRS (esketamine vs placebo) at 24 hours and at day 25.

The Committee noted the trials did not consistently show a mean difference in MARDS close to the MCID in their primary end points. The Committee noted that the trials did not include outcomes regarding suicide and therefore could not inform whether the intervention changed the suicide rate within the trial patient groups; noting that different outcomes would be needed to study suicide prevention on a population level. Overall, the Committee considered that there was a lack of a clinically relevant benefit and poor generalisability to New Zealand population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that major depressive disorder is of at least two weeks duration by definition and considered that an improvement of only 24-hours is unlikely to convey benefits to family/whānau or wider society.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is an addiction risk with esketamine and that esketamine has the potential to cause a substance abuse disorder, with impacts on patients, family/whānau and children.

Members considered that patients should see a psychiatrist in person for assessment prior to being prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that any accessibility issues would have the potential to increase access inequities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria proposed by the supplier for esketamine for the treatment of patients defined as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent did not require a patient to have treatment-resistant depression or be hospitalised; required a need for rapid relief; and excluded several related disorders e.g. addiction and dependency. The Committee considered that the criteria as proposed could not be implemented consistently or easily in the New Zealand setting to target funded treatment appropriately to those with severe depression, and that it would potentially discriminate against patients at need e.g. those with addiction/dependency. The Committee noted that the proposed Special Authority criteria did not include stopping rules, observation requirements, appropriate dispensing, or renewal criteria; many of which would be required to appropriately target funded treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that uptake of esketamine would likely be influenced by marketing and resources available for treatment.

The Committee noted the current Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists treatment algorithm for patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder is consistent with treatment of such patients in most developed countries (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0004867415617657?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Malhi et al.

Members considered that a significant proportion of this patient population would be managed by secondary DHB psychiatric services.</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that ECT requires administration by an RANZCP-credentialled clinician in a theatre setting, and therefore use is constrained by theatre time and clinician availability. It was considered that it would be used only in patients with longstanding, severe depression or in some acute cases e.g. including patients with catatonic depression, hallucinations and inability to eat or drink. As such, ECT was not considered to be an appropriate comparator, or particularly relevant, for this population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the pharmacological properties and administration (including substantial healthcare resource) of esketamine was described by PTAC in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-02.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">February 2020</a> and that esketamine has since been approved by Medsafe for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have active suicidal ideation with intent. The Committee noted that esketamine is a class 4 controlled drug administered intranasally, with mucosal systemic absorption occurring in about 10 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that esketamine is proposed to be used as an adjunctive treatment to achieve rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients defined as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent.\xa0Administration was for four weeks with oral antidepressants, and other appropriate therapy, continued as per clinical judgement. The Committee considered it was unclear how esketamine would be appropriately incorporated into the established treatment paradigm from a pragmatic perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the 60-point Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is often used in trials of treatments for major depressive disorder and also in the trials considered in this application. The Committee noted that different methods have been used to provide different minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) in MADRS ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 (with statistical distribution methods) to requiring a decrease of about 8-10 points for classification of remission (anchor-based methods). Members considered anchor-based methods of understanding MCID using the MADRS to reflect clinical reality more closely. Members noted that MADRS provides a scale for measurement of depression; but not ‘with suicidal ideation’ and that the MADRS does not predict who will complete suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled ASPIRE-1 trial. This included 226 adults aged 18-64 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with active suicidal intent, without psychotic features. They received intranasal esketamine 84 mg plus a new antidepressant (N=114) or intranasal placebo plus a new antidepressant (N=112) for four weeks with follow-up to nine weeks post treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412700/"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Fu et al. J Clin Psychiatry. 2020;81:19m13191</a>). The Committee noted that the trial included patients with mean baseline MADRS of 41.1 and excluded patients with many comorbidities and other problems (e.g. substance abuse) that may exist in the target population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that ASPIRE-1 was designed as an efficacy trial and noted that the placebo included a bittering agent, however, the Committee considered that the dissociative effect of the active treatment would be obvious compared to placebo and could thus impact the study blinding.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that extended hospitalisation i.e. 25 days as in some clinical trials, different anti-depressant treatments and psychosocial variables as likely to influence the improvement of major depression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the primary outcome of ASPIRE-1 was a decrease in MADRS score at 24 hours, although the trial did not specify a MCID for this outcome, and that the least squares mean difference in MADRS score from baseline to 24 hours was -3.8 (standard error=1.39; 95% CI: -6.56 to -1.09, P=0.006). The Committee noted that the difference in MADRS between groups generally was maintained over time through to the end of follow-up, and considered that it was difficult to gauge the clinical significance of these small differences in MADRS (esketamine vs placebo) at 24 hours and at day 25. The Committee noted there was no statistically significant difference in severity of suicidality at 24 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence from ASPIRE-1 was of high quality and generalisable to the New Zealand context, other than the prolonged hospital admissions which were considered significantly different from usual care in New Zealand. The Committee noted the results of the phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled ASPIRE-2 trial. This occurred in 230 adults aged 18-64 years with major depressive disorder and active suicidal ideation. They received twice-weekly esketamine (84 mg intranasal) plus standard of care or intranasal placebo plus standard of care for four weeks (<a href=""https://www.cochranelibrary.com/es/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02051443/full"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: windowtext;"">Ionescu et al.

The Committee noted this separation between groups disappeared by 25 days (least squares mean difference in MADRS from baseline to four weeks post-treatment was -4.5, (± SE 3.14, P=0.159); effect size 0.35. The Committee noted that there was no difference in suicidality between groups and that there was no statistically significant improvement in MADRS at eight weeks, which was the primary study endpoint.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that PERSEVERE participants appeared to benefit from the addition of another antidepressant and four weeks of hospital care while on the trial.

Abstract W130. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-019-0547-9</a>)</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the clinical trials provided high quality evidence of a statistically significant difference in MADRS at 24-hours; no difference in MADRS at 25 days; and no difference in suicidal intent. The Committee noted the trials did not consistently show a mean difference in MARDS close to the MCID in their primary end points. The Committee noted that the trials did not include outcomes regarding suicide and therefore could not inform whether the intervention changed the suicide rate within the trial patient groups; noting that different outcomes would be needed to study suicide prevention on a population level. Overall, the Committee considered that there was a lack of a clinically relevant benefit and poor generalisability to New Zealand population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that major depressive disorder is of at least two weeks duration by definition and considered that an improvement of only 24-hours is unlikely to convey benefits to family/whānau or wider society.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is an addiction risk with esketamine and that esketamine has the potential to cause a substance abuse disorder, with impacts on patients, family/whānau and children. The Committee considered that the supplier’s Risk Mitigation Plan did not provide enough detail on how this risk would be managed and left a significant degree of uncertainty as to use of product in the New Zealand context.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it was unclear who would provide and dispose of the metered dose nasal spray pumps, and members considered that the disposal of a large number of single-use devices would be a potential environmental concern.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that in order to provide treatment with esketamine, patients should be admitted to hospital, and considered that it was unclear how this would be managed, noting that clinical trial participants may have stayed in hospital for a longer period than for current standard care in New Zealand (~10 days).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that administration, implementation and support of esketamine as proposed would require substantial service provision; would significantly impact health services including primary healthcare services; and would require substantial upfront and ongoing costs for treatment facilities, staff and patient monitoring. Members considered that patients should see a psychiatrist in person for assessment prior to being prescribed esketamine. The Committee considered that any accessibility issues would have the potential to increase access inequities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria proposed by the supplier for esketamine for the treatment of patients defined as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation with intent did not require a patient to have treatment-resistant depression or be hospitalised; required a need for rapid relief; and excluded several related disorders e.g. addiction and dependency. The Committee considered that the criteria as proposed could not be implemented consistently or easily in the New Zealand setting to target funded treatment appropriately to those with severe depression, and that it would potentially discriminate against patients at need e.g. those with addiction/dependency. The Committee noted that the proposed Special Authority criteria did not include stopping rules, observation requirements, appropriate dispensing, or renewal criteria; many of which would be required to appropriately target funded treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that uptake of esketamine would likely be influenced by marketing and resources available for treatment. Members considered that if esketamine were funded, it may also be appealing to patients with other conditions comorbid with depression and their prescribers, increasing the risk of ‘slippage’ of funded treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that health utility would be required to be incorporated into economic modelling, and that data for prevention or completion of suicide was not available. The Committee considered that the evidence for MADRS was not associated with suicidality. Members considered that ECT would not be a comparator treatment for modelling purposes in this patient population, and that esketamine would be used in combination with other antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The Committee considered that the availability of esketamine would be unlikely to change the use of ECT, which occurs at a low rate in a subset of high need patients.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Committee considered that despite the high health need of this patient population, the evidence did not indicate that esketamine would provide a clinically meaningful benefit for patients with major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation, and considered that esketamine would be associated with a number of possible risks and impacts for patients, their families/whānau, wider society and the health system.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that a majority of the concerns raised in February 2020 by the Committee in regard to the application for esketamine for treatment-resistant depression remained applicable for this application in the broader population described as having major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation, although noted that the supplier’s correspondence regarding the February 2020 record would be reviewed outside of this meeting.</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000Ccx8QAC'}, 'change': None}]",Oct 2020,False,True
