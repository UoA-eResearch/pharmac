Anaemia is present in almost three quarters of new presentations, with bone pain and elevated creatinine a feature in about half.</p><p><br></p><p>While the applicant requested use of teniposide in patients progressive through treatment with a proteasome inhibitor as well as lenalidomide, the Subcommittee noted that, in 2017, transplant eligible patients will have progressed through a bone marrow transplant procedure and through two lines of immunomodulating agents - thalidomide and lenalidomide. Thus the application would be essentially for use of teniposide as part of fourth line therapy in a group of patients who are very unwell.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that refractory MM patients may have pain and be at risk of fracture with a life expectancy measured in short months. The Subcommittee noted that the primary goal of therapy for these patients is symptom improvement and to improve quality of life, with survival (prolongation of life) as a secondary goal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the risk of MM is approximately 40% higher in males than females, and that Māori and Pacific Islanders have a substantially higher risk of being diagnosed with, and dying from, MM than non-Māori. It is not clear why there is a higher risk of MM in Māori and Pacific Islanders.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that teniposide is a very old drug which does not currently have Medsafe approval. It is delivered via intravenous infusion.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the most widely used funded treatment options for MM include bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, melphalan and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients, with the choice of treatment driven by patient fitness/comorbidities and eligibility for transplantation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the applicant sought teniposide in the multiply relapsed MM population which have few treatment options and typically have progressive bone disease with pain and bone fractures and a poor prognosis of weeks to months. The Subcommittee considered that the health need of this population was high.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in 2017, the alternative unfunded treatments for this patient group in a New Zealand context would be compassionate access carfilzomib, a clinical trial with either an antiCD38 or anti PD-1 therapy, or supportive care. Members noted that they had previously recommended pomalidomide for funding for patients in this setting but it remains unfunded.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the report from Tirelli et al (Am J Clin Oncol. 1985;8:329-31) dating from 1985 - a single agent phase II trial of 30 patients. Of the study population only 25 were evaluable for response due to loss of follow-up due to early death. Members noted that the authors concluded that the drug has some activity - with 7 responses in the study population using Myeloma Task Force definitions of response (half of whom were previously untreated). The responses were of short duration - median 4 months. Toxicity was not well reported. Emesis appeared to be the primary toxicity contributed to the combination. The Subcommittee noted that in 2017 emesis regimens would be significantly improved so this was unlikely to be such a therapeutic issue.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the report from Leoni et al. (Leuk Lymphoma. 1992;7:481- 7), who published a combination study of teniposide in 43 patients with refractory MM, 37 evaluable (again due to loss to follow-up due to early death). Prior therapy was by 2017 standards historic - as current patients will be more heavily pre-treated so the therapeutic response may be overestimated. Teniposide was used in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. Response was assessed using levels of myeloma protein or marrow indices which is usual in myeloma studies. A Major response was achieved in 18 patients (50% of the patient cohort) and a minor response in a further 9 patients. The report does describe that almost all patients receiving teniposide in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone experienced relief of bone pain and &quot;an amelioration of their performance status&quot; which is encouraging. Toxicity was deemed acceptable by the authors but is not described in any detail, and with two early deaths is concerning.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted two abstract presentations detailing the responses of 23 heavily pre-treated MM patients receiving teniposide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone chemotherapy at North Shore Hospital, Auckland between January 2012 and July 2014. Twelve patients (52.2%) completed 4-6 cycles chemotherapy containing tenoposide. Treatment response could be calculated in 20 out of the 23 patients in the cohort. Although responses were reported differently in the abstracts, it appears that an overall response rate of 27% was observed. This represents the three patients with a partial response and three having a very good partial response. The median time to progression/next treatment for the 17 patients with partial response or stable disease was 5.2 months. During the follow-up period, 12 of the 23 patients died (52.2%). Toxicity is not described in any detail with the authors reporting that the chemotherapy was fairly-well tolerated with more than half the patients completing 4 to 6 cycles, and only one dying from chemotherapy related toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a review of the comparative analysis of single-agent drug activity in MM (Kortuem et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2014;14:284-90). Based on the activity of teniposide in the Tirelli et al study, Korteum et al. rated teniposide response as just above their proposed threshold of interest of &gt;22%.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence shows that teniposide does have some limited activity in multiple myeloma. However the level of evidence to support the funding application for use in combination therapy in a heavily pre-treated population, in a 2017 context, is very poor. All the papers suffer from major quality issues, but were published at a time when there was lower publication rigor. All report non-randomised data. The definitions of response and durability of response are unclear, the clinical benefit is unclear and the toxicity impacts are poorly reported. The Subcommittee considered that the applicability of both the Tirelli and Leoni et al. trials to current practice was limited. It is clear that it may add toxicity and as the patient population in 2017 is more heavily pre-treated it could be argued that the potential for toxicity (eg myelosuppression and neurotoxicity) is higher now than at the time of the Tirelli and Leoni papers. There is no quality of life data to support its use and the overall clinical benefit analysis cannot be proven. There is uncertainty as to how much additional benefit teniposide adds to high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide in this population.</p><p><br></p><p>There are now several additional options for prior lines of treatment and the singleagent regimen in Tirelli et al with a large proportion of previously untreated patients is not relevant in the setting applied for.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered it remained unclear whether reported symptom improvement was observed due to the concomitant administration of high-dose steroids.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the PEP-C regimen (prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine and cyclophosphamide) was funded and being used in this multiply relapsed MM population as a last-line palliative treatment option. The Subcommittee considered that this was likely a more suitable treatment, that would be preferred by most clinicians, as it was an oral regimen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the fiscal risk of funding teniposide was low, given that only approximately 20 patients per annum would be likely to access this treatment if available. The Subcommittee considered that while there would be additional infusions and management of toxicity (including issues related to myelosuppression), this is likely to be of little impact to Day and Inpatient units, so Health Sector impact was considered minimal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although patients with multiply relapsed MM were likely very unwell, symptomatic and had a life-expectancy of only a few months, the evidence for the use of teniposide in this indication was of poor quality and weak strength, particularly for quality of life gains or a durable response, and additional toxicity was a concern.

Toxicity is not described in any detail with the authors reporting that the chemotherapy was fairly-well tolerated with more than half the patients completing 4 to 6 cycles, and only one dying from chemotherapy related toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a review of the comparative analysis of single-agent drug activity in MM (Kortuem et al. Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2014;14:284-90). Based on the activity of teniposide in the Tirelli et al study, Korteum et al. rated teniposide response as just above their proposed threshold of interest of &gt;22%.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence shows that teniposide does have some limited activity in multiple myeloma. However the level of evidence to support the funding application for use in combination therapy in a heavily pre-treated population, in a 2017 context, is very poor. All the papers suffer from major quality issues, but were published at a time when there was lower publication rigor. All report non-randomised data. The definitions of response and durability of response are unclear, the clinical benefit is unclear and the toxicity impacts are poorly reported. The Subcommittee considered that the applicability of both the Tirelli and Leoni et al. trials to current practice was limited. It is clear that it may add toxicity and as the patient population in 2017 is more heavily pre-treated it could be argued that the potential for toxicity (eg myelosuppression and neurotoxicity) is higher now than at the time of the Tirelli and Leoni papers. There is no quality of life data to support its use and the overall clinical benefit analysis cannot be proven. There is uncertainty as to how much additional benefit teniposide adds to high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide in this population.</p><p><br></p><p>There are now several additional options for prior lines of treatment and the singleagent regimen in Tirelli et al with a large proportion of previously untreated patients is not relevant in the setting applied for.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered it remained unclear whether reported symptom improvement was observed due to the concomitant administration of high-dose steroids.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the PEP-C regimen (prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine and cyclophosphamide) was funded and being used in this multiply relapsed MM population as a last-line palliative treatment option. The Subcommittee considered that this was likely a more suitable treatment, that would be preferred by most clinicians, as it was an oral regimen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the fiscal risk of funding teniposide was low, given that only approximately 20 patients per annum would be likely to access this treatment if available. The Subcommittee considered that while there would be additional infusions and management of toxicity (including issues related to myelosuppression), this is likely to be of little impact to Day and Inpatient units, so Health Sector impact was considered minimal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although patients with multiply relapsed MM were likely very unwell, symptomatic and had a life-expectancy of only a few months, the evidence for the use of teniposide in this indication was of poor quality and weak strength, particularly for quality of life gains or a durable response, and additional toxicity was a concern. The Subcommittee concluded that the evidence of a net health benefit remained insufficient at this time to recommend funding.</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000ArGRQA0'}, 'change': None}]",Mar 2017,False,True
