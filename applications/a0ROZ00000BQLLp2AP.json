The Committee considered the additional follow up from the NeoSphere trial had small participant numbers and noted the confidence interval of the relative PFS in treatment compared to non-treatment overlapped. The Committee considered that the assessment of the impact of pertuzumab on PFS was not strong based on this evidence. The Committee noted the PEONY study comparing those treated with docetaxel and trastuzumab alone with those treated with docetaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. The Committee noted that the trial reported a higher objective response rate (78% v 88%) and higher statistically significant pCR in the pertuzumab arm of the trial. The Committee noted that no OS or PFS data was reported in the paper. The Committee considered these outcomes were similar to the initial NeoSphere trial assessed in 2018.

The Committee noted that an increasing proportion of trials of neoadjuvant therapies for HER2+ breast cancer contained pertuzumab as part of their backbone, and this reflected use of pertuzumab as standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting in other jurisdictions. The Committee considered given the use of neoadjuvant pertuzumab as standard of care in many other countries, that it was unlikely additional evidence would become available for this indication. </p><p><br></p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pertuzumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2+ breast cancer.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>1.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for pertuzumab for neoadjuvant treatment for HER2+ve, locally advanced, inflammatory or early-stage breast cancer was assessed by the Committee at their <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">September 2018 meeting</a>. The Committee had recommended this application be declined based on insufficient evidence and considered that any reconsideration would require additional evidence powered to detect a progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefit. </p><p><br></p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the first trials (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(11)70336-9/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Gianni L, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2012;13(1):25-32</a> and <a href=\"https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(19)36929-7/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Schneeweiss A, et al. Ann Oncol. 2013;24(9):2278-84</a>) were in large heterogenous populations with high response rates but no clear survival benefit. The Committee considered that there was now supporting data that there was high pCR (pathological complete response) in certain phenotypes including HER2+ at 39-60%, which may correlate with a survival advantage. </p><p><br></p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis which reported that pCR was associated with improved event free survival and overall survival (OS) compared to non-pCR (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2492724\" target=\"_blank\">Broglio et al. JAMA Oncol. 2016;2: 751-760</a>). The Committee considered that the magnitudes of the associations between pCR and these final clinical endpoints were uncertain, limiting the ability to predict the absolute overall survival of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. The Committee noted however that in other jurisdictions, pCR was accepted as a surrogate marker for OS. </p><p><br></p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered correspondence from the supplier (Roche) with further evidence to support its initial application. The Committee considered the 5-year follow up from the initial NeoSphere trial (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)00163-7/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Gianni L, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2016;17(6):791-800</a>) and PEONY trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813591/\" target=\"_blank\">Shao Z, et al. JAMA Oncol. 2020;6(3):e193692</a>). The Committee considered the additional follow up from the NeoSphere trial had small participant numbers and noted the confidence interval of the relative PFS in treatment compared to non-treatment overlapped. The Committee considered that the assessment of the impact of pertuzumab on PFS was not strong based on this evidence. The Committee noted the PEONY study comparing those treated with docetaxel and trastuzumab alone with those treated with docetaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. The Committee noted that the trial reported a higher objective response rate (78% v 88%) and higher statistically significant pCR in the pertuzumab arm of the trial. The Committee noted that no OS or PFS data was reported in the paper. The Committee considered these outcomes were similar to the initial NeoSphere trial assessed in 2018. The Committee considered the low score from European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical benefit scale, but noted the PEONY trial was not considered in this score. </p><p><br></p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted seven other studies submitted by the supplier and considered they were not relevant to the application, as they contained pertuzumab in all trial arms and therefore did not provide evidence of the incremental benefit associated with pertuzumab. The Committee noted that generally, the earlier treatment was more beneficial in oncology indications. The Committee noted that an increasing proportion of trials of neoadjuvant therapies for HER2+ breast cancer contained pertuzumab as part of their backbone, and this reflected use of pertuzumab as standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting in other jurisdictions. The Committee considered given the use of neoadjuvant pertuzumab as standard of care in many other countries, that it was unlikely additional evidence would become available for this indication. </p><p><br></p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pertuzumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000R5FAL&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002lD5J\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
