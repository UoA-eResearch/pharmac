The Subcommittee noted that intravenous indigo carmine, methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue), or fluorescein are used in this setting, and that indigo carmine is not an approved product and that fluorescein is used off-label for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently available treatments are administered intravenously and pose a higher risk of adverse events such as anaphylaxis, which requires monitoring post-administration.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the applicant proposed that 400 mg riboflavin would be taken orally the night before surgery to colour the urine, for improved visualisation of vesicoureteric anatomy. The Subcommittee noted that, as an endogenous vitamin, oral riboflavin does not pose the same level of risk compared with other coloured intravenous agents. The Subcommittee also noted that there is evidence of riboflavin being used for this purpose in the following studies:</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30633139/\" target=\"_blank\">Stitely et al. Obstet Gynecol. 2019;133:301-7</a>: a randomised controlled trial of patients scheduled for gynaecologic surgery where cystoscopy was a planned component of the procedure who were given 400 mg of riboflavin versus placebo the night before surgery. Patients had significantly increased coloured urine, ureteral jets were more easily visualised, and that bilateral ureteric patency was confirmed in 30 of 33 women (91%) in the riboflavin group and in 28 of 33 women (85%) in the placebo group (P=0.71).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21472446/\" target=\"_blank\">Fernando et al. Int Urogynexol J. 2011;22:947-51</a>: an observational study of women booked to receive cystoscopy as main procedure or were likely to require one as an adjunct to vaginal surgery who were given three vitamin B complex tablets 1-4 hours prior to cystoscopy (total 45 mg riboflavin). 72.1% participants had yellow-coloured urine and indigo carmine was only used twice (2.9%); one of which was due to clinician preference.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the applicant also provided a case report study of an individual who had anaphylactic shock after administration of intravenous sodium fluorescein for the assessment of ureteral efflux <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29528930/\" target=\"_blank\">(Lee et al. Obstet Gynecol. 2018;131:727-9).</a></p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the number of patients who might require riboflavin for assessment of ureteric patency during cystoscopy was unknown and considered that funding riboflavin would result in its use in a minority of procedures and would not lead to a significant uptake by clinicians. The Subcommittee considered that from a gynaecological perspective the majority of patients undergoing cystoscopy would require visualisation as a part of their procedure. Members were not aware if this proportion differed substantially in urology practice. The Subcommittee considered that including patients undergoing cystoscopy or hysterectomy would give the largest possible potential patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that using riboflavin for this purpose would reduce the requirement for intravenous administration of agents and thus reduce the risk of anaphylactic reactions. While this might reduce the requirement for monitoring for the latter, it was noted that, as patients are routinely monitored perioperatively regardless of agent used, this would not impact hugely on clinician time. The Subcommittee also considered that careful planning would be needed to provide patients with the riboflavin in advance of cystoscopy, as they would take it at home, the night before the procedure. However, because patients undergo some form of preadmission process prior to these procedures, this should not pose a barrier to its use</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for riboflavin if it were to be funded in New Zealand for perioperative use for cystoscopy. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000007Jz55&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001sGvv\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
