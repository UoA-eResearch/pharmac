When we do so, we carefully evaluate clinical and other evidence for the benefits and suitability of a proposal, and to identify and understand the people who will be affected by it.</p>\r\n<p>While our main task is to allocate pharmaceutical funding, we consider the benefits and costs across the whole health system now and with a long-term focus, including the effects for hospitals and primary care, and consider direct costs to patients as well as to all health sector budgets.</p>\r\n<p>Final funding decisions are made by the Pharmac Board or delegated to senior Pharmac staff as required by the Board.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
