The Subcommittee noted that the care and management of women with recurrent miscarriage is within the scope of all gynaecology departments, however that access to secondary care can have barriers and often treatment occurs in primary care. The Subcommittee noted that while weekly ultrasound scanning from 6 \u2013 12 weeks gestation has been shown to improve live birth rates, it is not commonly employed in New Zealand due to resource constraints.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application specified that progesterone treatment would be initiated from the first time of episode of bleeding (following confirmation that pregnancy location was intrauterine, viable and ongoing) and stopped at 16 weeks gestation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a full secretory endometrium and in particular gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects. The Subcommittee also noted that progesterone is not currently Medsafe approved for recurring pregnancy loss and is currently only approved for adjunctive use with an oestrogen in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus (for hormone replacement therapy). The Subcommittee noted that the proposed dosing regimen for progesterone for recurrent early pregnancy loss is 400 mg progesterone being inserted into the vagina (or rectum if preferred) twice daily. The Subcommittee considered that it would be preferable if a higher dose capsule were available, noting the requirement for multiple capsules to be administered every day, however acknowledged that no higher dose capsules were currently approved in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following evidence in relation to the use of progesterone in recurrent early miscarriage:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558710/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK558710.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Coomarasamy et al.

The live birth rate was 75% in the progesterone group and 72% in the placebo group (relative rate (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.07; p = 0.08). Subgroup analysis by previous number of miscarriages showed that for women with three or more prior miscarriages, 72% in the progesterone group had live births, compared to 57% in the placebo group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.51; p = 0.004).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK362732/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK362732.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Coomarasamy et al.

Treatment of miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment probably reduces the risk of miscarriage; (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.87; 7 trials; 696 women; moderate-quality evidence). Treatment with oral progestogen compared to no treatment also probably reduces the miscarriage rate (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.85; 3 trials; 408 women; moderate-quality evidence). However, treatment with vaginal progesterone compared to placebo, probably has little or no effect in reducing the miscarriage rate (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.21; 4 trials; 288 women; moderate-quality evidence).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee were also made aware of the following additional information relating to progesterone and progestogens for early recurrent pregnancy loss:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003511.pub5/epdf/full\" target=\"_blank\">Haas et al.

The evidence suggests that there may be a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo/controls (average risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.00, 10 trials, 1684 women, moderate\u2010quality evidence). There was potentially a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen seen in the outcome of live birth rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13, 6 trials, 1411 women, moderate\u2010quality evidence), but there was uncertainty about the effect on the rate of preterm birth because the evidence was very low\u2010quality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.41, 4 trials, 256 women, very low\u2010quality evidence).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is no evidence to suggest that progesterone for the treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss causes any short term or long term adverse effects for the mother or baby.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the strength and quality of evidence was moderate; but considered that the nature of the indication means that better quality data will likely never be available. Members considered that the majority of data for most pregnancy related care is of a lower quality because higher quality evidence, such as randomised controlled trials, is not and will never be undertaken in this population group. The Subcommittee considered that it is therefore unrealistic to expect further randomised controlled data for indications such as recurrent pregnancy loss, and that not widening access to progesterone based on the quality of the data available would be inappropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that miscarriage care is mainly given in the primary healthcare setting, and that if access is widened to progesterone it should be available for primary healthcare providers, including midwives, to prescribe.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that any benefits from progesterone would be highly impactful for parents and wh\u0101nau experiencing recurrent early pregnancy loss, particularly for improved mental and social health. The Subcommittee considered that the access criteria should be the same as the entry criteria for the PRISM trial (i.e. previously experienced three or more miscarriages, has experienced bleeding in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). The Subcommittee also considered that if a patient was prescribed progesterone while pregnant and did not experience a miscarriage, that clinicians would likely to prefer to prescribe progesterone again before any incidence of bleeding in any subsequent pregnancies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered it would be reasonable to assume that progesterone would be initiated around week six of gestation. The Subcommittee considered that treating patients up to 16 weeks of gestation may be longer than necessary but were unsure of the optimal treatment duration.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that currently there are limited options for people experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss in New Zealand and that widening access to progesterone for recurrent early pregnancy loss would improve the standard of care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for progesterone if it were to be funded in New Zealand for recurrent early pregnancy loss. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that recurrent early pregnancy loss/ miscarriage is historically defined as the loss of three of more clinically recognised pregnancies by the same partner, in the first 12 weeks of gestation. The Subcommittee noted that approximately 15% of clinically recognised pregnancies will miscarry, and that about 25% of women will have at least one miscarriage in their lifetime, with 0.4 -1.0% of women experiencing recurrent miscarriage.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that miscarriage causes significant emotional distress for the parents, families and wh\u0101nau, and also noted that there is no clear data about ethnic differences in miscarriage rates in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that the care and management of women with recurrent miscarriage is within the scope of all gynaecology departments, however that access to secondary care can have barriers and often treatment occurs in primary care. The Subcommittee noted that while weekly ultrasound scanning from 6 \u2013 12 weeks gestation has been shown to improve live birth rates, it is not commonly employed in New Zealand due to resource constraints.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application specified that progesterone treatment would be initiated from the first time of episode of bleeding (following confirmation that pregnancy location was intrauterine, viable and ongoing) and stopped at 16 weeks gestation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a full secretory endometrium and in particular gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects. The Subcommittee also noted that progesterone is not currently Medsafe approved for recurring pregnancy loss and is currently only approved for adjunctive use with an oestrogen in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus (for hormone replacement therapy). The Subcommittee noted that the proposed dosing regimen for progesterone for recurrent early pregnancy loss is 400 mg progesterone being inserted into the vagina (or rectum if preferred) twice daily. The Subcommittee considered that it would be preferable if a higher dose capsule were available, noting the requirement for multiple capsules to be administered every day, however acknowledged that no higher dose capsules were currently approved in New Zealand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following evidence in relation to the use of progesterone in recurrent early miscarriage:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558710/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK558710.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Coomarasamy et al.
