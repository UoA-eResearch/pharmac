The Committee noted that there is limited evidence on the prevalence of moderate to severe psoriasis in the Māori population. The Committee noted a 2014 letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal reported that Māori and Pacific peoples were overrepresented in the numbers treated for psoriasis in the Auckland District Health Board (ADHB) over the last 5 years (2009–2014) (<a href=""https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/ethnicity-of-psoriasis-patients-an-auckland-perspective"" target=""_blank"">Lee and Lamb, N Z Med J. 2014;127:73-4</a>). The Committee noted that as many Māori experience greater barriers to accessing the appropriate healthcare and treatments in comparison with European individuals and therefore considered there may be greater unmet health need for Māori individuals with plaque psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background </em></p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that it had previously reviewed an application in 2021 for risankizumab an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibiting biologic medicine. At the time this was recommended by the Dermatology Advisory Committee for listing on the Pharmaceutical Schedule with a high priority for both the first- and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">second-line</a>s of treatment. The application for risankizumab was thereafter reviewed by PTAC in 2021 and was recommended for listing with a <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008puXW/p001180"" target=""_blank"">medium priority for first-line</a> and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">high priority for second-line</a> treatment. The Committee noted that as risankizumab and guselkumab both target the P19 subunit of IL-23, when considering the application for guselkumab, other currently unfunded biologics, namely, risankizumab and ustekinumab would also be discussed.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that chronic plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 80-90%). The Subcommittee noted that approximately 2% of the New Zealand population are affected, but that the majority of individuals have clinically mild psoriasis which is not extensive enough to warrant treatment with biologics.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the interleukin 23 (IL-23) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway is pivotal in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-23 is a key regulator of IL-17 secretion.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently four biologic treatments, in two classes, funded for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in New Zealand: the three tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and an IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab. The Committee considered that, although funded for this indication, infliximab is not the drug of choice for most clinicians as it requires a day stay infusion centre and incurs a significant cost in time and money to both the individual receiving treatment and the health sector. The Committee also considered that etanercept is less commonly used than adalimumab, as it is less efficacious than the other funded biologic agents and it requires weekly administration.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are no funded IL-23 inhibitors available for the treatment of psoriasis and noted that the Pharmaceutical Schedule currently lists ‘second-generation’ biologics namely, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and secukinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The Committee noted that Guselkumab is a third-generation biologic and considered to be associated with greater clinical efficacy for plaque psoriasis, which is sustained for greater periods of time, compared with the duration of second-generation biologics therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that 30-60% of people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were using biologics had discontinued treatment at 75 months due to loss of efficacy, with secukinumab having the lowest drug-survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094341/"" target=""_blank"">Egeberg et al. Br J Dermatol. 2018; 178:509-519</a>). The Committee note the waning of therapeutic efficacy over time is a significant concern for individuals and clinicians. The Committee noted that if an individual has not received adequate health benefit from adalimumab, then they will change therapies and receive secukinumab, however, if this therapy does not provide individuals with significant relief from symptoms the clinician is limited to providing only best compassionate and supportive care for these individuals. The Committee noted that access to a funded third-generation biologic like guselkumab or risankizumab is needed in New Zealand to address this unmet health need.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is still a disproportionate impact of psoriasis on individuals who are not receiving adequate health benefit from the current biologic therapies. The Committee noted that psoriasis has a profound psychosocial effect, with individuals suffering from depression and anxiety. The Committee noted that plaque psoriasis is associated with levels of impairment leading to an inability to work, and that regaining the ability to work is an important outcome for affected individuals.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody that binds with high-affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of IL-23. This binding prevents the interaction of IL-23 with its corresponding receptor on the surface of the immune cell. This action is responsible for blocking the initiation of the IL-23 pathway and the subsequent release of other proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the renewal criteria for biologics in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis defines a sufficient response to treatment as a reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) rate response of 75% from baseline (PASI 75). The Committee considered that a PASI 75 response is now an older measure of success to treatment and improvements in therapeutics and protocols have resulted in PASI 90 rate response being considered to be a more significant goal for clinicians and the individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Committee noted that while a PASI score is clinically important, there is greater focus by clinicians in determining the health benefit of a treatment using the Dermatology life quality index (DLQI) in which provides clinicians with an understanding of the individual’s experience with psoriasis before and after treatment.\xa0</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following studies demonstrating the health benefits of guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057360/"" target=""_blank"">Blauvelt et al.

The Committee noted that guselkumab and risankizumab have the same mechanism of action and noted the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of both guselkumab and risankizumab to be equivalent. The Committee noted that either of these two pharmaceuticals would provide significant health benefit to individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in both first- and second-line treatment.

While other biologics can also be administered subcutaneously, including etanercept, adalimumab and secukinumab, as these are administered at a higher frequency than guselkumab (once weekly, fortnightly, and monthly respectively), the latter would lower the number of injections an individual must receive or undertake.

The Committee considered that if guselkumab were available in a first line setting, that the majority of patients would start on it due to the strong evidence of benefit. The Committee considered that there may be slight differences in frequency of administration between guselkumab and risankizumab that may impact uptake if both were to be funded.

The Committee noted that there is limited evidence on the prevalence of moderate to severe psoriasis in the Māori population. The Committee noted a 2014 letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal reported that Māori and Pacific peoples were overrepresented in the numbers treated for psoriasis in the Auckland District Health Board (ADHB) over the last 5 years (2009–2014) (<a href=""https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/ethnicity-of-psoriasis-patients-an-auckland-perspective"" target=""_blank"">Lee and Lamb, N Z Med J. 2014;127:73-4</a>). The Committee noted that as many Māori experience greater barriers to accessing the appropriate healthcare and treatments in comparison with European individuals and therefore considered there may be greater unmet health need for Māori individuals with plaque psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background </em></p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that it had previously reviewed an application in 2021 for risankizumab an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibiting biologic medicine. At the time this was recommended by the Dermatology Advisory Committee for listing on the Pharmaceutical Schedule with a high priority for both the first- and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">second-line</a>s of treatment. The application for risankizumab was thereafter reviewed by PTAC in 2021 and was recommended for listing with a <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008puXW/p001180"" target=""_blank"">medium priority for first-line</a> and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">high priority for second-line</a> treatment. The Committee noted that as risankizumab and guselkumab both target the P19 subunit of IL-23, when considering the application for guselkumab, other currently unfunded biologics, namely, risankizumab and ustekinumab would also be discussed.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that chronic plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 80-90%). The Subcommittee noted that approximately 2% of the New Zealand population are affected, but that the majority of individuals have clinically mild psoriasis which is not extensive enough to warrant treatment with biologics.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the interleukin 23 (IL-23) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway is pivotal in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-23 is a key regulator of IL-17 secretion.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently four biologic treatments, in two classes, funded for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in New Zealand: the three tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and an IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab. The Committee considered that, although funded for this indication, infliximab is not the drug of choice for most clinicians as it requires a day stay infusion centre and incurs a significant cost in time and money to both the individual receiving treatment and the health sector. The Committee also considered that etanercept is less commonly used than adalimumab, as it is less efficacious than the other funded biologic agents and it requires weekly administration.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are no funded IL-23 inhibitors available for the treatment of psoriasis and noted that the Pharmaceutical Schedule currently lists ‘second-generation’ biologics namely, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and secukinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The Committee noted that Guselkumab is a third-generation biologic and considered to be associated with greater clinical efficacy for plaque psoriasis, which is sustained for greater periods of time, compared with the duration of second-generation biologics therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that 30-60% of people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were using biologics had discontinued treatment at 75 months due to loss of efficacy, with secukinumab having the lowest drug-survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094341/"" target=""_blank"">Egeberg et al. Br J Dermatol. 2018; 178:509-519</a>). The Committee note the waning of therapeutic efficacy over time is a significant concern for individuals and clinicians. The Committee noted that if an individual has not received adequate health benefit from adalimumab, then they will change therapies and receive secukinumab, however, if this therapy does not provide individuals with significant relief from symptoms the clinician is limited to providing only best compassionate and supportive care for these individuals. The Committee noted that access to a funded third-generation biologic like guselkumab or risankizumab is needed in New Zealand to address this unmet health need.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is still a disproportionate impact of psoriasis on individuals who are not receiving adequate health benefit from the current biologic therapies. The Committee noted that psoriasis has a profound psychosocial effect, with individuals suffering from depression and anxiety. The Committee noted that plaque psoriasis is associated with levels of impairment leading to an inability to work, and that regaining the ability to work is an important outcome for affected individuals.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody that binds with high-affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of IL-23. This binding prevents the interaction of IL-23 with its corresponding receptor on the surface of the immune cell. This action is responsible for blocking the initiation of the IL-23 pathway and the subsequent release of other proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the renewal criteria for biologics in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis defines a sufficient response to treatment as a reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) rate response of 75% from baseline (PASI 75). The Committee considered that a PASI 75 response is now an older measure of success to treatment and improvements in therapeutics and protocols have resulted in PASI 90 rate response being considered to be a more significant goal for clinicians and the individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Committee noted that while a PASI score is clinically important, there is greater focus by clinicians in determining the health benefit of a treatment using the Dermatology life quality index (DLQI) in which provides clinicians with an understanding of the individual’s experience with psoriasis before and after treatment.\xa0</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following studies demonstrating the health benefits of guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057360/"" target=""_blank"">Blauvelt et al.

The Committee noted that there is limited evidence on the prevalence of moderate to severe psoriasis in the Māori population. The Committee noted a 2014 letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal reported that Māori and Pacific peoples were overrepresented in the numbers treated for psoriasis in the Auckland District Health Board (ADHB) over the last 5 years (2009–2014) (<a href=""https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/ethnicity-of-psoriasis-patients-an-auckland-perspective"" target=""_blank"">Lee and Lamb, N Z Med J. 2014;127:73-4</a>). The Committee noted that as many Māori experience greater barriers to accessing the appropriate healthcare and treatments in comparison with European individuals and therefore considered there may be greater unmet health need for Māori individuals with plaque psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background </em></p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that it had previously reviewed an application in 2021 for risankizumab an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibiting biologic medicine. At the time this was recommended by the Dermatology Advisory Committee for listing on the Pharmaceutical Schedule with a high priority for both the first- and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">second-line</a>s of treatment. The application for risankizumab was thereafter reviewed by PTAC in 2021 and was recommended for listing with a <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008puXW/p001180"" target=""_blank"">medium priority for first-line</a> and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000UBGQUA4/risankizumab"" target=""_blank"">high priority for second-line</a> treatment. The Committee noted that as risankizumab and guselkumab both target the P19 subunit of IL-23, when considering the application for guselkumab, other currently unfunded biologics, namely, risankizumab and ustekinumab would also be discussed.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that chronic plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 80-90%). The Subcommittee noted that approximately 2% of the New Zealand population are affected, but that the majority of individuals have clinically mild psoriasis which is not extensive enough to warrant treatment with biologics.</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the interleukin 23 (IL-23) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway is pivotal in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-23 is a key regulator of IL-17 secretion.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are currently four biologic treatments, in two classes, funded for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in New Zealand: the three tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and an IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab. The Committee considered that, although funded for this indication, infliximab is not the drug of choice for most clinicians as it requires a day stay infusion centre and incurs a significant cost in time and money to both the individual receiving treatment and the health sector. The Committee also considered that etanercept is less commonly used than adalimumab, as it is less efficacious than the other funded biologic agents and it requires weekly administration.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there are no funded IL-23 inhibitors available for the treatment of psoriasis and noted that the Pharmaceutical Schedule currently lists ‘second-generation’ biologics namely, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and secukinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The Committee noted that Guselkumab is a third-generation biologic and considered to be associated with greater clinical efficacy for plaque psoriasis, which is sustained for greater periods of time, compared with the duration of second-generation biologics therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that 30-60% of people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were using biologics had discontinued treatment at 75 months due to loss of efficacy, with secukinumab having the lowest drug-survival (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094341/"" target=""_blank"">Egeberg et al. Br J Dermatol. 2018; 178:509-519</a>). The Committee note the waning of therapeutic efficacy over time is a significant concern for individuals and clinicians. The Committee noted that if an individual has not received adequate health benefit from adalimumab, then they will change therapies and receive secukinumab, however, if this therapy does not provide individuals with significant relief from symptoms the clinician is limited to providing only best compassionate and supportive care for these individuals. The Committee noted that access to a funded third-generation biologic like guselkumab or risankizumab is needed in New Zealand to address this unmet health need.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is still a disproportionate impact of psoriasis on individuals who are not receiving adequate health benefit from the current biologic therapies. The Committee noted that psoriasis has a profound psychosocial effect, with individuals suffering from depression and anxiety. The Committee noted that plaque psoriasis is associated with levels of impairment leading to an inability to work, and that regaining the ability to work is an important outcome for affected individuals.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody that binds with high-affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of IL-23. This binding prevents the interaction of IL-23 with its corresponding receptor on the surface of the immune cell. This action is responsible for blocking the initiation of the IL-23 pathway and the subsequent release of other proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the renewal criteria for biologics in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis defines a sufficient response to treatment as a reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) rate response of 75% from baseline (PASI 75). The Committee considered that a PASI 75 response is now an older measure of success to treatment and improvements in therapeutics and protocols have resulted in PASI 90 rate response being considered to be a more significant goal for clinicians and the individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Committee noted that while a PASI score is clinically important, there is greater focus by clinicians in determining the health benefit of a treatment using the Dermatology life quality index (DLQI) in which provides clinicians with an understanding of the individual’s experience with psoriasis before and after treatment.\xa0</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following studies demonstrating the health benefits of guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28057360/"" target=""_blank"">Blauvelt et al.

The Committee considered guselkumab clinical trials to have produced high quality data with a clear benefit which would also be experienced by individuals with plaque psoriasis in New Zealand. The Committee noted that in regard to the observed PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses guselkumab has superior therapeutic effects to the currently available biologic treatments for plaque psoriasis on the pharmaceutical schedule for plaque psoriasis and considered there to be a significant unmet health need that guselkumab would address.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis study comparing efficacy and safety of biologics used in the treatment of plaque psoriasis.

The Committee considered that the evidence appears to suggest guselkumab and risankizumab have improved long-term drug survival compared to the currently funded biologics for psoriasis. The Committee noted that guselkumab and risankizumab have the same mechanism of action and noted the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of both guselkumab and risankizumab to be equivalent. The Committee noted that either of these two pharmaceuticals would provide significant health benefit to individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in both first- and second-line treatment. The Committee noted that if either option was listed guselkumab or risankizumab would likely become the preferred first-line option for treatment for individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Suitability</em></p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that guselkumab is administered as a subcutaneous injection, the supplier indicates a person could self-inject following appropriate training by a healthcare professional. The recommended dose of guselkumab for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is 100mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, and thereafter every 8 weeks. While other biologics can also be administered subcutaneously, including etanercept, adalimumab and secukinumab, as these are administered at a higher frequency than guselkumab (once weekly, fortnightly, and monthly respectively), the latter would lower the number of injections an individual must receive or undertake.

The Committee considered that uptake of guselkumab would likely be similar to uptake of risankizumab should either be funded, due to the similar efficacy between the two. The Committee considered that if guselkumab were available in a first line setting, that the majority of patients would start on it due to the strong evidence of benefit. The Committee considered that there may be slight differences in frequency of administration between guselkumab and risankizumab that may impact uptake if both were to be funded. The Committee also considered that the evidence supported a superior efficacy for both guselkumab and risankizumab compared to ustekinumab for plaque psoriasis.
