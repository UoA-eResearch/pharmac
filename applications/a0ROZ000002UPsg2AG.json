          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that the health need of people with ovarian cancer, including ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer that is platinum-sensitive (ie disease progression has occurred 6 months or more after the end of chemotherapy) has been previously described, most recently by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PTAC-record-2020-08-published-28-October-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC in August 2020</a> and by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-15-Catsop-Record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP in February 2021</a> in relation to an application for the polyadenosine 5\u2019-diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib. The Subcommittee noted that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008pufS/p001369\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib is currently funded for the second-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer with germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA) only, and that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P00000AHK3i/p001558\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib has been considered for first-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive BRCAm ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that about 80% of patients with ovarian cancer who receive first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy are platinum-sensitive, and considered that this sensitivity correlates with a response to a PARP inhibitor such as olaparib or niraparib.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that homologous recombination is a biological process that occurs as part of multistrand DNA repair and that the presence of identifiable errors in this repair process are described as homologous repair deficiency (HRD). The Subcommittee noted that well-known examples of HRD are mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (BRCAm) which can occur either in the germline (gBRCA) as hereditary mutations occurring in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer, or as somatic mutations (sBRCA) that arise within a tumour in about 6% of ovarian cancer cases. The Subcommittee considered that platinum-sensitive disease, in which platinum-induced single-strand DNA breaks are not amended, also has deficiency in this repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that other types of HRD occur in roughly 20% of ovarian cancers and that the population without HRD, including those without BRCAm (ie those who are HR proficient), account for 38-50% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan. ESMO Open. 2021;6:100144</a>; <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.1586\" target=\"_blank\">Timms et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38(15_suppl):1586</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with gBRCA ovarian cancer are generally diagnosed at a younger age than those ovarian cancer patients without a BRCAm, have an increased risk of other malignancies and may experience added anxiety about mutation inheritance, although members identified no evidence to inform whether there are quality of life or survival differences between ovarian cancer patients with gBRCA and those without gBRCA. In addition, members considered that there is currently no evidence to inform whether there are any quality of life or survival differences between sBRCA, HRD and HR proficient patients with ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is emerging evidence of a poorly defined population with BRCA-like phenotype where their disease behaves like BRCAm, possibly resulting from non-BRCA gene mutations or other complex changes (ie epigenetics) affecting the HR repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that this may occur in between 10-22% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan. 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.1586\" target=\"_blank\">Timms et al. 2020</a>) and that there are multiple approaches seek to objectively and prospectively define this population such as functional tests (eg RAD51), mutation profiling for indicative mutations (eg signature3 or HRDetect), and genomic instability tests (ie germline damage indicating poor HR), although each of these tests has varied and challenging requirements.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current tests used internationally for diagnosis of genomic instability (ie HRD) include the FoundationOne CDx (Foundation Medicine) and myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) although it is unclear which should be preferred due to biased data and self-chosen thresholds. The Subcommittee noted that these two tests have reasonable agreement in outcomes and high agreement on HR proficient results, although these tests will not capture the proportion of patients with BRCA-like phenotype of epigenetic cause. The Subcommittee noted that neither of these tests are used in New Zealand outside of clinical trials or private testing and that unverified, nominal estimates of these costs could range from $2,000-5,000 per test.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the sensitivity of the current BRCAm test is high due to the quality of the reference data but noted that there is less data available for other types of HRD. The Subcommittee considered that the BRCAm reference population data is predominantly from Caucasian patients and therefore its applicability to various other ethnic groups may overestimate population-level benefits of treatment in those other groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is an oral treatment that targets PARP-1 and PARP-2, and that the mechanism by which PARP inhibitors facilitate cancer cell death has been described previously. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is being assessed under <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/cancer-medicine-funding-parallel-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmac\u2019s cancer medicines parallel assessment process</a>, as it was submitted to Medsafe in November 2020 for the following indications:</p><ul><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy</li><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>monotherapy maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that many PARP inhibitors are either under assessment or approved internationally and in most cases, were initially considered or approved for the targeted population with BRCAm disease however these medicines are being targeted at a broader population over time. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib was recommended for funding for first-line maintenance and for second-line maintenance in Canada (CADTH), Scotland (SMC), England &amp; Wales (NICE; within Cancer Drugs Fund); although in all cases, improvement of cost-effectiveness was required.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Niraparib first-line maintenance</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from PRIMA, a multi-centre phase III randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 733 adult patients with newly diagnosed stage III/IV high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer who had complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, irrespective of HRD status (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1910962?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00edn et al. N Engl J Med. 2019;381:2391-2402</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib or placebo once daily within 12 weeks after completion of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy starting with a fixed dose of 300 mg with the trial protocol subsequently amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of 200 mg for patients with a baseline body weight of less than 77 kg, a platelet count of less than 150,000 per mm3, or both. The Subcommittee noted that treatment continued for 28-day cycles for 36 months or until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were balanced between groups, the trial was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome, and that participants were stratified appropriately according to their response to first-line chemotherapy, use of neoadjuvant therapy and HRD status. The Subcommittee noted that HRD was defined as the presence of a BRCA deleterious mutation, a score of at least 42 on the myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) test, or both. The Subcommittee noted that the myChoice test used a combined score of 0-100 with a cutpoint of 42 used to report HRD as positive or negative and that it was assumed that 50% of participants had HRD. The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA included both germline and somatic BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA used both RECIST and CA125 to define disease progression with histologic progression or clinical symptoms and considered this was a slightly different and more sensitive threshold than that used in other ovarian cancer literature. The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of</p><p><br></p><p>13.8 months, median progression-free survival (PFS), tested hierarchically, in the HRD population was 21.9 months with niraparib compared with 10.4 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.59; p&lt;0.001) and in the overall population was 13.8 months with niraparib compared with 8.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival data was immature at the interim analysis with 10.8% of deaths having occurred in the overall population. The Subcommittee noted 177 patients were still on treatment at data cut-off and therefore considered it likely that some continued beyond two years of treatment, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to indicate an appropriate duration of treatment for patients in response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses of PFS hazard ratios suggested there was greatest benefit from niraparib in the BRCAm population, a lesser benefit in non-BRCA HRD, and the least benefit in the HR proficient population. The Subcommittee noted that the greatest reported differences in PFS between niraparib and placebo were seen in the non-BRCAm HRD group (11.4 months) and BRCAm only (11.2 months), compared with HR proficient group (2.7 months) although the study was not powered to determine the size of effect in the latter population, therefore it was unclear if a significant benefit occurred in the HR proficient group. However, the Subcommittee noted that stratification imbalances were not correctly accounted for in the Cox regression analyses and considered that the HRD population drove the overall benefit, therefore the actual effect size was uncertain in each group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the PRIMA study design limited its ability to detect the significance of a PFS benefit in the HR proficient group and the trial did not enrol participants from Pacific regions therefore it does not provide efficacy data in Asian populations, in particular, who are more susceptible to metabolic faults in carboxylesterase 1 that may affect PARP inhibitor metabolism and treatment response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, overall, this single high-quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial provides evidence of a PFS benefit from niraparib first-line maintenance compared with current standard of care (observation) in the overall trial population, driven by a greater benefit in the HRD population (which included patients with germline and somatic BRCAm). The Subcommittee noted that niraparib first-line maintenance was associated with some toxicities, considered it would be associated with increased clinic requirements, but noted it was not associated with a decrement in quality of life.</p><h1><i>Niraparib second-line maintenance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i></h1><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from NOVA, a phase III randomised (2:1) double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 533 adult patients with platinum-sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to their last line of platinum-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:2154-64</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib 300 mg or placebo once daily commencing no later than 8 weeks after completing their last dose of platinum-based therapy for 28-day cycles until disease progression, and that dose reductions to 200 mg or 100 mg were permitted in cases of toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were generally balanced between groups except prior receipt of \u22653 lines of chemotherapy which was reported in about half of gBRCA patients and about one-third of non-gBRCA patients, and roughly 10-15% of non-gBRCA patients received less prior chemotherapy than gBRCA patients. The Subcommittee considered this may impact the assessment of benefit in non-gBRCA compared with gBRCA populations from NOVA. The Subcommittee noted that the trial grouped patients as either gBRCA or non-gBRCA, the latter of which contained the HRD subgroup.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA enrolled patients with gBRCA and sBRCA but participants were not stratified by this status. The Subcommittee noted that patients were stratified by time to progression, use of bevacizumab in prior chemotherapy line (which occurred in about 30%), and response to prior chemotherapy line. The Subcommittee considered that the trial criteria selected for a BRCA-like phenotype. The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc testing of HRD using the myChoice CDx would have grouped patients with sBRCA as HRD rather than as BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that NOVA was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome of PFS using RECIST criteria (NOVA did not allow CA125 in its definition of progression). The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of 16.9 months, median PFS in patients with gBRCA was 21.0 months with niraparib compared with 5.5 months with placebo (difference of 15.5 months, HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.41); median PFS in the non-gBRCA HRD subgroup was 12.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59); and median PFS in the non-gBRCA group was 9.3 months with niraparib compared with\u00a03.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61, p&lt;0.001 in all three primary efficacy populations). The Subcommittee considered that these PFS benefits of even five months\u2019 improvement or longer and, by extrapolation, possibly survival benefits were clinically significant, noting that the time not on chemotherapy is important for this patient population in terms of quality of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the exploratory median PFS in the HR proficient subgroup was 6.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (difference of 3.1 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; p=0.02).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of outcomes according to whether patients had received two vs more than two prior lines of chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al. 2016</a>). The Subcommittee considered it was unclear whether there is a difference in effect for patients with gBRCA who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving better effect than in those with gBRCA who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy) and patients with non-BRCA HRD who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving a lesser effect than those with non-BRCA HRD who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy). The Subcommittee considered the post-hoc results did not align with biological rationales, as patients with non-BRCA HRD are generally quite well and are considered a chemotherapy-sensitive population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from a conference presentation reporting substantial drop-out in NOVA with 155/553 (28%) of patients discontinuing the study for reasons other than death, resulting in arm imbalances between arms and reduced availability of survival data availability (<a href=\"https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(21)00693-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Matulonis et al. [presentation notes]. Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women\u2019s Cancer (virtual): 2021 March 19-25</a>). The Subcommittee noted that subsequent treatment data and therefore crossover rates were missing for the discontinued population. The Subcommittee noted that imputed and estimated data, adjusted for subsequent PARP inhibitor use, was used to generate an adjusted overall survival estimate in the context of substantial missing data. The Subcommittee considered that there is a possibility of an overall survival (OS) benefit in the gBRCA population but, as the analysis was based on a small sample with several steps, this could not accurately indicate the magnitude of any OS effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA did not include low-grade serous or non-serous histology therefore potential benefits in those populations are unknown. The Subcommittee considered that NOVA provided evidence that niraparib second-line maintenance is associated with a PFS benefit for the overall trial population, with the greatest benefit seen in the gBRCAm population followed by the non-gBRCA HRD population. The Subcommittee considered that less benefit was seen in the non-BRCAm population which comprises both HRD (non-BRCAm) and HR-proficient patients, therefore the evidence cannot confirm the magnitude of any benefit for HR-proficient patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(18)30333-4\" target=\"_blank\">Oza et al.

However, the Subcommittee considered that niraparib second-line could offer a PFS benefit to patients with sBRCA or HRD and possibly a lesser benefit to patients who are HR-proficient, although accompanied by toxicity compared with observation alone.</p><p><br></p><p><i>General</i></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that toxicity with niraparib was similar between treatment lines, and that a wide range of any-grade toxicities were associated with niraparib compared with placebo. The Subcommittee noted that quality of life (QOL) data indicates some toxicity, however, the QOL between patients who received niraparib and those who received placebo was the same. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence could be interpreted as there being no adverse impact on QOL with niraparib despite additional toxicities and clinic visits with niraparib and as part of a clinical trial, compared with usual care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the magnitude of benefit from niraparib on the HR proficient ovarian cancer population remains unclear.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the available evidence supports the use of one PARP inhibitor in a patient\u2019s treatment journey for ovarian cancer, <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">either as a first-line maintenance therapy or as second-line maintenance</span>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the data suggests there may be a class effect among PARP inhibitors for first-line maintenance (ie olaparib, niraparib, veliparib) or second-line maintenance treatment (ie olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) for ovarian cancer in terms of PFS, however, the clinical trial populations for these medicines differ in their definitions due to use of different companion diagnostics. The Subcommittee noted that olaparib has not been validated with HRD tests and considered it was uncertain whether the HRD results from niraparib trials could be applied to treatment with olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that the benefits from PARP inhibitors appear greatest in BRCAm disease with lesser benefit in a broader general ovarian cancer population however more thorough review would inform assessment of a class effect of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and what benefits may be expected in which clinical patient populations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently there is heavy demand on BRCA testing in New Zealand and that there can be significant delays in gaining timely access to genetic counsellors. The Subcommittee considered that funding a PARP inhibitor regardless of BRCA mutation status would potentially reduce the BRCA testing demand, although many clinicians would still test given potential familial implications. The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would increase clinical resource use to some extent for the existing population with ovarian cancer (eg genetic testing, monthly blood tests and medical oncology clinic visits, and repeated CT imaging perhaps twice during maintenance treatment).\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a similar magnitude of health system impact would occur whether funded for first-line or second-line maintenance, although patients may have a longer duration on maintenance treatment in the first-line setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that HRD testing is costly but quick to interpret given the yes/no result of the Myriad diagnostic. The Subcommittee noted that HRD testing is currently not available in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that, if niraparib were funded for somatic BRCAm, this could result in patients seeking a new test of a tumour tissue sample requiring a separate process involving a biopsy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the FoundationOne HRD test is validated only for rucaparib and that olaparib is not validated with any HRD tests, therefore would not be appropriate to test for HRD and treat with olaparib based on HRD results.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, whilst evidence of benefit was limited in the HR proficient population, funding niraparib for the wider ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutational status (ie an \u2018all comers\u2019 population) would enable access to a PARP inhibitor without the requirement for mutational testing. The Subcommittee considered that funding niraparib without requiring mutational testing may have a benefit for those unable to access costly mutational testing and reduce the health system impact from additional testing in the ovarian cancer patient population. The Subcommittee acknowledged the overall benefit in an \u2018all comers\u2019 population would be driven by the BRCAm/HRD population groups, noting HR proficient patient populations in the first-line are expected to have PFS of approximately 2 months. The Subcommittee considered that for these HR proficient patients, the short period of time until treatment progression would likely result in a shortened treatment period and recommended Pharmac undertake analysis to understand the cost of this compared with the costs associated with treating the \u2018all comers\u2019 patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would not be used in combination with any other anticancer medicines nor would it replace any anticancer medicines although members noted that combination treatment is being investigated in clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered that first-line maintenance with niraparib would provide an additional maintenance treatment option within a line of therapy, and that second-line maintenance irrespective of mutation status would provide an additional option for patients without gBRCA, as those with gBRCA could access olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that if more than one PARP inhibitor were funded, patients may choose to start treatment with either in a random fashion and that switching from one PARP inhibitor to another would be unlikely unless a patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity with one PARP inhibitor.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30 patients with gBRCA and sBRCA may be eligible for niraparib first-line maintenance per year, and that only patients with gBRCA would be eligible for second-line maintenance. The Subcommittee considered that funding the population with ovarian cancer irrespective of mutation status would result in much higher eligible patient numbers. The Subcommittee considered that a small prevalent pool may occur in both the first-line and second-line due to the timeframe to commence PARP inhibitor treatment post-chemotherapy, however, if not restricted by this timeframe then the prevalent pool would double in both lines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded in the absence of other funded PARPi\u2019s, niraparib uptake would be 100% in the populations with gBRCA and sBRCA, respectively, and uptake in the ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutation status would reach 100% within three to six months.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, given available evidence supported once-per-patient-lifetime access to a PARP inhibitor, if niraparib were funded, the preference would be for first-line use due to greater evidence for benefits in the first-line setting. However, members considered that some patients would prefer to receive a PARP inhibitor in the second-line maintenance setting rather than first-line due to the risk of possible serious side effects including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier had proposed funding criteria that stated niraparib should be commenced with 8 weeks of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line or second-line maintenance. However, the Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria should align with what was used in the clinical trials for niraparib (ie 12 weeks for first-line and 8 weeks for second-line).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for niraparib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line or second-line maintenance, respectively, for ovarian cancer. These PICOs capture key clinical aspects of the proposals and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. These PICOs are based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. These PICOs may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPd\" alt=\"9.PNG\"></img></p><p>\ufeff<img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPs\" alt=\"9a.PNG\"></img></p>",

The Subcommittee noted that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008pufS/p001369\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib is currently funded for the second-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer with germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA) only, and that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P00000AHK3i/p001558\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib has been considered for first-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive BRCAm ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that about 80% of patients with ovarian cancer who receive first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy are platinum-sensitive, and considered that this sensitivity correlates with a response to a PARP inhibitor such as olaparib or niraparib.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that homologous recombination is a biological process that occurs as part of multistrand DNA repair and that the presence of identifiable errors in this repair process are described as homologous repair deficiency (HRD). The Subcommittee noted that well-known examples of HRD are mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (BRCAm) which can occur either in the germline (gBRCA) as hereditary mutations occurring in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer, or as somatic mutations (sBRCA) that arise within a tumour in about 6% of ovarian cancer cases. The Subcommittee considered that platinum-sensitive disease, in which platinum-induced single-strand DNA breaks are not amended, also has deficiency in this repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that other types of HRD occur in roughly 20% of ovarian cancers and that the population without HRD, including those without BRCAm (ie those who are HR proficient), account for 38-50% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan.

J Clin Oncol. 2020;38(15_suppl):1586</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with gBRCA ovarian cancer are generally diagnosed at a younger age than those ovarian cancer patients without a BRCAm, have an increased risk of other malignancies and may experience added anxiety about mutation inheritance, although members identified no evidence to inform whether there are quality of life or survival differences between ovarian cancer patients with gBRCA and those without gBRCA. In addition, members considered that there is currently no evidence to inform whether there are any quality of life or survival differences between sBRCA, HRD and HR proficient patients with ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is emerging evidence of a poorly defined population with BRCA-like phenotype where their disease behaves like BRCAm, possibly resulting from non-BRCA gene mutations or other complex changes (ie epigenetics) affecting the HR repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that this may occur in between 10-22% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan. 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.1586\" target=\"_blank\">Timms et al. 2020</a>) and that there are multiple approaches seek to objectively and prospectively define this population such as functional tests (eg RAD51), mutation profiling for indicative mutations (eg signature3 or HRDetect), and genomic instability tests (ie germline damage indicating poor HR), although each of these tests has varied and challenging requirements.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current tests used internationally for diagnosis of genomic instability (ie HRD) include the FoundationOne CDx (Foundation Medicine) and myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) although it is unclear which should be preferred due to biased data and self-chosen thresholds. The Subcommittee noted that these two tests have reasonable agreement in outcomes and high agreement on HR proficient results, although these tests will not capture the proportion of patients with BRCA-like phenotype of epigenetic cause. The Subcommittee noted that neither of these tests are used in New Zealand outside of clinical trials or private testing and that unverified, nominal estimates of these costs could range from $2,000-5,000 per test.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the sensitivity of the current BRCAm test is high due to the quality of the reference data but noted that there is less data available for other types of HRD. The Subcommittee considered that the BRCAm reference population data is predominantly from Caucasian patients and therefore its applicability to various other ethnic groups may overestimate population-level benefits of treatment in those other groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is an oral treatment that targets PARP-1 and PARP-2, and that the mechanism by which PARP inhibitors facilitate cancer cell death has been described previously. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is being assessed under <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/cancer-medicine-funding-parallel-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmac\u2019s cancer medicines parallel assessment process</a>, as it was submitted to Medsafe in November 2020 for the following indications:</p><ul><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy</li><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>monotherapy maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that many PARP inhibitors are either under assessment or approved internationally and in most cases, were initially considered or approved for the targeted population with BRCAm disease however these medicines are being targeted at a broader population over time. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib was recommended for funding for first-line maintenance and for second-line maintenance in Canada (CADTH), Scotland (SMC), England &amp; Wales (NICE; within Cancer Drugs Fund); although in all cases, improvement of cost-effectiveness was required.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Niraparib first-line maintenance</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from PRIMA, a multi-centre phase III randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 733 adult patients with newly diagnosed stage III/IV high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer who had complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, irrespective of HRD status (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1910962?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00edn et al. N Engl J Med. 2019;381:2391-2402</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib or placebo once daily within 12 weeks after completion of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy starting with a fixed dose of 300 mg with the trial protocol subsequently amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of 200 mg for patients with a baseline body weight of less than 77 kg, a platelet count of less than 150,000 per mm3, or both. The Subcommittee noted that treatment continued for 28-day cycles for 36 months or until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were balanced between groups, the trial was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome, and that participants were stratified appropriately according to their response to first-line chemotherapy, use of neoadjuvant therapy and HRD status. The Subcommittee noted that HRD was defined as the presence of a BRCA deleterious mutation, a score of at least 42 on the myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) test, or both. The Subcommittee noted that the myChoice test used a combined score of 0-100 with a cutpoint of 42 used to report HRD as positive or negative and that it was assumed that 50% of participants had HRD. The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA included both germline and somatic BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA used both RECIST and CA125 to define disease progression with histologic progression or clinical symptoms and considered this was a slightly different and more sensitive threshold than that used in other ovarian cancer literature. The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of</p><p><br></p><p>13.8 months, median progression-free survival (PFS), tested hierarchically, in the HRD population was 21.9 months with niraparib compared with 10.4 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.59; p&lt;0.001) and in the overall population was 13.8 months with niraparib compared with 8.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival data was immature at the interim analysis with 10.8% of deaths having occurred in the overall population. The Subcommittee noted 177 patients were still on treatment at data cut-off and therefore considered it likely that some continued beyond two years of treatment, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to indicate an appropriate duration of treatment for patients in response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses of PFS hazard ratios suggested there was greatest benefit from niraparib in the BRCAm population, a lesser benefit in non-BRCA HRD, and the least benefit in the HR proficient population. The Subcommittee noted that the greatest reported differences in PFS between niraparib and placebo were seen in the non-BRCAm HRD group (11.4 months) and BRCAm only (11.2 months), compared with HR proficient group (2.7 months) although the study was not powered to determine the size of effect in the latter population, therefore it was unclear if a significant benefit occurred in the HR proficient group. However, the Subcommittee noted that stratification imbalances were not correctly accounted for in the Cox regression analyses and considered that the HRD population drove the overall benefit, therefore the actual effect size was uncertain in each group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the PRIMA study design limited its ability to detect the significance of a PFS benefit in the HR proficient group and the trial did not enrol participants from Pacific regions therefore it does not provide efficacy data in Asian populations, in particular, who are more susceptible to metabolic faults in carboxylesterase 1 that may affect PARP inhibitor metabolism and treatment response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, overall, this single high-quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial provides evidence of a PFS benefit from niraparib first-line maintenance compared with current standard of care (observation) in the overall trial population, driven by a greater benefit in the HRD population (which included patients with germline and somatic BRCAm). The Subcommittee noted that niraparib first-line maintenance was associated with some toxicities, considered it would be associated with increased clinic requirements, but noted it was not associated with a decrement in quality of life.</p><h1><i>Niraparib second-line maintenance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i></h1><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from NOVA, a phase III randomised (2:1) double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 533 adult patients with platinum-sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to their last line of platinum-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al. N Engl J Med. 2016;375:2154-64</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib 300 mg or placebo once daily commencing no later than 8 weeks after completing their last dose of platinum-based therapy for 28-day cycles until disease progression, and that dose reductions to 200 mg or 100 mg were permitted in cases of toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were generally balanced between groups except prior receipt of \u22653 lines of chemotherapy which was reported in about half of gBRCA patients and about one-third of non-gBRCA patients, and roughly 10-15% of non-gBRCA patients received less prior chemotherapy than gBRCA patients. The Subcommittee considered this may impact the assessment of benefit in non-gBRCA compared with gBRCA populations from NOVA. The Subcommittee noted that the trial grouped patients as either gBRCA or non-gBRCA, the latter of which contained the HRD subgroup.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA enrolled patients with gBRCA and sBRCA but participants were not stratified by this status. The Subcommittee noted that patients were stratified by time to progression, use of bevacizumab in prior chemotherapy line (which occurred in about 30%), and response to prior chemotherapy line. The Subcommittee considered that the trial criteria selected for a BRCA-like phenotype. The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc testing of HRD using the myChoice CDx would have grouped patients with sBRCA as HRD rather than as BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that NOVA was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome of PFS using RECIST criteria (NOVA did not allow CA125 in its definition of progression). The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of 16.9 months, median PFS in patients with gBRCA was 21.0 months with niraparib compared with 5.5 months with placebo (difference of 15.5 months, HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.41); median PFS in the non-gBRCA HRD subgroup was 12.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59); and median PFS in the non-gBRCA group was 9.3 months with niraparib compared with\u00a03.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61, p&lt;0.001 in all three primary efficacy populations). The Subcommittee considered that these PFS benefits of even five months\u2019 improvement or longer and, by extrapolation, possibly survival benefits were clinically significant, noting that the time not on chemotherapy is important for this patient population in terms of quality of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the exploratory median PFS in the HR proficient subgroup was 6.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (difference of 3.1 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; p=0.02).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of outcomes according to whether patients had received two vs more than two prior lines of chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al. 2016</a>). The Subcommittee considered it was unclear whether there is a difference in effect for patients with gBRCA who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving better effect than in those with gBRCA who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy) and patients with non-BRCA HRD who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving a lesser effect than those with non-BRCA HRD who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy). The Subcommittee considered the post-hoc results did not align with biological rationales, as patients with non-BRCA HRD are generally quite well and are considered a chemotherapy-sensitive population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from a conference presentation reporting substantial drop-out in NOVA with 155/553 (28%) of patients discontinuing the study for reasons other than death, resulting in arm imbalances between arms and reduced availability of survival data availability (<a href=\"https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(21)00693-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Matulonis et al. [presentation notes]. Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women\u2019s Cancer (virtual): 2021 March 19-25</a>). The Subcommittee noted that subsequent treatment data and therefore crossover rates were missing for the discontinued population. The Subcommittee noted that imputed and estimated data, adjusted for subsequent PARP inhibitor use, was used to generate an adjusted overall survival estimate in the context of substantial missing data. The Subcommittee considered that there is a possibility of an overall survival (OS) benefit in the gBRCA population but, as the analysis was based on a small sample with several steps, this could not accurately indicate the magnitude of any OS effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA did not include low-grade serous or non-serous histology therefore potential benefits in those populations are unknown. The Subcommittee considered that NOVA provided evidence that niraparib second-line maintenance is associated with a PFS benefit for the overall trial population, with the greatest benefit seen in the gBRCAm population followed by the non-gBRCA HRD population. The Subcommittee considered that less benefit was seen in the non-BRCAm population which comprises both HRD (non-BRCAm) and HR-proficient patients, therefore the evidence cannot confirm the magnitude of any benefit for HR-proficient patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(18)30333-4\" target=\"_blank\">Oza et al.

The Subcommittee noted that quality of life (QOL) data indicates some toxicity, however, the QOL between patients who received niraparib and those who received placebo was the same. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence could be interpreted as there being no adverse impact on QOL with niraparib despite additional toxicities and clinic visits with niraparib and as part of a clinical trial, compared with usual care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the magnitude of benefit from niraparib on the HR proficient ovarian cancer population remains unclear.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the available evidence supports the use of one PARP inhibitor in a patient\u2019s treatment journey for ovarian cancer, <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">either as a first-line maintenance therapy or as second-line maintenance</span>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the data suggests there may be a class effect among PARP inhibitors for first-line maintenance (ie olaparib, niraparib, veliparib) or second-line maintenance treatment (ie olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) for ovarian cancer in terms of PFS, however, the clinical trial populations for these medicines differ in their definitions due to use of different companion diagnostics. The Subcommittee noted that olaparib has not been validated with HRD tests and considered it was uncertain whether the HRD results from niraparib trials could be applied to treatment with olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that the benefits from PARP inhibitors appear greatest in BRCAm disease with lesser benefit in a broader general ovarian cancer population however more thorough review would inform assessment of a class effect of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and what benefits may be expected in which clinical patient populations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently there is heavy demand on BRCA testing in New Zealand and that there can be significant delays in gaining timely access to genetic counsellors.

The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would increase clinical resource use to some extent for the existing population with ovarian cancer (eg genetic testing, monthly blood tests and medical oncology clinic visits, and repeated CT imaging perhaps twice during maintenance treatment).\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a similar magnitude of health system impact would occur whether funded for first-line or second-line maintenance, although patients may have a longer duration on maintenance treatment in the first-line setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that HRD testing is costly but quick to interpret given the yes/no result of the Myriad diagnostic.

The Subcommittee considered that, if niraparib were funded for somatic BRCAm, this could result in patients seeking a new test of a tumour tissue sample requiring a separate process involving a biopsy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the FoundationOne HRD test is validated only for rucaparib and that olaparib is not validated with any HRD tests, therefore would not be appropriate to test for HRD and treat with olaparib based on HRD results.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, whilst evidence of benefit was limited in the HR proficient population, funding niraparib for the wider ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutational status (ie an \u2018all comers\u2019 population) would enable access to a PARP inhibitor without the requirement for mutational testing. The Subcommittee considered that funding niraparib without requiring mutational testing may have a benefit for those unable to access costly mutational testing and reduce the health system impact from additional testing in the ovarian cancer patient population. The Subcommittee acknowledged the overall benefit in an \u2018all comers\u2019 population would be driven by the BRCAm/HRD population groups, noting HR proficient patient populations in the first-line are expected to have PFS of approximately 2 months. The Subcommittee considered that for these HR proficient patients, the short period of time until treatment progression would likely result in a shortened treatment period and recommended Pharmac undertake analysis to understand the cost of this compared with the costs associated with treating the \u2018all comers\u2019 patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would not be used in combination with any other anticancer medicines nor would it replace any anticancer medicines although members noted that combination treatment is being investigated in clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered that first-line maintenance with niraparib would provide an additional maintenance treatment option within a line of therapy, and that second-line maintenance irrespective of mutation status would provide an additional option for patients without gBRCA, as those with gBRCA could access olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that if more than one PARP inhibitor were funded, patients may choose to start treatment with either in a random fashion and that switching from one PARP inhibitor to another would be unlikely unless a patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity with one PARP inhibitor.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30 patients with gBRCA and sBRCA may be eligible for niraparib first-line maintenance per year, and that only patients with gBRCA would be eligible for second-line maintenance. The Subcommittee considered that funding the population with ovarian cancer irrespective of mutation status would result in much higher eligible patient numbers. The Subcommittee considered that a small prevalent pool may occur in both the first-line and second-line due to the timeframe to commence PARP inhibitor treatment post-chemotherapy, however, if not restricted by this timeframe then the prevalent pool would double in both lines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded in the absence of other funded PARPi\u2019s, niraparib uptake would be 100% in the populations with gBRCA and sBRCA, respectively, and uptake in the ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutation status would reach 100% within three to six months.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, given available evidence supported once-per-patient-lifetime access to a PARP inhibitor, if niraparib were funded, the preference would be for first-line use due to greater evidence for benefits in the first-line setting. However, members considered that some patients would prefer to receive a PARP inhibitor in the second-line maintenance setting rather than first-line due to the risk of possible serious side effects including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier had proposed funding criteria that stated niraparib should be commenced with 8 weeks of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line or second-line maintenance. However, the Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria should align with what was used in the clinical trials for niraparib (ie 12 weeks for first-line and 8 weeks for second-line).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for niraparib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line or second-line maintenance, respectively, for ovarian cancer. These PICOs capture key clinical aspects of the proposals and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. These PICOs are based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. These PICOs may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPd\" alt=\"9.PNG\"></img></p><p>\ufeff<img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPs\" alt=\"9a.PNG\"></img></p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that the health need of people with ovarian cancer, including ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer that is platinum-sensitive (ie disease progression has occurred 6 months or more after the end of chemotherapy) has been previously described, most recently by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/PTAC-record-2020-08-published-28-October-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC in August 2020</a> and by <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-02-15-Catsop-Record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP in February 2021</a> in relation to an application for the polyadenosine 5\u2019-diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib. The Subcommittee noted that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008pufS/p001369\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib is currently funded for the second-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer with germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA) only, and that <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P00000AHK3i/p001558\" target=\"_blank\">olaparib has been considered for first-line maintenance treatment</a> of platinum-sensitive BRCAm ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that about 80% of patients with ovarian cancer who receive first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy are platinum-sensitive, and considered that this sensitivity correlates with a response to a PARP inhibitor such as olaparib or niraparib.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that homologous recombination is a biological process that occurs as part of multistrand DNA repair and that the presence of identifiable errors in this repair process are described as homologous repair deficiency (HRD). The Subcommittee noted that well-known examples of HRD are mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (BRCAm) which can occur either in the germline (gBRCA) as hereditary mutations occurring in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer, or as somatic mutations (sBRCA) that arise within a tumour in about 6% of ovarian cancer cases. The Subcommittee considered that platinum-sensitive disease, in which platinum-induced single-strand DNA breaks are not amended, also has deficiency in this repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that other types of HRD occur in roughly 20% of ovarian cancers and that the population without HRD, including those without BRCAm (ie those who are HR proficient), account for 38-50% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan. ESMO Open. 2021;6:100144</a>; <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.1586\" target=\"_blank\">Timms et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020;38(15_suppl):1586</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients with gBRCA ovarian cancer are generally diagnosed at a younger age than those ovarian cancer patients without a BRCAm, have an increased risk of other malignancies and may experience added anxiety about mutation inheritance, although members identified no evidence to inform whether there are quality of life or survival differences between ovarian cancer patients with gBRCA and those without gBRCA. In addition, members considered that there is currently no evidence to inform whether there are any quality of life or survival differences between sBRCA, HRD and HR proficient patients with ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is emerging evidence of a poorly defined population with BRCA-like phenotype where their disease behaves like BRCAm, possibly resulting from non-BRCA gene mutations or other complex changes (ie epigenetics) affecting the HR repair pathway. The Subcommittee noted that this may occur in between 10-22% of ovarian cancers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141874/\" target=\"_blank\">Ngoi &amp; Tan. 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.1586\" target=\"_blank\">Timms et al. 2020</a>) and that there are multiple approaches seek to objectively and prospectively define this population such as functional tests (eg RAD51), mutation profiling for indicative mutations (eg signature3 or HRDetect), and genomic instability tests (ie germline damage indicating poor HR), although each of these tests has varied and challenging requirements.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current tests used internationally for diagnosis of genomic instability (ie HRD) include the FoundationOne CDx (Foundation Medicine) and myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) although it is unclear which should be preferred due to biased data and self-chosen thresholds. The Subcommittee noted that these two tests have reasonable agreement in outcomes and high agreement on HR proficient results, although these tests will not capture the proportion of patients with BRCA-like phenotype of epigenetic cause. The Subcommittee noted that neither of these tests are used in New Zealand outside of clinical trials or private testing and that unverified, nominal estimates of these costs could range from $2,000-5,000 per test.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the sensitivity of the current BRCAm test is high due to the quality of the reference data but noted that there is less data available for other types of HRD. The Subcommittee considered that the BRCAm reference population data is predominantly from Caucasian patients and therefore its applicability to various other ethnic groups may overestimate population-level benefits of treatment in those other groups.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is an oral treatment that targets PARP-1 and PARP-2, and that the mechanism by which PARP inhibitors facilitate cancer cell death has been described previously. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib is being assessed under <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/medicine-funding-and-supply/the-funding-process/from-application-to-funded-medicine-how-we-fund-a-medicine/cancer-medicine-funding-parallel-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmac\u2019s cancer medicines parallel assessment process</a>, as it was submitted to Medsafe in November 2020 for the following indications:</p><ul><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy</li><li><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>monotherapy maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy.</li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that many PARP inhibitors are either under assessment or approved internationally and in most cases, were initially considered or approved for the targeted population with BRCAm disease however these medicines are being targeted at a broader population over time. The Subcommittee noted that niraparib was recommended for funding for first-line maintenance and for second-line maintenance in Canada (CADTH), Scotland (SMC), England &amp; Wales (NICE; within Cancer Drugs Fund); although in all cases, improvement of cost-effectiveness was required.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Niraparib first-line maintenance</i></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from PRIMA, a multi-centre phase III randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 733 adult patients with newly diagnosed stage III/IV high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer who had complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, irrespective of HRD status (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1910962?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00edn et al. N Engl J Med. 2019;381:2391-2402</a>). The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib or placebo once daily within 12 weeks after completion of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy starting with a fixed dose of 300 mg with the trial protocol subsequently amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of 200 mg for patients with a baseline body weight of less than 77 kg, a platelet count of less than 150,000 per mm3, or both. The Subcommittee noted that treatment continued for 28-day cycles for 36 months or until disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were balanced between groups, the trial was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome, and that participants were stratified appropriately according to their response to first-line chemotherapy, use of neoadjuvant therapy and HRD status. The Subcommittee noted that HRD was defined as the presence of a BRCA deleterious mutation, a score of at least 42 on the myChoice CDx (Myriad Genetics) test, or both. The Subcommittee noted that the myChoice test used a combined score of 0-100 with a cutpoint of 42 used to report HRD as positive or negative and that it was assumed that 50% of participants had HRD. The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA included both germline and somatic BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PRIMA used both RECIST and CA125 to define disease progression with histologic progression or clinical symptoms and considered this was a slightly different and more sensitive threshold than that used in other ovarian cancer literature. The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of</p><p><br></p><p>13.8 months, median progression-free survival (PFS), tested hierarchically, in the HRD population was 21.9 months with niraparib compared with 10.4 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.59; p&lt;0.001) and in the overall population was 13.8 months with niraparib compared with 8.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that overall survival data was immature at the interim analysis with 10.8% of deaths having occurred in the overall population. The Subcommittee noted 177 patients were still on treatment at data cut-off and therefore considered it likely that some continued beyond two years of treatment, however, the Subcommittee considered that there was no evidence to indicate an appropriate duration of treatment for patients in response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses of PFS hazard ratios suggested there was greatest benefit from niraparib in the BRCAm population, a lesser benefit in non-BRCA HRD, and the least benefit in the HR proficient population. The Subcommittee noted that the greatest reported differences in PFS between niraparib and placebo were seen in the non-BRCAm HRD group (11.4 months) and BRCAm only (11.2 months), compared with HR proficient group (2.7 months) although the study was not powered to determine the size of effect in the latter population, therefore it was unclear if a significant benefit occurred in the HR proficient group. However, the Subcommittee noted that stratification imbalances were not correctly accounted for in the Cox regression analyses and considered that the HRD population drove the overall benefit, therefore the actual effect size was uncertain in each group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the PRIMA study design limited its ability to detect the significance of a PFS benefit in the HR proficient group and the trial did not enrol participants from Pacific regions therefore it does not provide efficacy data in Asian populations, in particular, who are more susceptible to metabolic faults in carboxylesterase 1 that may affect PARP inhibitor metabolism and treatment response.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, overall, this single high-quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial provides evidence of a PFS benefit from niraparib first-line maintenance compared with current standard of care (observation) in the overall trial population, driven by a greater benefit in the HRD population (which included patients with germline and somatic BRCAm). The Subcommittee noted that niraparib first-line maintenance was associated with some toxicities, considered it would be associated with increased clinic requirements, but noted it was not associated with a decrement in quality of life.</p><h1><i>Niraparib second-line maintenance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i></h1><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from NOVA, a phase III randomised (2:1) double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 533 adult patients with platinum-sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to their last line of platinum-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al.

The Subcommittee noted that patients received oral niraparib 300 mg or placebo once daily commencing no later than 8 weeks after completing their last dose of platinum-based therapy for 28-day cycles until disease progression, and that dose reductions to 200 mg or 100 mg were permitted in cases of toxicity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patient characteristics were generally balanced between groups except prior receipt of \u22653 lines of chemotherapy which was reported in about half of gBRCA patients and about one-third of non-gBRCA patients, and roughly 10-15% of non-gBRCA patients received less prior chemotherapy than gBRCA patients. The Subcommittee considered this may impact the assessment of benefit in non-gBRCA compared with gBRCA populations from NOVA. The Subcommittee noted that the trial grouped patients as either gBRCA or non-gBRCA, the latter of which contained the HRD subgroup.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA enrolled patients with gBRCA and sBRCA but participants were not stratified by this status. The Subcommittee noted that patients were stratified by time to progression, use of bevacizumab in prior chemotherapy line (which occurred in about 30%), and response to prior chemotherapy line. The Subcommittee considered that the trial criteria selected for a BRCA-like phenotype. The Subcommittee noted that post-hoc testing of HRD using the myChoice CDx would have grouped patients with sBRCA as HRD rather than as BRCAm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that NOVA was powered appropriately for assessment of the primary outcome of PFS using RECIST criteria (NOVA did not allow CA125 in its definition of progression). The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of 16.9 months, median PFS in patients with gBRCA was 21.0 months with niraparib compared with 5.5 months with placebo (difference of 15.5 months, HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.41); median PFS in the non-gBRCA HRD subgroup was 12.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59); and median PFS in the non-gBRCA group was 9.3 months with niraparib compared with\u00a03.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61, p&lt;0.001 in all three primary efficacy populations). The Subcommittee considered that these PFS benefits of even five months\u2019 improvement or longer and, by extrapolation, possibly survival benefits were clinically significant, noting that the time not on chemotherapy is important for this patient population in terms of quality of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the exploratory median PFS in the HR proficient subgroup was 6.9 months with niraparib compared with 3.8 months with placebo (difference of 3.1 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; p=0.02).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of outcomes according to whether patients had received two vs more than two prior lines of chemotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611310?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Mirza et al. 2016</a>). The Subcommittee considered it was unclear whether there is a difference in effect for patients with gBRCA who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving better effect than in those with gBRCA who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy) and patients with non-BRCA HRD who had 2 lines of prior chemotherapy (ie receiving a lesser effect than those with non-BRCA HRD who had &gt;2 lines prior chemotherapy). The Subcommittee considered the post-hoc results did not align with biological rationales, as patients with non-BRCA HRD are generally quite well and are considered a chemotherapy-sensitive population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted evidence from a conference presentation reporting substantial drop-out in NOVA with 155/553 (28%) of patients discontinuing the study for reasons other than death, resulting in arm imbalances between arms and reduced availability of survival data availability (<a href=\"https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(21)00693-4/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Matulonis et al. [presentation notes]. Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women\u2019s Cancer (virtual): 2021 March 19-25</a>). The Subcommittee noted that subsequent treatment data and therefore crossover rates were missing for the discontinued population. The Subcommittee noted that imputed and estimated data, adjusted for subsequent PARP inhibitor use, was used to generate an adjusted overall survival estimate in the context of substantial missing data. The Subcommittee considered that there is a possibility of an overall survival (OS) benefit in the gBRCA population but, as the analysis was based on a small sample with several steps, this could not accurately indicate the magnitude of any OS effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that NOVA did not include low-grade serous or non-serous histology therefore potential benefits in those populations are unknown. The Subcommittee considered that NOVA provided evidence that niraparib second-line maintenance is associated with a PFS benefit for the overall trial population, with the greatest benefit seen in the gBRCAm population followed by the non-gBRCA HRD population. The Subcommittee considered that less benefit was seen in the non-BRCAm population which comprises both HRD (non-BRCAm) and HR-proficient patients, therefore the evidence cannot confirm the magnitude of any benefit for HR-proficient patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(18)30333-4\" target=\"_blank\">Oza et al.

However, the Subcommittee considered that niraparib second-line could offer a PFS benefit to patients with sBRCA or HRD and possibly a lesser benefit to patients who are HR-proficient, although accompanied by toxicity compared with observation alone.</p><p><br></p><p><i>General</i></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that toxicity with niraparib was similar between treatment lines, and that a wide range of any-grade toxicities were associated with niraparib compared with placebo. The Subcommittee noted that quality of life (QOL) data indicates some toxicity, however, the QOL between patients who received niraparib and those who received placebo was the same. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence could be interpreted as there being no adverse impact on QOL with niraparib despite additional toxicities and clinic visits with niraparib and as part of a clinical trial, compared with usual care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the magnitude of benefit from niraparib on the HR proficient ovarian cancer population remains unclear.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the available evidence supports the use of one PARP inhibitor in a patient\u2019s treatment journey for ovarian cancer, <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">either as a first-line maintenance therapy or as second-line maintenance</span>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the data suggests there may be a class effect among PARP inhibitors for first-line maintenance (ie olaparib, niraparib, veliparib) or second-line maintenance treatment (ie olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) for ovarian cancer in terms of PFS, however, the clinical trial populations for these medicines differ in their definitions due to use of different companion diagnostics. The Subcommittee noted that olaparib has not been validated with HRD tests and considered it was uncertain whether the HRD results from niraparib trials could be applied to treatment with olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that the benefits from PARP inhibitors appear greatest in BRCAm disease with lesser benefit in a broader general ovarian cancer population however more thorough review would inform assessment of a class effect of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and what benefits may be expected in which clinical patient populations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that currently there is heavy demand on BRCA testing in New Zealand and that there can be significant delays in gaining timely access to genetic counsellors. The Subcommittee considered that funding a PARP inhibitor regardless of BRCA mutation status would potentially reduce the BRCA testing demand, although many clinicians would still test given potential familial implications. The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would increase clinical resource use to some extent for the existing population with ovarian cancer (eg genetic testing, monthly blood tests and medical oncology clinic visits, and repeated CT imaging perhaps twice during maintenance treatment).\u00a0The Subcommittee considered that a similar magnitude of health system impact would occur whether funded for first-line or second-line maintenance, although patients may have a longer duration on maintenance treatment in the first-line setting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that HRD testing is costly but quick to interpret given the yes/no result of the Myriad diagnostic. The Subcommittee noted that HRD testing is currently not available in New Zealand. The Subcommittee considered that, if niraparib were funded for somatic BRCAm, this could result in patients seeking a new test of a tumour tissue sample requiring a separate process involving a biopsy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the FoundationOne HRD test is validated only for rucaparib and that olaparib is not validated with any HRD tests, therefore would not be appropriate to test for HRD and treat with olaparib based on HRD results.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, whilst evidence of benefit was limited in the HR proficient population, funding niraparib for the wider ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutational status (ie an \u2018all comers\u2019 population) would enable access to a PARP inhibitor without the requirement for mutational testing. The Subcommittee considered that funding niraparib without requiring mutational testing may have a benefit for those unable to access costly mutational testing and reduce the health system impact from additional testing in the ovarian cancer patient population. The Subcommittee acknowledged the overall benefit in an \u2018all comers\u2019 population would be driven by the BRCAm/HRD population groups, noting HR proficient patient populations in the first-line are expected to have PFS of approximately 2 months. The Subcommittee considered that for these HR proficient patients, the short period of time until treatment progression would likely result in a shortened treatment period and recommended Pharmac undertake analysis to understand the cost of this compared with the costs associated with treating the \u2018all comers\u2019 patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded, niraparib would not be used in combination with any other anticancer medicines nor would it replace any anticancer medicines although members noted that combination treatment is being investigated in clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered that first-line maintenance with niraparib would provide an additional maintenance treatment option within a line of therapy, and that second-line maintenance irrespective of mutation status would provide an additional option for patients without gBRCA, as those with gBRCA could access olaparib. The Subcommittee considered that if more than one PARP inhibitor were funded, patients may choose to start treatment with either in a random fashion and that switching from one PARP inhibitor to another would be unlikely unless a patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity with one PARP inhibitor.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30 patients with gBRCA and sBRCA may be eligible for niraparib first-line maintenance per year, and that only patients with gBRCA would be eligible for second-line maintenance. The Subcommittee considered that funding the population with ovarian cancer irrespective of mutation status would result in much higher eligible patient numbers. The Subcommittee considered that a small prevalent pool may occur in both the first-line and second-line due to the timeframe to commence PARP inhibitor treatment post-chemotherapy, however, if not restricted by this timeframe then the prevalent pool would double in both lines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, if funded in the absence of other funded PARPi\u2019s, niraparib uptake would be 100% in the populations with gBRCA and sBRCA, respectively, and uptake in the ovarian cancer population irrespective of mutation status would reach 100% within three to six months.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, given available evidence supported once-per-patient-lifetime access to a PARP inhibitor, if niraparib were funded, the preference would be for first-line use due to greater evidence for benefits in the first-line setting. However, members considered that some patients would prefer to receive a PARP inhibitor in the second-line maintenance setting rather than first-line due to the risk of possible serious side effects including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier had proposed funding criteria that stated niraparib should be commenced with 8 weeks of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line or second-line maintenance. However, the Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria should align with what was used in the clinical trials for niraparib (ie 12 weeks for first-line and 8 weeks for second-line).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for niraparib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for first-line or second-line maintenance, respectively, for ovarian cancer. These PICOs capture key clinical aspects of the proposals and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. These PICOs are based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. These PICOs may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPd\" alt=\"9.PNG\"></img></p><p>\ufeff<img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007OBBK&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001dkPs\" alt=\"9a.PNG\"></img></p>",
