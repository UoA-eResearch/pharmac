3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
