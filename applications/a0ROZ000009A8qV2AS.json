The Committee was made aware of evidence that mortality rates for individuals with PWS had decreased over time and considered that these decreases could be attributed to earlier detection and treatment of the condition, the increasing proportion of patients who are managed by multi-disciplinary care teams, an increased focus on weight management and diet, and access to growth hormone therapy for children with the condition. However, the Committee considered that there remains a significant early mortality burden in PWS with a range of causes and that PWS conveys a high burden of disease. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PWS among M\u0101ori or Pacific peoples compared to other ethnicities. However, the Committee noted that inadequately managed PWS is associated with obesity, and considered that the burden of PWS for M\u0101ori and Pacific individuals with the disease and their families may be greater than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific people, given that the burden of obesity in New Zealand is greater among M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples compared to other ethnicities.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review of the use of growth hormone therapy in adults with PWS (364 unique patients) from 20 manuscripts that reported a variety of outcomes (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33296095/\" target=\"_blank\">Frixou et al., Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2021;94:645-655</a>). The Committee considered that the patients included provided strong numbers for this rare condition and noted that the median age was 26.2 months with median follow-up of two years.

The Committee was made aware of evidence that mortality rates for individuals with PWS had decreased over time and considered that these decreases could be attributed to earlier detection and treatment of the condition, the increasing proportion of patients who are managed by multi-disciplinary care teams, an increased focus on weight management and diet, and access to growth hormone therapy for children with the condition. However, the Committee considered that there remains a significant early mortality burden in PWS with a range of causes and that PWS conveys a high burden of disease. </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PWS among M\u0101ori or Pacific peoples compared to other ethnicities. However, the Committee noted that inadequately managed PWS is associated with obesity, and considered that the burden of PWS for M\u0101ori and Pacific individuals with the disease and their families may be greater than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific people, given that the burden of obesity in New Zealand is greater among M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples compared to other ethnicities.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review of the use of growth hormone therapy in adults with PWS (364 unique patients) from 20 manuscripts that reported a variety of outcomes (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33296095/\" target=\"_blank\">Frixou et al., Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2021;94:645-655</a>). The Committee considered that the patients included provided strong numbers for this rare condition and noted that the median age was 26.2 months with median follow-up of two years. The Committee noted that the authors reported a benefit on body composition, fat mass and muscle mass; some improvements in cardiovascular function in a limited number of studies; a variable impact on lipids; and no significant improvement in bone mineral density (although noting the data was short-term). The Committee considered that there was evidence from adolescent follow-up and cross-over studies that body composition worsens on cessation of growth hormone therapy. The Committee considered the studies provided very good safety data and showed a clear role of growth hormone therapy for improving body composition in the context of multidisciplinary care for PWS.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of evidence that was included in the meta-analysis by Frixou et al., from a randomised controlled trial including 46 adult participants (mean age 28 years) who received growth hormone or placebo for one year followed by growth hormone for two further years in all patients (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-lookup/doi/10.1210/jc.2010-0907\" target=\"_blank\">Sode-Carlsen et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2010;95:4943-50</a>). The Committee considered this trial provided data for a large number of patients with long follow-up. The authors reported improved body composition and improved respiratory function; the Committee considered the latter probably reflected muscle mass increase.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee was made aware of small studies that reported growth hormone therapy over six months was associated with improved mental speed and flexibility and motor performance in 19 adults of median age 25 (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00641.x\" target=\"_blank\">H\u00f6ybye et al. J Intellect Disabil Res. 2005;49:245-52</a>), and that reported no difference in change in total, verbal or performance IQ during a year on growth hormone compared with a year on placebo in a two-year crossover study of 25 adults who had growth hormone therapy in childhood (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27852283/\" target=\"_blank\">Kuppens et al. 2016. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2016;11:153</a>). The Committee noted that participants in the latter study with a lower IQ at the start of the study lost more cognitive function during the year on placebo than in the year on growth hormone than those with a higher IQ at study start although IQ deterioration during placebo treatment was not significant overall, and that body composition deteriorated significantly while on placebo. The Committee considered this evidence used validated measures and suggested an impact of growth hormone on cognitive function. Members considered that changes in IQ in the range of 15 points would be meaningful for patients and caregivers (eg from being intellectually disabled and requiring residential care to being within the normal IQ range and living at home).</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members were made aware of a one-year cohort study involving sequential MRI scans that reported an improvement in lean body mass, reduction in fat mass, improvement in overall balance and functional activity with growth hormone.

The Committee considered that the evidence was of weak quality and likely confounded by socioeconomic and other factors. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that changes to lean body mass and body fat were the strongest surrogate outcomes associated with growth hormone treatment in PWS and noted that changes in body composition associated with growth hormone treatment in PWS were often not reflected in changes to body mass index (BMI). The Committee considered there was insufficient evidence of a difference in benefits or risks associated with growth hormone treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk or all-cause mortality, but that there was possibly a benefit in terms of cognitive function. On balance, the Committee considered that the evidence supported funding for somatropin use in adolescents and adults with the key outcome being improved body composition. The Committee considered that care by a multidisciplinary team appeared to be the most important influencing factor.</p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a preliminary economic assessment of somatropin treatment for children with PWS had been carried out by Pharmac staff in 2006 (TAR 80 \u2013 Human growth hormone for children with PWS), and that somatropin was subsequently funded for this indication. The Committee considered that the estimated health-related quality of life impacts of PWS used in the 2006 analysis were not applicable to the adult PWS patient population but noted that the impacts of the condition spanned many domains of health-related quality of life and were generally of a moderate severity.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an estimate of the eligible population, if access to somatropin was widened for adults with PWS, of between 60 and 70 adult patients per year but considered this was likely an overestimate due to the high mortality rates associated with PWS.

The Committee noted that discontinuations of treatment due to malignancies and other complications are uncommon.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for somatropin if access were to be widened in New Zealand for adults and adolescents with PWS. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000MK5HP&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002eYLV\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p><p><br></p>",
