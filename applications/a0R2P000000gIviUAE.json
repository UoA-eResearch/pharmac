The Committee noted that no epidemiological evidence was identified relating to the impact of oral budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis on M\u0101ori health outcomes or Hauora Arotahi (M\u0101ori Health Areas of Focus). </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that an application for budesonide oral viscous nebules for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) was reviewed by the<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2017-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Gastrointestinal Subcommittee in 2017</a> and by the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC) in 2018.</a> </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>At the time, the (then) Gastrointestinal Subcommittee recommended that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for children with EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either intolerable or ineffective, with a high priority. The Subcommittee recommended that the application for funding of budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules for adults with EoE be declined, on the basis that adults did not appear to have the same difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there had been previous issues with supply of the budesonide respules to the New Zealand market, alongside pharmacy compounding issues for a pharmaceutical not registered or intended for use in this indication or administration method. Members previously considered that Pharmac should investigate if there is a supplier that would be willing to register a swallowed corticosteroid product in New Zealand for the EoE indication. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in May 2018 and recommended that that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed with a medium priority for proven EoE with dysphagia in those whose disease is not responsive to first line corticosteroids, with applications to be made by a gastroenterologist or on the recommendation of a gastroenterologist.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in making this recommendation, PTAC considered that there was sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of oral viscous budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in both children and adults and made no differentiation between the two groups, however PTAC did acknowledge the additional need of children, resulting from the difficulties with the oral use of inhaled fluticasone presentations in this population. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Dr Falk Pharma New Zealand Limited had recently received Medsafe approval for its Jorveza brand of budesonide orally disintegrating tablets for the treatment of EoE in adults aged 18 and older. The Committee noted that Jorveza is listed on Australia\u2019s\u2019 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Need</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee\u2019s previous view regarding the significant health need of people with EoE, particularly in children, who often have difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, currently, children and adults with EoE are clinically managed in the same way, namely first-line treatment with proton pump inhibitors and, if this is not successful, a 6-food elimination diet for 8-12 weeks is usually tried for children, but the latter has limited acceptance in adolescence and adults. If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation. The Committee considered that some of this trend is likely attributable to an increasing prevalence of people with treatment refractory EoE. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee\u2019s own views regarding the health benefit of budesonide oral viscous nebules in the treatment of EoE.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide and other swallowed topical corticosteroids reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the oesophagus and subsequently, the fibrotic remodelling of the epithelial surface.

In particular, the Committee considered that orodispersible tablets would provide an alternative for children or those with neuromuscular disabilities who find it difficult to coordinate the actuation of a nebuliser device with swallowing. The Committee noted that the tablets are not indicated in children and that smaller children may find it difficult to let the tablet dissolve in the mouth. </p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that adherence with the orodispersible tablets is likely to be significantly greater than with swallowed fluticasone due to these suitability advantages. The Committee considered that topical corticosteroids are also preferred to dietary interventions, particularly in children and young adults.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given the relative cost of budesonide orodispersible tablets, it is appropriate for individuals to have trialled other funded alternatives such as swallowed fluticasone prior to trialling budesonide orodispersible tablets. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of people with treatment refractory EoE was difficult to estimate given the increasing incidence of the condition. The Committee considered that there could be around 10 individuals per gastroenterologist within the country equating to approximately 700 people in total. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was difficult to know what proportion of these would be expected to receive maintenance therapy, however, most would be tapered off maintenance treatment and monitored for signs of relapse. The Committee considered that a 6-month initial approval period for budesonide orodispersible tablets would be appropriate. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at its 2017 Gastrointestinal Subcommittee meeting, it was considered that it would be appropriate to require individuals to trial swallowed fluticasone (where appropriate) before being eligible to receive funding for the budesonide oral viscous nebules. The Committee considered that it was appropriate to similarly target funding for the budesonide orodispersible treatment to this same group. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary of Assessment</em></h3><p>1.30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for budesonide orodispersible tabs if it were to be funded in New Zealand for EoE.

If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation.

The Committee considered that both the inhaled fluticasone and budesonide oral suspension provide evidence of histological, endoscopic and symptom improvement post-treatment, however, noted that there were no statistically significant differences in endpoints between the agents. </p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that following an audit of practice into the treatment of paediatric EoE in New Zealand, that higher doses of swallowed fluticasone (ie 700micrograms twice-daily) have had reported stronger efficacy than lower doses. </p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a trial comparing a budesonide solution versus placebo in patients with EoE with dysphagia (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33887475/\" target=\"_blank\">Hirano I, et al. Budesonide Oral Suspension Improves Outcomes in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Results from a Phase 3 Trial. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2022 Mar;20(3):525-534</a>). The Committee noted that patients who received the budesonide oral solution received strong histological improvement but only a mild symptomatic improvement. The Committee noted that the manufacturer had withdrawn this product from the market. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a common feature among the trials was the risk of a small number of individuals developing oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. The Committee considered that this would be expected in around 10-15% of those who are treated with swallowed corticosteroids and that this would likely limit maintenance treatment in these individuals. </p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there are several other treatments in other markets for the treatment of EoE including an orally disintegrating fluticasone tablet and biological therapies, including dupilumab, antolimab, and benralizumab </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered the evidence supporting the use of budesonide orodispersible tablets for the treatment of EoE to be strong and of high-quality, despite being limited to a small number of trials. The Committee considered that limited evidence comparing swallowed topical corticosteroids to nebulised steroidal solutions suggested there was little difference in clinical effectiveness.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the orodispersible tablet presentation of budesonide provides a suitability benefit over both funded (ie fluticasone inhalers) and unfunded (compounded viscous solutions) alternatives. In particular, the Committee considered that orodispersible tablets would provide an alternative for children or those with neuromuscular disabilities who find it difficult to coordinate the actuation of a nebuliser device with swallowing. The Committee noted that the tablets are not indicated in children and that smaller children may find it difficult to let the tablet dissolve in the mouth. </p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that adherence with the orodispersible tablets is likely to be significantly greater than with swallowed fluticasone due to these suitability advantages. The Committee considered that topical corticosteroids are also preferred to dietary interventions, particularly in children and young adults.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given the relative cost of budesonide orodispersible tablets, it is appropriate for individuals to have trialled other funded alternatives such as swallowed fluticasone prior to trialling budesonide orodispersible tablets. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of people with treatment refractory EoE was difficult to estimate given the increasing incidence of the condition. The Committee considered that there could be around 10 individuals per gastroenterologist within the country equating to approximately 700 people in total. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was difficult to know what proportion of these would be expected to receive maintenance therapy, however, most would be tapered off maintenance treatment and monitored for signs of relapse. The Committee considered that a 6-month initial approval period for budesonide orodispersible tablets would be appropriate. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at its 2017 Gastrointestinal Subcommittee meeting, it was considered that it would be appropriate to require individuals to trial swallowed fluticasone (where appropriate) before being eligible to receive funding for the budesonide oral viscous nebules. The Committee considered that it was appropriate to similarly target funding for the budesonide orodispersible treatment to this same group. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary of Assessment</em></h3><p>1.30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for budesonide orodispersible tabs if it were to be funded in New Zealand for EoE. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Committee noted that no epidemiological evidence was identified relating to the impact of oral budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis on M\u0101ori health outcomes or Hauora Arotahi (M\u0101ori Health Areas of Focus). </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee noted that an application for budesonide oral viscous nebules for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) was reviewed by the<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2017-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Gastrointestinal Subcommittee in 2017</a> and by the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC) in 2018.</a> </p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>At the time, the (then) Gastrointestinal Subcommittee recommended that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for children with EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either intolerable or ineffective, with a high priority. The Subcommittee recommended that the application for funding of budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules for adults with EoE be declined, on the basis that adults did not appear to have the same difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there had been previous issues with supply of the budesonide respules to the New Zealand market, alongside pharmacy compounding issues for a pharmaceutical not registered or intended for use in this indication or administration method. Members previously considered that Pharmac should investigate if there is a supplier that would be willing to register a swallowed corticosteroid product in New Zealand for the EoE indication. </p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC reviewed the application in May 2018 and recommended that that budesonide 0.5 mg/mL nebules be listed with a medium priority for proven EoE with dysphagia in those whose disease is not responsive to first line corticosteroids, with applications to be made by a gastroenterologist or on the recommendation of a gastroenterologist.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in making this recommendation, PTAC considered that there was sufficient evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of oral viscous budesonide for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in both children and adults and made no differentiation between the two groups, however PTAC did acknowledge the additional need of children, resulting from the difficulties with the oral use of inhaled fluticasone presentations in this population. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Dr Falk Pharma New Zealand Limited had recently received Medsafe approval for its Jorveza brand of budesonide orally disintegrating tablets for the treatment of EoE in adults aged 18 and older. The Committee noted that Jorveza is listed on Australia\u2019s\u2019 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Need</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee\u2019s previous view regarding the significant health need of people with EoE, particularly in children, who often have difficulty using a fluticasone inhaler and coordinating their breathing with the dispensing button. </p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, currently, children and adults with EoE are clinically managed in the same way, namely first-line treatment with proton pump inhibitors and, if this is not successful, a 6-food elimination diet for 8-12 weeks is usually tried for children, but the latter has limited acceptance in adolescence and adults. If proton pump inhibitor therapy and dietary treatment are ineffective individuals will typically receive swallowed inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) twice daily. </p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that swallowed inhaled fluticasone at higher doses is effective at achieving disease remission in many individuals, however, for many the method of delivery is unsuitable, as previously discussed. The Committee considered that there would be approximately 700 people with difficult to treat EoE for whom swallowed fluticasone is either ineffective or unsuitable. The Committee considered there to be a high unmet health need in this setting, with those affected being at risk of developing oesophageal strictures, dysphagia, and oesophageal perforation. </p><p>1.11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there has been an increase in the number of this population group presenting to hospital with acute food bolus impactions requiring mechanical dilation. The Committee considered that some of this trend is likely attributable to an increasing prevalence of people with treatment refractory EoE. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the comments made previously by PTAC and the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee\u2019s own views regarding the health benefit of budesonide oral viscous nebules in the treatment of EoE.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide and other swallowed topical corticosteroids reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the oesophagus and subsequently, the fibrotic remodelling of the epithelial surface. The Committee noted that it had previously considered evidence that viscous topical budesonide was more effective at coating of the oesophagus compared with the swallowed nebulised corticosteroid which tend to show some diversion into the lungs (Nennstiel S, Schlag C. Treatment of eosinophlic esophagitis with swallowed topical corticosteroids.

The Committee noted that there was a marked increase in histological remission in patients receiving orodispersible budesonide compared with placebo at six weeks (93% vs 0%, P &lt; 0.001) as well as endoscopic remission (61% vs 0%, P &lt;0.0001). The Committee noted that while the evidence of clinical remission was more modest, owing to the complex nature of dysphagia, there was still a significant improvement in the proportion of patients experiencing resolution of dysphagia in patients receiving budesonide compared with placebo (59% vs 4%, P &lt; 0.001). </p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in the maintenance of remission study (BUL-2/EER) after 48-weekls 73.5% of patients receiving the 0.5mg budesonide orodispersible tabs twice-daily and 75% of patients receiving the 0.5mg budesonide orodispersible tabs twice-daily were in clinic-histological remission compared with 4% of patients in the placebo arm (P &lt; 0.0001).\u00a0</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an evidence summary for inhaled fluticasone inhalers, budesonide suspensions and orodispersible tabs (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7288799/\" target=\"_blank\">Miehlke S, et al.

The Committee considered that the benefits of the budesonide orodispersible tablets were similar to that of the compounded viscous suspensions.\u00a0</p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the most relevant evidence for the New Zealand treatment setting was a head-to-head trial comparing fluticasone inhaler vs budesonide oral suspension over 8-weeks (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6581596/\" target=\"_blank\">Dellon ES, Woosley JT, Arrington A, et al. Efficacy of budesonide vs fluticasone for initial treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in a randomized controlled trial. Gastroenterology 2019; 157: 65\u201373</a>). The Committee considered that both the inhaled fluticasone and budesonide oral suspension provide evidence of histological, endoscopic and symptom improvement post-treatment, however, noted that there were no statistically significant differences in endpoints between the agents. </p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that following an audit of practice into the treatment of paediatric EoE in New Zealand, that higher doses of swallowed fluticasone (ie 700micrograms twice-daily) have had reported stronger efficacy than lower doses. </p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a trial comparing a budesonide solution versus placebo in patients with EoE with dysphagia (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33887475/\" target=\"_blank\">Hirano I, et al. Budesonide Oral Suspension Improves Outcomes in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Results from a Phase 3 Trial. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2022 Mar;20(3):525-534</a>). The Committee noted that patients who received the budesonide oral solution received strong histological improvement but only a mild symptomatic improvement. The Committee noted that the manufacturer had withdrawn this product from the market. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a common feature among the trials was the risk of a small number of individuals developing oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. The Committee considered that this would be expected in around 10-15% of those who are treated with swallowed corticosteroids and that this would likely limit maintenance treatment in these individuals. </p><p>1.22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there are several other treatments in other markets for the treatment of EoE including an orally disintegrating fluticasone tablet and biological therapies, including dupilumab, antolimab, and benralizumab </p><p>1.23.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Committee considered the evidence supporting the use of budesonide orodispersible tablets for the treatment of EoE to be strong and of high-quality, despite being limited to a small number of trials. The Committee considered that limited evidence comparing swallowed topical corticosteroids to nebulised steroidal solutions suggested there was little difference in clinical effectiveness.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the orodispersible tablet presentation of budesonide provides a suitability benefit over both funded (ie fluticasone inhalers) and unfunded (compounded viscous solutions) alternatives. In particular, the Committee considered that orodispersible tablets would provide an alternative for children or those with neuromuscular disabilities who find it difficult to coordinate the actuation of a nebuliser device with swallowing. The Committee noted that the tablets are not indicated in children and that smaller children may find it difficult to let the tablet dissolve in the mouth. </p><p>1.25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that adherence with the orodispersible tablets is likely to be significantly greater than with swallowed fluticasone due to these suitability advantages. The Committee considered that topical corticosteroids are also preferred to dietary interventions, particularly in children and young adults.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given the relative cost of budesonide orodispersible tablets, it is appropriate for individuals to have trialled other funded alternatives such as swallowed fluticasone prior to trialling budesonide orodispersible tablets. </p><p>1.27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the number of people with treatment refractory EoE was difficult to estimate given the increasing incidence of the condition. The Committee considered that there could be around 10 individuals per gastroenterologist within the country equating to approximately 700 people in total. </p><p>1.28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was difficult to know what proportion of these would be expected to receive maintenance therapy, however, most would be tapered off maintenance treatment and monitored for signs of relapse. The Committee considered that a 6-month initial approval period for budesonide orodispersible tablets would be appropriate. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at its 2017 Gastrointestinal Subcommittee meeting, it was considered that it would be appropriate to require individuals to trial swallowed fluticasone (where appropriate) before being eligible to receive funding for the budesonide oral viscous nebules. The Committee considered that it was appropriate to similarly target funding for the budesonide orodispersible treatment to this same group. </p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Summary of Assessment</em></h3><p>1.30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for budesonide orodispersible tabs if it were to be funded in New Zealand for EoE. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000BGAwU&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002eZQb\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
