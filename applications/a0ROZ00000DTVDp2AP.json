The Committee noted that treatment of donors of HSC does not fall within the M\u0101ori health areas of focus. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori had been shown to have a reduced chance of finding a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor, that matches 6 out of 6 loci reviewed, from transplant donor registries and therefore had a reduced likelihood of receiving a transplant. This reduced access to transplantation was particularly evident in people greater than 50 years of age (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15929115/\" target=\"_blank\">Tracey &amp; Carter, Am J Hematol. 2005; 79:114-8</a>).</p><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there to be fewer donor matches available for M\u0101ori, and that this can impact on uptake of allogeneic SCT.</p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that failure to collect donor cells due to non-mobilisation would also affect these potential recipients, as a haematopoietic stem cell transplant may no longer remain a treatment option, with consequent effects on their disease, and hence longevity, and intervening quality of life.</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that plerixafor has been previously considered by the Cancer Advisory Committee, as well as the Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee for the mobilisation of HSC for those undergoing autologous stem cell transplants. The Committee noted that plerixafor was funded in 2016 for this indication.\u00a0</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that HSC mobilisation involves the use of therapeutics to induce the movement of HSC to the peripheral blood from the bone marrow for collection, and subsequent stem cell transplantation (SCT), which is undertaken for autologous or allogenic SCT.</p><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that HSCs are commonly identified by the cell surface marker CD34. The number of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells in the peripheral blood are typically low (&lt;0.05% of the total leukocyte count), however, can be increased up to 5\u201315 fold through mobilisation with treatments such as GCSF or plerixafor. This results in CD34+ cells accounting for up to 6% of the total leukocyte count (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180285/\" target=\"_blank\">Bilgin YM, J Blood Med. 2021;12:403-12</a>).</p><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that mobilisation failure, or non-mobilisation, is commonly defined as the inability to collect greater than 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/kg CD34+ cells by apheresis. The Italian Group for Stem Cell Transplantation Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) has further developed definitions for poor mobilisation as peripheral blood CD34+ cells &lt;20\u00d710<sup>9</sup>/L after adequate mobilisation with GCSF, and where it is not possible to collect 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/kg CD34+ cells after \u22643 apheresis procedures (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180285/\" target=\"_blank\">Bilgin, 2021</a>).</p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that to donate HSC, donors commonly are treated with GCSF up to 5 days prior to apheresis, with over 80% of donors experiencing side effects including bone pain, headache, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180285/\" target=\"_blank\">Bilgin, 2021</a>).).

The Committee also noted that M\u0101ori had been shown to have a reduced chance of finding a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor, that matches 6 out of 6 loci reviewed, from transplant donor registries and therefore had a reduced likelihood of receiving a transplant.

It inhibits the retention of HSC in bone marrow and increases their number in peripheral blood. It is indicated, in combination with GCSF, to mobilise HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in those with lymphoma or multiple myeloma.</p><p>19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that plerixafor could be used in combination with GCSF either pre-emptively, in the event of inadequate peripheral blood CD34+ cell count after five days of GCSF, or after failure to obtain an adequate stem cell collection after one apheresis procedure (with plerixafor administered on the evening of the failed apheresis procedure).</p><p>20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589660/pdf/41409_2020_Article_1053.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Holig et al.

The Committee considered that mortality and morbidity in those people intended to receive HSC for their blood cancer is high if a transplant is not possible. </p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that serious adverse events can rarely occur from GCSF stimulation and mild to moderate adverse events may also occur from GCSF stimulation and apheresis collection.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that donors are generally well pre-mobilisation, and when GCSF stimulated collection fails, they may need to undergo bone marrow harvest (in order for them to provide the stem cells necessary for the recipient\u2019s treatment), which involves a surgical procedure with all of the clinical risk associated with a general anaesthetic and blood loss. The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2625420/\" target=\"_blank\">Halter et al. Haematologica. 2009; 94: 94\u2013101</a> study, which reported these risks include approximately 1 in 10,000 donors dying from a fatal complication, approximately 1 in 5,000 having a severe complication leading to hospitalisation and at least 1 in 3,000 developing a hematologic malignancy. The Committee also noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177619/#:~:text=All%20participants%20donated%20peripheral%20blood,%2C%20and%20headache%20(55.0%25).\" target=\"_blank\">Kim et al. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020;17:2316</a> study of peripheral blood stem cell donors, which reported high incidence rates of symptoms in bone marrow harvesting donors post-operatively, with the most commonly reported physical discomfort being myalgia (72.5%), followed by bone pain (62.6%), fatigue (60.3%), and headache (55.0%).</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there are psychologic impacts associated with donation, and bone marrow harvesting. The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36528407/\" target=\"_blank\">Winterling et al. Transplant Proc. 2022 16;S0041-1345;00779-5</a> study that reported that 39% of donors reported great worry about the recipient, and 12% also experienced great worry about themselves, as potential donors. In addition the Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177619/#:~:text=All%20participants%20donated%20peripheral%20blood,%2C%20and%20headache%20(55.0%25).\" target=\"_blank\">Kim et al.

The Committee also noted that M\u0101ori had been shown to have a reduced chance of finding a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor, that matches 6 out of 6 loci reviewed, from transplant donor registries and therefore had a reduced likelihood of receiving a transplant. This reduced access to transplantation was particularly evident in people greater than 50 years of age (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15929115/\" target=\"_blank\">Tracey &amp; Carter, Am J Hematol. 2005;79:114-8</a>).</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that whilst Pacific peoples had an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia, SCT was not usually used to treat this condition. However, the Committee considered there to be fewer donors available for Pacific peoples.</p><h3><em>Health benefit</em></h3><p>18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that plerixafor is a CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1. It inhibits the retention of HSC in bone marrow and increases their number in peripheral blood. It is indicated, in combination with GCSF, to mobilise HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in those with lymphoma or multiple myeloma.</p><p>19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that plerixafor could be used in combination with GCSF either pre-emptively, in the event of inadequate peripheral blood CD34+ cell count after five days of GCSF, or after failure to obtain an adequate stem cell collection after one apheresis procedure (with plerixafor administered on the evening of the failed apheresis procedure).</p><p>20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589660/pdf/41409_2020_Article_1053.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Holig et al. Bone Marrow Transplantation, 2021;56:635-45</a> study, a multi-centre open label, uncontrolled, phase 2 prospective single arm study with 37 people.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">20.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Those in the study were treated with 240\u2009\u00b5g/kg plerixafor once on the first day of apheresis (mobilisation was two doses of 7\u201310\u2009\u00b5g/kg BW per day GCSF for 5 days, with apheresis on day 5). The study reported that 21/ 37 donors (57% (95%-CI, 40\u201373%) collected \u22654.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>6</sup> CD34+ cells/kg during first and second apheresis. 36/37 donors donated &gt; 2 x10<sup>6</sup>/kg C34+ stem cells. The majority of adverse events were grade 1 or 2, with two donors experiencing grade 3 thrombocytopenia after second apheresis procedure, which was considered likely unrelated to the plerixafor.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">20.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it was a high-quality study that reported a high magnitude of effect. The Committee considered the study population was generalisable to the New Zealand population, and similar to donors outside of the trial setting. The Committee noted that 30 days post procedure, 86% of respondents would agree to receive plerixafor again, and no significant problems with graft vs host disease were observed in the HSC recipient.</p><p>21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9539930/\" target=\"_blank\">Zhang et al. J Clin Apher. 2022;37:388-94</a> retrospective study of 1008 allogeneic donors, of which 41 (4.1%) received plerixafor (0.24\u2009mg/kg) after the first or second collection day. After starting plerixafor there was a 0.75<span style=\"\">\u2010</span> to 7.74<span style=\"\">\u2010</span>fold (median 2.94) increase in CD34+ yield from the previous day. No donors with GCSF<span style=\"\">\u2010</span>only mobilisation who collected &lt;2.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CD34+ cells/kg on day one achieved the goal of \u22654.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>6</sup> CD34+ cells/kg over 2\u2009days, but 59.2% of donors who used rescue plerixafor did. Most donors (35) collected for 2\u2009days and received plerixafor before the second day of collection. Plerixafor was well tolerated in all donors.</p><p>22.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23944772/\" target=\"_blank\">Hauge et al, Transfusion. 2014;54:1055-8</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25721167/\" target=\"_blank\">Gatillo et al, Transfusion. 2015;55:1993-2000</a> retrospective studies.

The Committee noted that administration of plerixafor was a single subcutaneous injection alongside GCSF administration, with HSCs collected the following day. </p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if there was failure to harvest an appropriate number of CD34 cells, the donor may require a bone marrow harvest to be performed under a general anaesthetic, with its attendant risks. The Committee considered that avoiding general anaesthesia is preferable.</p><h3><em>Cost and savings</em></h3><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that it is likely, plerixafor is currently used in this setting, funded through a hospital rapid approval process. The Committee considered that if funded for allogeneic stem cell transplant donors, there would be fewer repeat donor searches, and additional blood testing for donor matching testing. </p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that plerixafor administration is less invasive than bone marrow harvesting, and would reduce the need for theatre equipment, staff, and time.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bone marrow harvest should be included in the comparator, as the mobilisation of HSC is time sensitive so there is likely insufficient time to find another donor. </p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the urgency and time sensitivity of SCT requiring bone marrow harvest if prior cell harvest was too low.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for plerixafor if it were to be funded in New Zealand for </span>allogeneic stem cell transplants<span style=\"color: black;\">.
