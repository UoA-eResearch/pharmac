The Committees and Pharmac staff valued this opportunity and considered that it helped to frame the Committees’ discussions about treatment of SMA in adults with a different perspective.</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The person with SMA described the losses experienced due to SMA as a cumulative trauma that is constantly affecting their life.

The Committees noted unpublished 2023 reporting by Richard Roxburgh and colleagues of the prevalence of SMA in Māori people being approximately 0.34/100,000 live births and corresponding incidence 1.7/100,000 live births (95% CI 0 to 9.3).</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that SMA is not included as a Māori health area of focus in Te Pātaka Whaioranga - Pharmac’s Māori responsiveness strategy.</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that from 1 January 2023, nusinersen has been funded for people aged 18 years and under with pre-symptomatic SMA or symptomatic SMA types I, II or IIIa. The Committees noted that Pharmac has recently consulted on a proposal to fund risdiplam from 1 May 2023 with the same access criteria as nusinersen.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that substantive feedback was received in response to Pharmac’s consultation to fund nusinersen and risdiplam, regarding access criteria. The Committees noted that consultation responses included feedback that treatments should be funded for all people with SMA, including those who start treatment after 18 years of age with the types otherwise eligible within the currently proposed criteria, and for individuals with SMA types IIIb, IIIc and IV.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The current eligibility criteria reflect the population requested in the funding application, the people identified by our clinical advisors as having the highest unmet health need and the most potential to benefit from treatment and aligns with the clinical trial evidence that was considered by our clinical advisors at the time. More information can be found in the Application Tracker record for nusinersen (for <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008puSr/p001050"" target=""_blank"">SMA types I II and III</a> and <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000009QXCv/p001488"" target=""_blank"">pre-symptomatic SMA</a>).</p><h3><em>Health Need</em></h3><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that the incidence of SMA in New Zealand is approximately 0.8/10,000 live births, equating to approximately 4-5 incident cases of SMA per year as per an unpublished study by Rodrigues et al (2021). The Committees noted that the unpublished publication described the current prevalence of SMA in New Zealand as 1.7/100,000 people, or approximately 80 people in total.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that the unpublished article by Rodrigues et al which stated that epidemiological studies suggest that 50-60% of incident SMA cases are SMA type 1, however due to the short life expectancy SMA type 1 is less prevalent than other forms.\xa0</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that SMA presents as a spectrum disease, and that there can be overlap in symptom severity between types. Members noted that the types of SMA are largely defined by the time of symptom onset, but also that there is an inverse correlation between severity and SMN2 copy number. The Committees noted that treatment in the pre-symptomatic setting is based on SMN2 copy number, as symptoms have not yet developed. </p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted data from the New Zealand SMA registry reporting that around 40 individuals on the registry were over 18 years of age as of 1 March 2023. The Committees noted that due to the voluntary nature of the registry, all people may not be included.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that individuals who are pre-symptomatic are unable to be classified as type I, II, III or IV, which are defined based on time of symptom onset; and so are classified by the number of SMN2 copies, due to current evidence indicating that number of SMN2 copies correlating inversely with disease severity.</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Type IIIb, III c and undefined III:</span></h4><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that individuals with SMA type III typically develop the ability to walk without assistance and have an unaffected life expectancy, however the Committees recognised that there are a range of mobility limitations ranging from abnormal gait caused by weakness in their hip and/or thigh muscles to loss of ambulation during adolescence or adulthood. In some patients, there may be considerable burden of disease with reduced employment, higher health needs, and psychological impacts that may be present for much of the individual’s adult life. The Committees considered that the impact of SMA over time for people with SMA type IIIb should not be underestimated, noting that they may lose ambulation and require a wheelchair later in life.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that all individuals with SMA type III represent a high proportion of the prevalent population (given lower to low survival rates in types I and II). The Committees considered that individuals with type IIIa were less likely to be walking at 10 years of age than those with SMA type IIIb. The Committees considered that individuals with type IIIa may have similar orthopaedic surgery needs to individuals with SMA type II, whereas individuals with type IIIb usually reach normal early developmental milestones.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that people aged 18 years and under with type IIIb, IIIc and undefined III had a high unmet health need. Members considered that at it can be difficult to differentiate between subtypes IIIa, b and c from due to phenotypic overlap and that this in part is likely explained by commonalities in SMN2 copy numbers.</p><p> </p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Adults with type II and III:</span></h4><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that people aged 19 years and over with SMA Type II and III SMA have high unmet health need. Members noted that adults with SMA, as with children with SMA, can experience substantial morbidity and in some cases early mortality. Members noted the impact of frequent medical appointments, hospital admissions, and reliance on carers. The Committees considered that SMA is a progressive disease, with symptoms gradually worsening over time, including the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the health need of families and whānau of people with SMA is similarly high across subtypes and age. The Committees reiterated the comments from PTAC in August 2018; that there is a high health need for family, whānau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families, whānau and support systems. The Committees considered that only those individuals belonging to households with the financial means to relocate can make the choice to move overseas, and that those living in more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. \xa0</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Type IV</span></h4><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that people with SMA type IV have a low health need compared with those with other SMA types. The Committees considered that the nature of SMA type IV symptoms is poorly defined. The Committees noted reports of individuals in their 20s to 40s being ambulant and requiring no respiratory support and/or maintaining a sedentary occupation (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4628728/"" target=""_blank"">Kolb et al. Neurol Clin 2015; 33:831</a>). The Committees considered that SMA type IV is a slow progressing form of SMA where limb weakness occurs gradually, and often without major motor impairments, respiratory impacts or changes to mortality. The Committees noted that the average age at symptom onset of SMA type IV is also poorly defined and that the subtype is broadly defined by individuals experiencing the onset of symptoms after the age of 18 years. The Committees noted that individuals with SMA type IV have a standard life expectancy.</p><p><br></p><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Nusinersen</span></h4><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted results from an observational prospective longitudinal follow-up study which aimed to determine changes in motor and respiratory function after treatment with nusinersen in adults with SMA (<a href=""https://cp.neurology.org/content/11/3/e317"" target=""_blank"">Duong et al. Neurol Clin Pract. 2021;11(3):e317-e327</a>). The Committees considered that the study’s population most closely matched the population of individuals with SMA in New Zealand in regard to ambulation status.

The study included six participants with a mean age of 33.7 years, none of whom had received prior treatment with onasemnogene (due to age) or nusinersen (due to complex spinal anatomy). There was no change in RULM score or respiratory function. There was an Egan Kallifikation 2 (EK2) Mean change -4.5(95%CI -7.3- -1.7, p=0.009), and a quality-of-life measure (QOLM) Mean change of +10.7(95%CI 1.4-19.5, p=0.027).

The Committees noted that this was due to similar mechanisms of action, biological plausibility, and similar outcomes when studies in other subgroups. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that after the age of 20 years, most of an individual with SMA’s motor neurons may be lost, and thus treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam would not be expected to regain lost function. By contrast, those treated early a greater proportion of motor neurons would be protected, with a resultant greater benefit. Members noted that there was limited available evidence to confirm that loss function cannot be regained with treatment. The Committees considered that for adults with SMA, while the published evidence suggests that treatment would not result in a significant improvement in motor function and other symptoms; the demonstrated maintenance of motor function provides a clinically meaningful outcome, which should not be underestimated.</p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted there was no published evidence which supported the use of nusinersen or risdiplam in individuals with adult-onset SMA (Type IV). </p><p>1.35.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that is the funding criteria relating to SMN2 copies were widened to allow for individuals to access treatment with up to 3 SMN2 copies, then most people who would later develop SMA symptoms would be diagnosed and treated symptomatically, however. Members considered that extension of the criteria to include 4 SMN2 copies may include individuals with milder phenotypes who have a reduced cost-benefit for treatment. Members commented it would be appropriate to have guidelines in place to ensure those who are identified as having 4 copies SMN2 copies through pre-symptomatic screening are monitored more closely for the development of symptoms.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.36.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally by a health care professional. The Committees considered that administration of nusinersen is often complicated in individuals with severe scoliosis. Members considered that adults with SMA types II and III, particularly those who are non-ambulant may experience significant scoliosis and mobility problems, as well as previous orthopaedic surgery, and therefore those affected may require alternative interventions to administer the treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35218574/"" target=""_blank"">Rad et al. Muscle Nerve. 2022;65(5):498-507</a><u>)</u>. The Committees considered that transport to a clinical setting for tri-annual infusions may be difficult for some due to the individuals’ ambulation status and potential distance from treatment centres and socioeconomic status. As such, the Committees considered risdiplam, as an oral treatment, would likely be a more suitable treatment and result in less inequity for non-ambulant adults with SMA.</p><p>1.37.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that due to the size of the risdiplam bottles, the oral liquid would not last long for adult patients. The Committee noted that a tablet form is currently being developed to overcome this problem.</p><h3><em>Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.38.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that the administration costs associated with giving nusinersen by lumbar puncture were high in comparison with zero administration costs associated with the orally administered risdiplam.</p><p>1.39.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees also considered that the benefit that could be obtained in people who were over 18 years of age at the time of treatment initiation was likely lower than that obtained for people starting treatment at the time of symptom onset (and far lower than that for people diagnosed and treated pre-symptomatically). However, the Committees considered the magnitude of treatment benefit highly uncertain in economic terms, and that while people with treatment may experience a less severe disease phenotype, advice from specialists treating people in this group would need to be obtained to ascertain the magnitude of benefit and a means of expressing and quantifying it in economic modelling.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.40.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The <span style=""color: black;"">Advisory Committees considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for nusinersen and risdiplam if they were to be funded in New Zealand for SMA in people who did not meet existing funding criteria.

In some patients, there may be considerable burden of disease with reduced employment, higher health needs, and psychological impacts that may be present for much of the individual’s adult life.

Members noted that adults with SMA, as with children with SMA, can experience substantial morbidity and in some cases early mortality. Members noted the impact of frequent medical appointments, hospital admissions, and reliance on carers. The Committees considered that SMA is a progressive disease, with symptoms gradually worsening over time, including the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the health need of families and whānau of people with SMA is similarly high across subtypes and age. The Committees reiterated the comments from PTAC in August 2018; that there is a high health need for family, whānau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families, whānau and support systems. The Committees considered that only those individuals belonging to households with the financial means to relocate can make the choice to move overseas, and that those living in more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. \xa0</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Type IV</span></h4><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that people with SMA type IV have a low health need compared with those with other SMA types.

The study included six participants with a mean age of 33.7 years, none of whom had received prior treatment with onasemnogene (due to age) or nusinersen (due to complex spinal anatomy). There was no change in RULM score or respiratory function. There was an Egan Kallifikation 2 (EK2) Mean change -4.5(95%CI -7.3- -1.7, p=0.009), and a quality-of-life measure (QOLM) Mean change of +10.7(95%CI 1.4-19.5, p=0.027). Patients reported a range of observed benefits including multiple motor improvements. All participants reported an overall improvement in strength, sense of wellbeing, and speech quality.</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">General</span></h4><p>1.32.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that where evidence was available for only one treatment (ie. risdiplam or nusinersen) within a patient group, that it was reasonable to assume that both treatments would provide the same or similar level of benefit within that group. The Committees noted that this was due to similar mechanisms of action, biological plausibility, and similar outcomes when studies in other subgroups. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that after the age of 20 years, most of an individual with SMA’s motor neurons may be lost, and thus treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam would not be expected to regain lost function. By contrast, those treated early a greater proportion of motor neurons would be protected, with a resultant greater benefit. Members noted that there was limited available evidence to confirm that loss function cannot be regained with treatment. The Committees considered that for adults with SMA, while the published evidence suggests that treatment would not result in a significant improvement in motor function and other symptoms; the demonstrated maintenance of motor function provides a clinically meaningful outcome, which should not be underestimated.</p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted there was no published evidence which supported the use of nusinersen or risdiplam in individuals with adult-onset SMA (Type IV). </p><p>1.35.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that is the funding criteria relating to SMN2 copies were widened to allow for individuals to access treatment with up to 3 SMN2 copies, then most people who would later develop SMA symptoms would be diagnosed and treated symptomatically, however. Members considered that extension of the criteria to include 4 SMN2 copies may include individuals with milder phenotypes who have a reduced cost-benefit for treatment. Members commented it would be appropriate to have guidelines in place to ensure those who are identified as having 4 copies SMN2 copies through pre-symptomatic screening are monitored more closely for the development of symptoms.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.36.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally by a health care professional. The Committees considered that administration of nusinersen is often complicated in individuals with severe scoliosis. Members considered that adults with SMA types II and III, particularly those who are non-ambulant may experience significant scoliosis and mobility problems, as well as previous orthopaedic surgery, and therefore those affected may require alternative interventions to administer the treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35218574/"" target=""_blank"">Rad et al. Muscle Nerve. 2022;65(5):498-507</a><u>)</u>. The Committees considered that transport to a clinical setting for tri-annual infusions may be difficult for some due to the individuals’ ambulation status and potential distance from treatment centres and socioeconomic status. As such, the Committees considered risdiplam, as an oral treatment, would likely be a more suitable treatment and result in less inequity for non-ambulant adults with SMA.</p><p>1.37.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that due to the size of the risdiplam bottles, the oral liquid would not last long for adult patients. The Committee noted that a tablet form is currently being developed to overcome this problem.</p><h3><em>Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.38.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that the administration costs associated with giving nusinersen by lumbar puncture were high in comparison with zero administration costs associated with the orally administered risdiplam.</p><p>1.39.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees also considered that the benefit that could be obtained in people who were over 18 years of age at the time of treatment initiation was likely lower than that obtained for people starting treatment at the time of symptom onset (and far lower than that for people diagnosed and treated pre-symptomatically). However, the Committees considered the magnitude of treatment benefit highly uncertain in economic terms, and that while people with treatment may experience a less severe disease phenotype, advice from specialists treating people in this group would need to be obtained to ascertain the magnitude of benefit and a means of expressing and quantifying it in economic modelling.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.40.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The <span style=""color: black;"">Advisory Committees considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for nusinersen and risdiplam if they were to be funded in New Zealand for SMA in people who did not meet existing funding criteria.

Members noted that the types of SMA are largely defined by the time of symptom onset, but also that there is an inverse correlation between severity and SMN2 copy number.

In some patients, there may be considerable burden of disease with reduced employment, higher health needs, and psychological impacts that may be present for much of the individual’s adult life. The Committees considered that the impact of SMA over time for people with SMA type IIIb should not be underestimated, noting that they may lose ambulation and require a wheelchair later in life.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that all individuals with SMA type III represent a high proportion of the prevalent population (given lower to low survival rates in types I and II).

Members noted that adults with SMA, as with children with SMA, can experience substantial morbidity and in some cases early mortality. Members noted the impact of frequent medical appointments, hospital admissions, and reliance on carers. The Committees considered that SMA is a progressive disease, with symptoms gradually worsening over time, including the loss of ambulation.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered the health need of families and whānau of people with SMA is similarly high across subtypes and age. The Committees reiterated the comments from PTAC in August 2018; that there is a high health need for family, whānau, and caregivers of SMA patients, and that some families have left New Zealand to seek treatment internationally, such as moving to Australia to access funded treatment, in some cases leaving behind their families, whānau and support systems. The Committees considered that only those individuals belonging to households with the financial means to relocate can make the choice to move overseas, and that those living in more difficult socioeconomic circumstances would not have this option. \xa0</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Type IV</span></h4><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that people with SMA type IV have a low health need compared with those with other SMA types. The Committees considered that the nature of SMA type IV symptoms is poorly defined. The Committees noted reports of individuals in their 20s to 40s being ambulant and requiring no respiratory support and/or maintaining a sedentary occupation (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4628728/"" target=""_blank"">Kolb et al. Neurol Clin 2015; 33:831</a>). The Committees considered that SMA type IV is a slow progressing form of SMA where limb weakness occurs gradually, and often without major motor impairments, respiratory impacts or changes to mortality. The Committees noted that the average age at symptom onset of SMA type IV is also poorly defined and that the subtype is broadly defined by individuals experiencing the onset of symptoms after the age of 18 years. The Committees noted that individuals with SMA type IV have a standard life expectancy.</p><p><br></p><h3><em>Health Benefit</em></h3><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Nusinersen</span></h4><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted results from an observational prospective longitudinal follow-up study which aimed to determine changes in motor and respiratory function after treatment with nusinersen in adults with SMA (<a href=""https://cp.neurology.org/content/11/3/e317"" target=""_blank"">Duong et al.

The Committees considered that the study’s population most closely matched the population of individuals with SMA in New Zealand in regard to ambulation status. The Committees noted that individuals were treated for a mean treatment duration of 12.5 months. The Committees considered that some broad objective measures, including various motor and respiratory measures, reported stability rather than the expected decline, while some results reported a non-significant trend towards improvement. The Committees noted that outcomes were not analysed according to subtype of SMA. The Committees considered limitations of the study included that it was observational, non-randomised and, not blinded (but considered that blinded studies were now unlikely to be conducted), the short follow up period, possible selection bias, and imprecision with wide confidence intervals.\xa0</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted a prospective three year SMArtCARE Registry-based observational longitudinal follow-up study that assessed improvements in walking distance during nusinersen treatment (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9881023/"" target=""_blank"">Pechmann et al. 2023;10(1):29-40</a>).

The study included six participants with a mean age of 33.7 years, none of whom had received prior treatment with onasemnogene (due to age) or nusinersen (due to complex spinal anatomy). There was no change in RULM score or respiratory function. There was an Egan Kallifikation 2 (EK2) Mean change -4.5(95%CI -7.3- -1.7, p=0.009), and a quality-of-life measure (QOLM) Mean change of +10.7(95%CI 1.4-19.5, p=0.027). Patients reported a range of observed benefits including multiple motor improvements. All participants reported an overall improvement in strength, sense of wellbeing, and speech quality.</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">General</span></h4><p>1.32.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees considered that where evidence was available for only one treatment (ie. risdiplam or nusinersen) within a patient group, that it was reasonable to assume that both treatments would provide the same or similar level of benefit within that group. The Committees noted that this was due to similar mechanisms of action, biological plausibility, and similar outcomes when studies in other subgroups. </p><p>1.33.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that after the age of 20 years, most of an individual with SMA’s motor neurons may be lost, and thus treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam would not be expected to regain lost function. By contrast, those treated early a greater proportion of motor neurons would be protected, with a resultant greater benefit. Members noted that there was limited available evidence to confirm that loss function cannot be regained with treatment. The Committees considered that for adults with SMA, while the published evidence suggests that treatment would not result in a significant improvement in motor function and other symptoms; the demonstrated maintenance of motor function provides a clinically meaningful outcome, which should not be underestimated.</p><p>1.34.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted there was no published evidence which supported the use of nusinersen or risdiplam in individuals with adult-onset SMA (Type IV). </p><p>1.35.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>Members considered that is the funding criteria relating to SMN2 copies were widened to allow for individuals to access treatment with up to 3 SMN2 copies, then most people who would later develop SMA symptoms would be diagnosed and treated symptomatically, however. Members considered that extension of the criteria to include 4 SMN2 copies may include individuals with milder phenotypes who have a reduced cost-benefit for treatment. Members commented it would be appropriate to have guidelines in place to ensure those who are identified as having 4 copies SMN2 copies through pre-symptomatic screening are monitored more closely for the development of symptoms.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.36.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that nusinersen is administered intrathecally by a health care professional. The Committees considered that administration of nusinersen is often complicated in individuals with severe scoliosis. Members considered that adults with SMA types II and III, particularly those who are non-ambulant may experience significant scoliosis and mobility problems, as well as previous orthopaedic surgery, and therefore those affected may require alternative interventions to administer the treatment (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35218574/"" target=""_blank"">Rad et al. Muscle Nerve. 2022;65(5):498-507</a><u>)</u>. The Committees considered that transport to a clinical setting for tri-annual infusions may be difficult for some due to the individuals’ ambulation status and potential distance from treatment centres and socioeconomic status. As such, the Committees considered risdiplam, as an oral treatment, would likely be a more suitable treatment and result in less inequity for non-ambulant adults with SMA.</p><p>1.37.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that due to the size of the risdiplam bottles, the oral liquid would not last long for adult patients. The Committee noted that a tablet form is currently being developed to overcome this problem.</p><h3><em>Cost and saving</em></h3><p>1.38.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees noted that the administration costs associated with giving nusinersen by lumbar puncture were high in comparison with zero administration costs associated with the orally administered risdiplam.</p><p>1.39.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committees also considered that the benefit that could be obtained in people who were over 18 years of age at the time of treatment initiation was likely lower than that obtained for people starting treatment at the time of symptom onset (and far lower than that for people diagnosed and treated pre-symptomatically). However, the Committees considered the magnitude of treatment benefit highly uncertain in economic terms, and that while people with treatment may experience a less severe disease phenotype, advice from specialists treating people in this group would need to be obtained to ascertain the magnitude of benefit and a means of expressing and quantifying it in economic modelling.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>1.40.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The <span style=""color: black;"">Advisory Committees considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for nusinersen and risdiplam if they were to be funded in New Zealand for SMA in people who did not meet existing funding criteria.
