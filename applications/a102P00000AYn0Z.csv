The Subcommittee considered that the lack of a dose counter on currently used salbutamol reliever inhalers is a safety issue, as it there is the potential for a patient to unknowingly rely on an inhaler for use in an emergency situation when it is empty.

The Subcommittee noted that there is a clinical trial underway for use of AIR in children, which will likely provide results for the use of AIR therapy in this patient group in approximately two years’ time (<a href=""https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=380466&amp;isReview=true"" target=""_blank"">ACTRN12620001091998</a>).

Comparatively, the Subcommittee noted that that switching from two actuations of salbutamol to Vannair 100/6 or 200/6, where Vannair 100/6 or 200/6 require one actuation for dose delivery, could lead to increased rates of overdosing adverse events associated with the increased intake of LABA. The Subcommittee considered that similarity in dose and the device itself is an important factor for patients transitioning to AIR.
