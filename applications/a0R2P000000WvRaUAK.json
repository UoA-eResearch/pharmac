N Engl J Med. 2018;379:2342-50</a>). The Committee considered the lessened precision with this wide confidence interval to be a limitation of otherwise good evidence from this single randomised controlled trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that durvalumab was administered for a median of 40.1 weeks. Of the PACIFIC participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy, 8.0% of those who had been randomised to receive durvalumab and 22.4% of those who had received placebo, subsequently received additional biological immune therapy.</p><p>The Committee noted that the median time to death or distant metastasis in the PACIFIC trial was 28.3 months with durvalumab vs 16.2 months with placebo (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68) and that there was a significant difference in overall survival at two years (66.3% with durvalumab vs 55.6% with placebo [95% CI, 48.9 \u2013 61.8%, P=0.005]). Members noted that the PACIFIC data was limited by small participant numbers at three years, but considered that the observed benefit of durvalumab could continue for a number of years.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any cause were reported in 29.9% of participants with durvalumab vs 26.1% with placebo, P=0.33. The Committee considered that PACIFIC patients could have had reduced health status at trial baseline from prior chemoradiation, and considered that the safety profile was generally similar between groups during the safety data collection period, with no significant differences between groups irrespective of event severity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the safety data collection period may have been too short to identify long-term immune-related adverse events in the PACIFIC trial, which generally occur more than 90 days after treatment completion. However, the Committee considered that long-term immune-related adverse events (e.g. pneumonitis or autoimmune hepatitis) are known to occur in approximately 20-30% of lung cancer patients treated with these agents, and many affected patients require substantial clinical management in terms of health service resource and impact on patient quality of life. Members noted that some patients may require lifelong management including high-dose corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and thymoglobulin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the PACIFIC trial patient reported outcomes were collected until 48 weeks, and that there were generally no clinically relevant between-group differences in patient reported outcomes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601496\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Hui et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:1670-80</a>). The Committee considered that at this time, some patients would have experienced disease progression accompanied by a decrease in quality of life, while others would be progression-free, and noted that EQ-5D-5L data from the PACIFIC trial was modelled (by an independent Evidence Review Group, based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE] single technology appraisal [STA] for durvalumab in this setting) to estimate health utility values of 0.810 and 0.776 for progression-free status and disease progression, respectively (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-019-00870-w\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Witlox et al. PharmacoEconomics 2020;38:317-24</a>). The Committee considered that, as with all settings where patients go on to receive additional treatment, patient-reported outcome data was confounded by use of subsequent treatments post disease progression.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Committee considered that PACIFIC provided high quality, high strength evidence of a substantial survival benefit from durvalumab consolidation therapy compared with placebo for patients with stage IIIa or IIIb (not stage IIIc) NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status without significant treatment-related adverse events or compromised quality of life for the majority. The Committee noted this assessment was based on one randomised controlled trial that was limited by the upper bounds of some survival-related effect size confidence intervals approaching 1. Furthermore the participants in PACIFIC might not resemble a New Zealand patient population, with the higher incidence of NSCLC in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Committee considered that Special Authority criteria should exclude stage IIIc disease, on the basis of an absence of evidence in this group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a published review including survival outcomes from the PACIFIC trial and survival outcomes from the LUN 14-179 single arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab consolidation following chemoradiation, which reported a similar survival benefit from pembrolizumab in patients with stage III NSCLC; 12 month OS was 83.1% with durvalumab (PACIFIC trial) vs 80.5% with pembrolizumab (LUN 14-179 trial); and 24 month OS of 66.3% and 68.7%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31686616/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Botticella et al. Ther Adv Respir Dis. 2019;13:1753466619885530</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a significant proportion of PACIFIC participants (21%) had PD-L1 expression of &lt;1%, and that a post-hoc analysis of outcomes according to PD-L1 status suggests that patients with PD-L1 expression levels of &lt;1% did not experience improved overall survival with durvalumab consolidation therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7244187/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">J Thorac Oncol. 2020;15:288\u201393</a>), although the Committee considered this analysis was subject to bias. The Committee considered that accurate and consistent pre-treatment PD-L1 testing may help to target treatment with durvalumab to those who would likely benefit most, noting that the UK (NICE) and Scotland (SMC) recommended a requirement for expression of PD-L1 on \u2265 1% of tumour cells in order to be eligible for funded durvalumab in this setting. However, the Committee considered that there were a number of issues associated with the consistent and equitable implementation of PD-L1 testing, which are detailed in previous clinical advice records for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that it is well documented that clinical trials for PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors use different assays (with varying sensitivity) to test and categorise PD-L1 status in NSCLC, leading to challenges with the use of set thresholds and definitions for patient populations across these agents. The Committee considered that the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in this setting may prove to be reasonable even if pre-treatment PD-L1 testing was not included in the eligibility criteria for funded treatment. The Committee considered therefore, that Special Authority criteria for durvalumab in this setting may not need to require PD-L1 status confirmation and that further advice could be sought from CaTSoP on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the two-weekly dosing of durvalumab (up to a maximum of 1 year) would significantly impact the DHB health resource as this population would otherwise receive monitoring only. The Committee considered that as seen for PD-1/PD-L1 in other indications it was likely that evidence would emerge regarding different dosing schedules. Members considered that at present, it is not feasible for this type of cancer treatment to be delivered in primary care (in part, due to administration as an infusion and patient management, given the adverse event profile), therefore any additional treatment infusions would impact on secondary and tertiary care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the survival benefit that patients with NSCLC could gain could likely be optimised by the appropriate sequencing of anticancer therapies, given the possible additional benefits that may result from prior treatments e.g. an abscopal effect:\u00a0shrinkage of untreated tumours elsewhere occurring concurrently with shrinkage of tumours form local treatment; resulting from prior chemoradiotherapy, that may expose an epitope to subsequent PD-L1 or PD-1 targeting treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it is important to determine whether the greatest benefits result from using checkpoint inhibitors in the early, consolidation or metastatic phases of the disease, especially given that earlier use may preclude later use. Members noted that first-line durvalumab (in a non-maintenance setting) did not significantly improve OS in the MYSTIC trial (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2763864\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Rizvi et al. JAMA Oncol. 2020;6:661-74</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was likely to be a class effect from use of PD-1/PD-L1 agents as maintenance treatment, as current data for pembrolizumab indicated it may provide similar health benefits in this setting, although the data is currently limited. The Committee considered that the evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in the treatment of NSCLC, and other indications, was continuing to evolve rapidly. The Committee considered that this application should be considered in the context of the wider treatment paradigm for NSCLC.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that early use should preclude subsequent funded use, as there is currently limited evidence of the use of multiple lines of PD-1/PD-L1 agent; the Committee noting CaTSoP\u2019s previous advice that, based on the current evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in NSCLC, it is appropriate for only one line of funded treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (such as durvalumab) to be accessed once per patient lifetime. The Committee considered that treatment should be discontinued in patients who experience a lack of treatment response, and that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Committee considered that there is evidence of a significant benefit in PFS and OS from durvalumab in patients with NSCLC, with a generally manageable safety profile.</p>",

The Committee noted this assessment was based on one randomised controlled trial that was limited by the upper bounds of some survival-related effect size confidence intervals approaching 1. Furthermore the participants in PACIFIC might not resemble a New Zealand patient population, with the higher incidence of NSCLC in M\u0101ori and Pacific people. The Committee considered that Special Authority criteria should exclude stage IIIc disease, on the basis of an absence of evidence in this group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a published review including survival outcomes from the PACIFIC trial and survival outcomes from the LUN 14-179 single arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab consolidation following chemoradiation, which reported a similar survival benefit from pembrolizumab in patients with stage III NSCLC; 12 month OS was 83.1% with durvalumab (PACIFIC trial) vs 80.5% with pembrolizumab (LUN 14-179 trial); and 24 month OS of 66.3% and 68.7%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31686616/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Botticella et al.

The Committee considered that accurate and consistent pre-treatment PD-L1 testing may help to target treatment with durvalumab to those who would likely benefit most, noting that the UK (NICE) and Scotland (SMC) recommended a requirement for expression of PD-L1 on \u2265 1% of tumour cells in order to be eligible for funded durvalumab in this setting. However, the Committee considered that there were a number of issues associated with the consistent and equitable implementation of PD-L1 testing, which are detailed in previous clinical advice records for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that it is well documented that clinical trials for PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors use different assays (with varying sensitivity) to test and categorise PD-L1 status in NSCLC, leading to challenges with the use of set thresholds and definitions for patient populations across these agents. The Committee considered that the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in this setting may prove to be reasonable even if pre-treatment PD-L1 testing was not included in the eligibility criteria for funded treatment. The Committee considered therefore, that Special Authority criteria for durvalumab in this setting may not need to require PD-L1 status confirmation and that further advice could be sought from CaTSoP on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the two-weekly dosing of durvalumab (up to a maximum of 1 year) would significantly impact the DHB health resource as this population would otherwise receive monitoring only. The Committee considered that as seen for PD-1/PD-L1 in other indications it was likely that evidence would emerge regarding different dosing schedules. Members considered that at present, it is not feasible for this type of cancer treatment to be delivered in primary care (in part, due to administration as an infusion and patient management, given the adverse event profile), therefore any additional treatment infusions would impact on secondary and tertiary care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the survival benefit that patients with NSCLC could gain could likely be optimised by the appropriate sequencing of anticancer therapies, given the possible additional benefits that may result from prior treatments e.g. an abscopal effect:\u00a0shrinkage of untreated tumours elsewhere occurring concurrently with shrinkage of tumours form local treatment; resulting from prior chemoradiotherapy, that may expose an epitope to subsequent PD-L1 or PD-1 targeting treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it is important to determine whether the greatest benefits result from using checkpoint inhibitors in the early, consolidation or metastatic phases of the disease, especially given that earlier use may preclude later use. Members noted that first-line durvalumab (in a non-maintenance setting) did not significantly improve OS in the MYSTIC trial (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2763864\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Rizvi et al. JAMA Oncol. 2020;6:661-74</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was likely to be a class effect from use of PD-1/PD-L1 agents as maintenance treatment, as current data for pembrolizumab indicated it may provide similar health benefits in this setting, although the data is currently limited. The Committee considered that the evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in the treatment of NSCLC, and other indications, was continuing to evolve rapidly. The Committee considered that this application should be considered in the context of the wider treatment paradigm for NSCLC.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that early use should preclude subsequent funded use, as there is currently limited evidence of the use of multiple lines of PD-1/PD-L1 agent; the Committee noting CaTSoP\u2019s previous advice that, based on the current evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in NSCLC, it is appropriate for only one line of funded treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (such as durvalumab) to be accessed once per patient lifetime. The Committee considered that treatment should be discontinued in patients who experience a lack of treatment response, and that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Committee considered that there is evidence of a significant benefit in PFS and OS from durvalumab in patients with NSCLC, with a generally manageable safety profile.</p>",

The Committee considered that Special Authority criteria should exclude stage IIIc disease, on the basis of an absence of evidence in this group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted a published review including survival outcomes from the PACIFIC trial and survival outcomes from the LUN 14-179 single arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab consolidation following chemoradiation, which reported a similar survival benefit from pembrolizumab in patients with stage III NSCLC; 12 month OS was 83.1% with durvalumab (PACIFIC trial) vs 80.5% with pembrolizumab (LUN 14-179 trial); and 24 month OS of 66.3% and 68.7%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31686616/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Botticella et al. Ther Adv Respir Dis. 2019;13:1753466619885530</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that a significant proportion of PACIFIC participants (21%) had PD-L1 expression of &lt;1%, and that a post-hoc analysis of outcomes according to PD-L1 status suggests that patients with PD-L1 expression levels of &lt;1% did not experience improved overall survival with durvalumab consolidation therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7244187/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">J Thorac Oncol. 2020;15:288\u201393</a>), although the Committee considered this analysis was subject to bias. The Committee considered that accurate and consistent pre-treatment PD-L1 testing may help to target treatment with durvalumab to those who would likely benefit most, noting that the UK (NICE) and Scotland (SMC) recommended a requirement for expression of PD-L1 on \u2265 1% of tumour cells in order to be eligible for funded durvalumab in this setting. However, the Committee considered that there were a number of issues associated with the consistent and equitable implementation of PD-L1 testing, which are detailed in previous clinical advice records for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that it is well documented that clinical trials for PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors use different assays (with varying sensitivity) to test and categorise PD-L1 status in NSCLC, leading to challenges with the use of set thresholds and definitions for patient populations across these agents. The Committee considered that the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in this setting may prove to be reasonable even if pre-treatment PD-L1 testing was not included in the eligibility criteria for funded treatment. The Committee considered therefore, that Special Authority criteria for durvalumab in this setting may not need to require PD-L1 status confirmation and that further advice could be sought from CaTSoP on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the two-weekly dosing of durvalumab (up to a maximum of 1 year) would significantly impact the DHB health resource as this population would otherwise receive monitoring only. The Committee considered that as seen for PD-1/PD-L1 in other indications it was likely that evidence would emerge regarding different dosing schedules. Members considered that at present, it is not feasible for this type of cancer treatment to be delivered in primary care (in part, due to administration as an infusion and patient management, given the adverse event profile), therefore any additional treatment infusions would impact on secondary and tertiary care.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the survival benefit that patients with NSCLC could gain could likely be optimised by the appropriate sequencing of anticancer therapies, given the possible additional benefits that may result from prior treatments e.g. an abscopal effect:\u00a0shrinkage of untreated tumours elsewhere occurring concurrently with shrinkage of tumours form local treatment; resulting from prior chemoradiotherapy, that may expose an epitope to subsequent PD-L1 or PD-1 targeting treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it is important to determine whether the greatest benefits result from using checkpoint inhibitors in the early, consolidation or metastatic phases of the disease, especially given that earlier use may preclude later use. Members noted that first-line durvalumab (in a non-maintenance setting) did not significantly improve OS in the MYSTIC trial (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2763864\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">Rizvi et al. JAMA Oncol. 2020;6:661-74</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there was likely to be a class effect from use of PD-1/PD-L1 agents as maintenance treatment, as current data for pembrolizumab indicated it may provide similar health benefits in this setting, although the data is currently limited. The Committee considered that the evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in the treatment of NSCLC, and other indications, was continuing to evolve rapidly. The Committee considered that this application should be considered in the context of the wider treatment paradigm for NSCLC.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that early use should preclude subsequent funded use, as there is currently limited evidence of the use of multiple lines of PD-1/PD-L1 agent; the Committee noting CaTSoP\u2019s previous advice that, based on the current evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 agents in NSCLC, it is appropriate for only one line of funded treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (such as durvalumab) to be accessed once per patient lifetime. The Committee considered that treatment should be discontinued in patients who experience a lack of treatment response, and that the Special Authority criteria should reflect this.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the Committee considered that there is evidence of a significant benefit in PFS and OS from durvalumab in patients with NSCLC, with a generally manageable safety profile.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that patients with stage III NSCLC currently have a median progression-free survival of about 8 months, overall survival of 28 months or less and about 70-85% die by 5 years.

The Subcommittee noted that the patient population for this application differs from that previously considered and members considered this patient population could substantially benefit from a potentially curative treatment that may reduce the number of patients who develop metastatic disease and therefore require palliative treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that phase II/III randomised clinical trial evidence of systemic maintenance treatment with chemotherapy following chemoradiation indicated no benefit on progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380636/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Cheema et al.

The Subcommittee noted that no other studies currently investigate this approach in the same patient population, and that the Keynote-799 trial of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC includes a different group of patients with advanced disease.

The Subcommittee noted that the European Medicines Authority (EMA) had requested a specific, post-hoc PD-L1 analysis using a 1% PD-L1 threshold that identified less PFS and OS benefit in patients with PD-L1 status of &lt;1% (<a href=\"https://oncologypro.esmo.org/meeting-resources/esmo-virtual-congress-2020/durvalumab-after-chemoradiotherapy-in-stage-iii-nsclc-4-year-survival-update-from-the-phase-iii-pacific-trial\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Faivre-Finn et al. 2020</b></a>), however, the Subcommittee considered the interpretation of this analysis was limited by its post-hoc nature. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous considerations regarding the current landscape of PD-L1 testing in New Zealand (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>CaTSoP, April 2019</b></a><b>; </b><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-07-03-Catsop-Record-Web-version-Final-ready-to-upload.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>CaTSoP, July 2020</b></a>) and considered that hierarchical sample testing and limited tumour sample availability present additional challenges. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in PACIFIC adverse events were more common with durvalumab than placebo in this group of patients who would otherwise not be receiving active treatment. The Subcommittee noted that treatment discontinuation rates were higher with durvalumab (~15%) than placebo (~10%), most commonly due to pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, and considered that these patients would likely experience disease-related symptoms and toxicities from other treatments as reflected in the discontinuation rate in the placebo group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there were no new immune-related safety signals in PACIFIC and considered the immune-related adverse events reported were as expected (ie. similar to those occurring with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the PACIFIC patient-reported outcome data was collected up to 48 weeks in a high proportion of patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601496\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Hui et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:1670-80</b></a>), however, it did not capture the post-treatment benefit of being without disease relapse (compared with having disease relapse), nor did it capture a difference in hospital admissions or relapse-related symptoms that may also impact family/wh\u0101nau. The Subcommittee considered this data indicated that durvalumab maintenance did not decrease quality of life compared with placebo (a clinically meaningful consideration for maintenance treatment). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the PACIFIC trial was well-designed and provided moderate quality evidence of a clear PFS and OS benefit from 12 months of durvalumab maintenance for unresectable stage III NSCLC. The Subcommittee noted that, but that the cross-over to subsequent treatments may have actually diminished the reported OS difference between groups in the PACIFIC trial, and thus the proportion of patients who would be cured with durvalumab maintenance in the absence of cross-over was uncertain. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of durvalumab maintenance in patients with PD-L1 &lt;1% was unclear, that the post-hoc evidence was insufficient to confirm whether there is a benefit in this group but that a benefit could not be excluded. The Subcommittee also stressed that treatment with durvalumab could expose patients who otherwise would not receive active treatment to potential toxicity.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that durvalumab maintenance would not replace any currently funded treatments and would be an additional cost, with vial sharing not feasible in all cases due to its short shelf life once opened, patient scheduling and patient numbers at each treatment centre. The Subcommittee considered that additional health resource would be required for durvalumab including fortnightly treatment administration, monthly clinical assessments, increased monitoring (eg three-monthly CT scans), and management of expected immune-related adverse events. The Subcommittee considered that fortnightly treatment may be challenging for rural patients and those in high deprivation areas. </p><p>Specific advice sought from CaTSoP by PTAC regarding durvalumab</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no evidence for maintenance treatment using other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (eg atezolizumab, pembrolizumab) to inform assessment of a possible class effect of these agents in the first-line maintenance setting. The Subcommittee noted that no other studies currently investigate this approach in the same patient population, and that the Keynote-799 trial of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC includes a different group of patients with advanced disease. The Subcommittee considered that over time it was likely that a class effect would be observed for the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in this setting, as has been observed in other treatment settings.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 100 patients per year (without a year 1 bolus due to commencing within 6 weeks after chemoradiation) could be eligible for durvalumab, if funded for first-line maintenance treatment of unresectable NSCLC, and considered that a funded treatment duration of 12 months was appropriate given the evidence for this treatment period.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for durvalumab first-line maintenance for NSCLC should require three-monthly renewal, due to the high cost of the medicine to ensure appropriate monitoring and use, and considered that treatment with durvalumab should stop at signs of progression. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that Special Authority criteria requiring PD-L1 testing and positivity would be reasonable to target funded treatment to those who would receive the greatest benefit, if required to appropriately control pharmaceutical expenditure, noting the health system costs and challenges associated with PD-L1 testing and the uncertain benefit in patients with PD-L1 &lt;1%.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if maintenance treatment with durvalumab were funded for unresectable NSCLC, the funding criteria for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for metastatic NSCLC should be amended to exclude their use in patients who experienced disease progression on PD-L1 treatment, as there is insufficient evidence of benefits of re-treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor beyond progression.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a very small number of patients may experience immune-related adverse events with durvalumab (eg. diarrhoea or colitis) that require subsequent treatment with a biologic treatment (eg. infliximab) and additional hospital visits for management of toxicity.</p>",

The Subcommittee noted that patients with stage III NSCLC currently have a median progression-free survival of about 8 months, overall survival of 28 months or less and about 70-85% die by 5 years.

The Subcommittee noted that the patient population for this application differs from that previously considered and members considered this patient population could substantially benefit from a potentially curative treatment that may reduce the number of patients who develop metastatic disease and therefore require palliative treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that phase II/III randomised clinical trial evidence of systemic maintenance treatment with chemotherapy following chemoradiation indicated no benefit on progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380636/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Cheema et al.

The Subcommittee noted that there was no other evidence of retreatment with durvalumab or other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors after disease progression during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in PACIFIC, PD-L1 status according to the Ventana SP263 assay was not required to be known at baseline and that the initial analysis did not identify a clear difference between treatment arms with respect to PD-L1 status, with a threshold of 25% PD-L1 expression and unknown PD-L1 status in about one third of patients. The Subcommittee noted that the European Medicines Authority (EMA) had requested a specific, post-hoc PD-L1 analysis using a 1% PD-L1 threshold that identified less PFS and OS benefit in patients with PD-L1 status of &lt;1% (<a href=\"https://oncologypro.esmo.org/meeting-resources/esmo-virtual-congress-2020/durvalumab-after-chemoradiotherapy-in-stage-iii-nsclc-4-year-survival-update-from-the-phase-iii-pacific-trial\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Faivre-Finn et al. 2020</b></a>), however, the Subcommittee considered the interpretation of this analysis was limited by its post-hoc nature. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous considerations regarding the current landscape of PD-L1 testing in New Zealand (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>CaTSoP, April 2019</b></a><b>; </b><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2020-07-03-Catsop-Record-Web-version-Final-ready-to-upload.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>CaTSoP, July 2020</b></a>) and considered that hierarchical sample testing and limited tumour sample availability present additional challenges. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in PACIFIC adverse events were more common with durvalumab than placebo in this group of patients who would otherwise not be receiving active treatment. The Subcommittee noted that treatment discontinuation rates were higher with durvalumab (~15%) than placebo (~10%), most commonly due to pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, and considered that these patients would likely experience disease-related symptoms and toxicities from other treatments as reflected in the discontinuation rate in the placebo group. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there were no new immune-related safety signals in PACIFIC and considered the immune-related adverse events reported were as expected (ie. similar to those occurring with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the PACIFIC patient-reported outcome data was collected up to 48 weeks in a high proportion of patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601496\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Hui et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:1670-80</b></a>), however, it did not capture the post-treatment benefit of being without disease relapse (compared with having disease relapse), nor did it capture a difference in hospital admissions or relapse-related symptoms that may also impact family/wh\u0101nau. The Subcommittee considered this data indicated that durvalumab maintenance did not decrease quality of life compared with placebo (a clinically meaningful consideration for maintenance treatment). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Overall, the Subcommittee considered that the PACIFIC trial was well-designed and provided moderate quality evidence of a clear PFS and OS benefit from 12 months of durvalumab maintenance for unresectable stage III NSCLC. The Subcommittee noted that, but that the cross-over to subsequent treatments may have actually diminished the reported OS difference between groups in the PACIFIC trial, and thus the proportion of patients who would be cured with durvalumab maintenance in the absence of cross-over was uncertain. The Subcommittee considered that the benefit of durvalumab maintenance in patients with PD-L1 &lt;1% was unclear, that the post-hoc evidence was insufficient to confirm whether there is a benefit in this group but that a benefit could not be excluded. The Subcommittee also stressed that treatment with durvalumab could expose patients who otherwise would not receive active treatment to potential toxicity.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that durvalumab maintenance would not replace any currently funded treatments and would be an additional cost, with vial sharing not feasible in all cases due to its short shelf life once opened, patient scheduling and patient numbers at each treatment centre. The Subcommittee considered that additional health resource would be required for durvalumab including fortnightly treatment administration, monthly clinical assessments, increased monitoring (eg three-monthly CT scans), and management of expected immune-related adverse events. The Subcommittee considered that fortnightly treatment may be challenging for rural patients and those in high deprivation areas. </p><p>Specific advice sought from CaTSoP by PTAC regarding durvalumab</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no evidence for maintenance treatment using other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (eg atezolizumab, pembrolizumab) to inform assessment of a possible class effect of these agents in the first-line maintenance setting. The Subcommittee noted that no other studies currently investigate this approach in the same patient population, and that the Keynote-799 trial of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC includes a different group of patients with advanced disease. The Subcommittee considered that over time it was likely that a class effect would be observed for the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in this setting, as has been observed in other treatment settings.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 100 patients per year (without a year 1 bolus due to commencing within 6 weeks after chemoradiation) could be eligible for durvalumab, if funded for first-line maintenance treatment of unresectable NSCLC, and considered that a funded treatment duration of 12 months was appropriate given the evidence for this treatment period.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Special Authority criteria for durvalumab first-line maintenance for NSCLC should require three-monthly renewal, due to the high cost of the medicine to ensure appropriate monitoring and use, and considered that treatment with durvalumab should stop at signs of progression. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that Special Authority criteria requiring PD-L1 testing and positivity would be reasonable to target funded treatment to those who would receive the greatest benefit, if required to appropriately control pharmaceutical expenditure, noting the health system costs and challenges associated with PD-L1 testing and the uncertain benefit in patients with PD-L1 &lt;1%.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, if maintenance treatment with durvalumab were funded for unresectable NSCLC, the funding criteria for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for metastatic NSCLC should be amended to exclude their use in patients who experienced disease progression on PD-L1 treatment, as there is insufficient evidence of benefits of re-treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor beyond progression.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that a very small number of patients may experience immune-related adverse events with durvalumab (eg. diarrhoea or colitis) that require subsequent treatment with a biologic treatment (eg. infliximab) and additional hospital visits for management of toxicity.</p>",
