The Subcommittee noted that the study was intended to determine if patients with untreated CLL would generate a greater immune response from vaccination with PCV13 compared with PPV23, for most serotypes common to both vaccines. The trial demonstrated a better immune response to PCV13 than PPV23 in 10/12 serotypes one month after vaccination and in 5/12 serotypes six months after vaccination.

The review noted that in the absence of agreed international guidelines, several national bodies have recommended infection prophylaxis in specific circumstances. The Subcommittee noted that this would include offering up to three doses of PPV23 for patients who have already received one dose of PCV13.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Subcommittee considered a clinical practice guideline from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines Committee (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26314781\" target=\"_blank\">Eichhorst et al. Ann Onc 2015;26 Suppl 5:v78-84</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the guideline considers that infections are a common complication in CLL patients following treatment with immunosuppressive agents. The guideline recommended pneumococcal vaccination in early-stage CLL, but did not specify the vaccine type or pneumococcal serotypes covered.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for benefit from vaccination with PCV13 followed by PPV23 was of poor quality and low strength, consisting of small observational studies and international guideline recommendations. The Subcommittee considered that the above Svensson et al. 2018 trial demonstrated a good immune response to PCV13, but did not provide evidence of additional benefit for subsequent vaccination with PPV23. The Subcommittee considered that there is a theoretical benefit to broadening immune response to more serotypes with PPV23, but this is not supported by the evidence at this time. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence did not support amending the eligibility criteria for PPV23 with respect to immunosuppression to be aligned with those for PCV13.\u00a0</p>",
