recommendations were based on considerations that: improved adherence with a polypill may not necessarily result in a decrease in health inequity for Māori and Pacific patients; polypills attract reduced pharmacy dispensing charges upon receiving only one pill rather than three separate pills, which may influence whether the medication is more likely to be collected from the pharmacy, potentially leading to improved self-reported adherence; challenges of use of fixed dose combination polypills compared with individual component pills including difficulty in determining a specific agent responsible for causing an adverse effect; the inability to tailor and titrate treatments to specific patient needs, and the risk of some patients being over-prescribed certain agents due to their presence in a fixed dose combination pill. </p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee also noted that previous considerations were based on evidence using surrogate outcome measures, which the Committee placed less weight on given the known generic limitations and potential inappropriateness of surrogates when trying to define the extent that incremental treatment effects are clinically meaningful. The Committee noted that previously PTAC compared the aggregate cost of the individual treatments with the cost of these treatments in a single pill (a polypill) and considered that when the cost of the polypill is greater, the health outcomes of spending this additional amount should be clear and supported by evidence. The Committee noted that PTAC also previously considered that polypills may be used widely to treat people who are at low and medium risk of cardiovascular disease, and that the evidence reviewed did not demonstrate that there a clear health benefit in these populations.</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the applicant provided additional information in support of their resubmission relating to equity considerations: </p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1600177?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"" target=""_blank"">Yusuf et al.
