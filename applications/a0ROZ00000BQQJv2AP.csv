The Subcommittee\xa0noted that overall survival data were immature at the time of interim analysis. The\xa0Subcommittee considered that based on currently available evidence it appeared there\xa0was a lower level of benefit from use of palbociclib in a second-line setting as compared\xa0to as a first-line endocrine therapy.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomized, phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial,\xa0which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in\xa0premenopausal women with advanced HR-positive breast cancer (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902"" target=""_blank"">Tripathy et al. Lancet\xa0Oncol. 2018;19:904-915</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ribociclib is another CDK4/6\xa0inhibitor, and that the results of MONALEESA supported that ribociclib plus endocrine\xa0therapy improved PFS compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were other CDK4/6 inhibitors in late-stage\xa0development and considered that, based on the currently available evidence, there\xa0appeared to be a class effect in terms of similar response rates and improved PFS from\xa0CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR-positive breast cancer. The Subcommittee noted it was interested\xa0to review further CDK4/6 data as it became available.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that survival data for all agents under development appeared\xa0not to be powered for OS; however, the Subcommittee considered that PFS is an\xa0adequate endpoint in this population, and noted the findings of a recent report published\xa0by The National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Steering Committee which identified that\xa0PFS is the preferred endpoint for trials investigating first- or second-line treatment for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.

The Subcommittee noted that this excluded patients rendered\xa0postmenopausal through the use of luteinizing-hormone-release hormone (LHRH)\xa0agonists. The Subcommittee considered that these patients also have the potential to\xa0benefit from treatment with palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and\xa0considered that the evidence provided by the PALOMA-3 trial (which included\xa0pre/perimenopausal patients receiving goserelin) supports this. The Subcommittee\xa0considered that patients rendered postmenopausal through the use of LHRH agonists\xa0should be included in the Special Authority criteria based on extrapolation of the\xa0PALOMA-3 data. Members considered that an additional 10-15% of patients may undergo\xa0this type of hormonal manipulation with LHRH agonists to access palbociclib, however\xa0given the demographics of the breast cancer population this would likely be limited to only\xa0younger patients with high risk disease.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated\xa0the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in the second-line, were\xa0promising however, considered the data is currently immature and should be reviewed\xa0once mature published data becomes available. The Subcommittee considered that, while\xa0fulvestrant was not currently funded in New Zealand, if fulvestrant were to be Medsafe\xa0approved and both agents were listed on the Schedule, that the Special Authority criteria\xa0for palbociclib should be reconsidered.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib was adversely\xa0affected by the relatively high price being sought by the supplier.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that overall there was reasonable evidence of a modest\xa0effect from the use of palbociclib in combination with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor\xa0as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative\xa0locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Subcommittee noted that approximately 3000 women are diagnosed with breast\xa0cancer each year in New Zealand, that an unknown proportion will progress from localized\xa0to advanced disease, and that approximately 20% of patients will have locally advanced\xa0or metastatic disease at diagnosis.

The Subcommittee noted that this excluded patients rendered\xa0postmenopausal through the use of luteinizing-hormone-release hormone (LHRH)\xa0agonists. The Subcommittee considered that these patients also have the potential to\xa0benefit from treatment with palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and\xa0considered that the evidence provided by the PALOMA-3 trial (which included\xa0pre/perimenopausal patients receiving goserelin) supports this. The Subcommittee\xa0considered that patients rendered postmenopausal through the use of LHRH agonists\xa0should be included in the Special Authority criteria based on extrapolation of the\xa0PALOMA-3 data. Members considered that an additional 10-15% of patients may undergo\xa0this type of hormonal manipulation with LHRH agonists to access palbociclib, however\xa0given the demographics of the breast cancer population this would likely be limited to only\xa0younger patients with high risk disease.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated\xa0the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in the second-line, were\xa0promising however, considered the data is currently immature and should be reviewed\xa0once mature published data becomes available.

The Subcommittee noted that the median PFS was\xa010.8 months in patients receiving palbociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 6.5\xa0months in patients receiving palbociclib alone. The Subcommittee considered that this\xa0indicates that palbociclib may have clinical activity in patients who have previously\xa0received endocrine therapy; however, these results are exploratory at this stage.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomised, phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which\xa0investigated the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant compared with\xa0placebo plus fulvestrant in 521 women with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer\xa0who had relapsed during prior endocrine therapy <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030518"" target=""_blank"">(Turner et al. N Engl J Med.\xa02015;373:209-219</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the patient population included premenopausal/ perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and that the former\xa0received goserelin for the duration of the study.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial demonstrated that\xa0palbociclib combined with fulvestrant appeared to provide a PFS benefit compared with\xa0fulvestrant alone in patients who had received prior endocrine therapy. The Subcommittee\xa0noted that overall survival data were immature at the time of interim analysis. The\xa0Subcommittee considered that based on currently available evidence it appeared there\xa0was a lower level of benefit from use of palbociclib in a second-line setting as compared\xa0to as a first-line endocrine therapy.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the double-blind, randomized, phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial,\xa0which investigated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy in\xa0premenopausal women with advanced HR-positive breast cancer (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804902"" target=""_blank"">Tripathy et al. Lancet\xa0Oncol. 2018;19:904-915</a>). The Subcommittee noted that ribociclib is another CDK4/6\xa0inhibitor, and that the results of MONALEESA supported that ribociclib plus endocrine\xa0therapy improved PFS compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were other CDK4/6 inhibitors in late-stage\xa0development and considered that, based on the currently available evidence, there\xa0appeared to be a class effect in terms of similar response rates and improved PFS from\xa0CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR-positive breast cancer. The Subcommittee noted it was interested\xa0to review further CDK4/6 data as it became available.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that survival data for all agents under development appeared\xa0not to be powered for OS; however, the Subcommittee considered that PFS is an\xa0adequate endpoint in this population, and noted the findings of a recent report published\xa0by The National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Steering Committee which identified that\xa0PFS is the preferred endpoint for trials investigating first- or second-line treatment for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30212295/"" target=""_blank"">Seidman et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018;JCO1800242</a>).\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the eligibility criteria for PALOMA 2 required women to be\xa0postmenopausal, defined by having undergone prior bilateral oophorectomy,\xa0spontaneous cessation of menses for 12 consecutive months or more, or having follicle-stimulating hormone and oestradiol levels in postmenopausal ranges without an\xa0alternative cause. The Subcommittee noted that this excluded patients rendered\xa0postmenopausal through the use of luteinizing-hormone-release hormone (LHRH)\xa0agonists. The Subcommittee considered that these patients also have the potential to\xa0benefit from treatment with palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and\xa0considered that the evidence provided by the PALOMA-3 trial (which included\xa0pre/perimenopausal patients receiving goserelin) supports this. The Subcommittee\xa0considered that patients rendered postmenopausal through the use of LHRH agonists\xa0should be included in the Special Authority criteria based on extrapolation of the\xa0PALOMA-3 data. Members considered that an additional 10-15% of patients may undergo\xa0this type of hormonal manipulation with LHRH agonists to access palbociclib, however\xa0given the demographics of the breast cancer population this would likely be limited to only\xa0younger patients with high risk disease.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the results of the PALOMA-3 trial, which investigated\xa0the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in the second-line, were\xa0promising however, considered the data is currently immature and should be reviewed\xa0once mature published data becomes available. The Subcommittee considered that, while\xa0fulvestrant was not currently funded in New Zealand, if fulvestrant were to be Medsafe\xa0approved and both agents were listed on the Schedule, that the Special Authority criteria\xa0for palbociclib should be reconsidered.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib was adversely\xa0affected by the relatively high price being sought by the supplier.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Subcommittee considered that overall there was reasonable evidence of a modest\xa0effect from the use of palbociclib in combination

The Committee noted there were no between-arm differences\xa0in breast-cancer specific quality of life functional domains or breast or arm symptoms as\xa0measured using the EORTC QLQ-BR23 instrument; and that there was a delay in\xa0deterioration in global QoL in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with the\xa0placebo plus fulvestrant group.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee agreed with CaTSoP’s conclusion that there is a significant health need\xa0for women with previously treated HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC, and that PALOMA-3 provides good quality evidence that palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant provides\xa0a clinically meaningful PFS benefit in this setting.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><i><u>General\xa0</u></i></p><p>The Committee noted the findings of three meta-analyses which investigated the\xa0benefits and risks associated with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054831"" target=""_blank"">Messina et al.

The Committee considered that these meta-analyses, in addition to\xa0the Committee’s review of the primary clinical trials of palbociclib and ribociclib, indicate\xa0that there is a class effect with the CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that the agents within this\xa0class can be considered to provide the same or similar therapeutic effect.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that in April 2019, CaTSoP reviewed the evidence available to\xa0date for the use of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib for the treatment of aBC\xa0(publication of minutes pending). The Committee noted that based on this CaTSoP\xa0considered there is a class effect with CDK4/6 inhibitors, and that there is likely to be no\xa0significant difference in which endocrine partner the CDK4/6 inhibitors are combined\xa0with.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there is no data available at this time regarding switching\xa0between CDK4/6 inhibitors or continuing the same CDK4/6 inhibitor but switching the\xa0endocrine partner at progression.

The Committee noted CaTSoP’s April 2019 discussion of the difficulties in\xa0assessing OS in disease such as HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer where\xa0patients have long survival times and receive multiple lines of treatment (CaTSoP April\xa02019 - publication of minutes pending).\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>\xa0The Committee noted that palbociclib plus fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of\xa0HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC has a score of 4 on the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical\xa0Benefit Scale; palbociclib or ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the first-line\xa0treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC have scores of 3 on the ESMO-Magnitude\xa0of Clinical Benefit Scale.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>\xa0The Committee considered that there is moderate quality evidence that palbociclib or\xa0ribociclib used in combination with an endocrine partner as a first-line treatment provides\xa0a modest improvement in PFS and maintains QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC. The Committee considered that while there are good quality Phase 3\xa0randomized controlled trials available, that the interpretation of results is limited by the\xa0</p><p>emphasis placed on PFS. The Committee considered that a composite analysis of PFS,\xa0OS, safety, and QoL data would strengthen the evidence base.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that there is good quality evidence that palbociclib in\xa0combination with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment provides a modest improvement\xa0in PFS with maintenance of QoL in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative aBC.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was uncertain whether the use of a CDK4/6 in a first or second-line setting would provide greater overall benefit for patients, as there was a\xa0lack of evidence to inform whether these agents altered tumour biology and/or the\xa0efficacy of subsequent treatments. The Committee considered it was likely that the use\xa0of a CDK4/6 inhibitor would alter prescriber behaviour for later line treatments.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that patients who have already progressed following one line\xa0of endocrine therapy have a higher health need than those who are treatment naïve due\xa0to a lack of alternative treatment options.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the Special Authority criteria previously recommended\xa0by CaTSoP for the first- and second-line use of CDK4/6 inhibitors are appropriate.\xa0</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000Arg5QAC'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Discussion': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Application': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'PTAC_Comments': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Outcome': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Links': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Formatted_Date': {'s': 'Oct 2019', 'fs': 'Oct 2019', 'change': None}, 'Event_Description': {'s': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'fs': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'change': None}, 'e': {'attributes': {'type': 'Application_Event__c', 'url': '/services/data/v65.0/sobjects/Application_Event__c/a0POZ00000R5Rhu2AF'}, 'Id': 'a0POZ00000R5Rhu2AF', 'Event_Date__c': '2019-10-18', 'Event_Description__c': 'Assigned to Cancer Treatments Subcommittee (CaTSoP) meeting to provide advice on Friday 18 October 2019', 'Stage__c': 'Seeking Clinical Advice', 'Formatted_Date__c': 'Oct 2019', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000CmvdQAC'}, 'change': None}, {'Summary': {'s': None, 'fs': None, 'change': None}, 'Published_Recommendation': {'s': '<p><span style=""color: black;"">1.1.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous recommendations that palbociclib as a first-line treatment in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and in combination with fulvestrant as a second line treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer be funded with medium priority subject to the same Special Authority criteria as previously recommended. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.2.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the different priority assigned to ribociclib and palbociclib was primarily due to differences in the quality of data currently available for these agents.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that based on currently available data there was a class effect from CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer and <b>recommended</b> funding for patients to receive one line of treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in either a first or second-line setting with high priority.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee reiterated its previous recommendation that the following Special Authority criteria be applied to funding of CDK4/6 inhibitors (note combined first-line and second-line criteria are shown below):</p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Special Authority for Subsidy – Retail Pharmacy</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Initial application -</span><b style=""font-size: 9pt;""> </b><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">only from a medical oncologist or </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">any other </span><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">medical practitioner on the recommendation of a medical oncologist.
