The Committee noted that the prevalence of CKD is greater among M\u0101ori compared with non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific populations. The Committee noted that the incidence rate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is 255 people per million among M\u0101ori.\u00a0The Committee noted M\u0101ori with kidney failure are significantly less likely to receive a kidney transplant and the mortality rate for people with kidney failure was estimated to be 181 per million among M\u0101ori.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted M\u0101ori experience whakam\u0101 (<em>disempowerment and embarrassment</em>) due to delayed diagnosis, missed opportunities for preventive care and regret and self-blame. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also experience stigma associated with CKD, can have a multigenerational fear of dialysis and an awareness that clinicians are not aware of cultural considerations and values during decision-making for management of CKD.</p><h2><em>Impact on Pacific peoples, disabled people, t\u0101ngata whaikaha M\u0101ori, and people who have been underserved by the health system</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed the impact of funding empagliflozin for the treatment of non-diabetic CKD on Pacific peoples and noted that the prevalence of CKD is greater in Pacific peoples compared with non-Pacific peoples and non-M\u0101ori individuals. The Committee noted that the incidence rate for ESKD is 340 people per million for Pacific peoples, no renal transplants were received by Pacific peoples in 2020, and the mortality rate for kidney failure was estimated to be 242 per million among Pacific peoples.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was a lack of evidence to assess the impact of CKD among disabled people, t\u0101ngata whaikaha M\u0101ori and people who have been underserved by the health system. The Committee considered that groups in the community who experienced inequitable access to primary care were less likely to receive screening and other appropriate care for the management of CKD.</p><h2><em>Health need</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CKD is an irreversible long-term condition that adversely affects the kidney structure and function, compromising the kidneys\u2019 ability to filter toxins from the blood and excrete waste products via urine.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the severity of CKD can be determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which indicates the level of kidney function or by the presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria), indicating the level of kidney damage. The Committee noted the funding application for empagliflozin for non-diabetic kidney disease was for people with mild to moderate CKD with macroalbuminuria (&gt;20 mg/mmol) and for people with moderate to severe CKD.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, especially in the earliest stages, CKD often remains underdiagnosed because the initial decline in kidney function can be asymptomatic. The Committee noted that the complications of CKD included volume overload, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anaemia, and mineral and bone disorders. The Committee noted that although symptoms can be managed with medications and other clinical interventions, the decline in kidney function associated with CKD is irreversible and usually inexorable.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the rate of progression of CKD from one major stage to another varies based upon the underlying disease, presence of comorbid conditions, the available treatments, socioeconomic status, individual genetics, ethnicity, and other factors. The Committee noted that the intent of treatment of CKD is to slow the rate of progression and thereby delay or prevent individuals from developing ESKD and requiring renal replacement therapies such as dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the global prevalence of CKD is estimated to be between 11-13%. The Committee noted it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals with non-diabetic CKD in New Zealand as the disease is initially asymptomatic and screening rates for the condition are highly variable across the country. The Committee noted two regional New Zealand studies which estimated the prevalence of CKD to be 13% and 11.8%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al.

The Committee noted a clinic-based observational study conducted among individuals registered at two Pacific health providers in Auckland, which reported that in 2017 the prevalence of CKD was 10.4% for M\u0101ori participants compared to 7.1% of non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific participants (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al. 2022</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in the Southland region in 2014, the prevalence of CKD among Pacific peoples was higher compared to New Zealand Europeans (aOR=2.62 [95% 2.28 to 3.01]) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717528/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd 2019</a>).

The Committee noted that internationally there were three formulae used to estimate GFR: the Cockcroft and Gault formula, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. These formulae were developed from predominantly European populations and that the CKD-EPI equation included a race coefficient of 1.212, and that this multiplier was applied to individuals identified as African American. The Committee noted that this coefficient was based on false notions of African Americans having higher lean mass than people of other ethnicities.

The Committee considered that such a short length of follow-up in the trial meant that the longer-term trajectory of these outcomes would need to be extrapolated from limited clinical data, introducing uncertainty in the Committee\u2019s assessment of the ultimate likely treatment benefit associated with empagliflozin. The Committee considered this would especially be the case for understanding the benefits associated with empagliflozin among individuals with earlier stage CKD, who were likely to be on treatment for longer and could potentially experience the greatest delays in time to requiring either additional care for CKD complications or renal replacement therapies.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would provide a health benefit to family, wh\u0101nau and wider society, by slowing the progression of CKD and in turn delaying the need for individuals to receive renal replacement therapy or treatment for CKD-related complications. The Committee considered that this may improve the health-related quality of life of family and wh\u0101nau, by reducing the burden of care associated with dialysis or hospital admissions.</p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that empagliflozin is an oral medication that is administered once daily, in addition to other community funded medications.

The Committee considered that rates of eGFR and uACR testing in primary care would increase if access to empagliflozin were to be widened, as primary care clinicians would be encouraged to screen high-risk individuals for CKD to see if they are eligible for empagliflozin. The Committee considered that a whole-of-system approach was needed to support screening for CKD in primary care and equitable uptake of empagliflozin, particularly for M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and other groups disproportionately impacted by CKD. The Committee considered there is a risk that, despite strong initial uptake, persistence might wane due to the asymptomatic nature of CKD for many people and that prescriber education, follow-up mechanisms and consumer awareness of the importance of remaining on treatment would also be important.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that funding empagliflozin for CKD may slow the rate at which individuals progress to requiring renal replacement therapies such as dialysis.

The Committee noted that internationally there were three formulae used to estimate GFR: the Cockcroft and Gault formula, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. These formulae were developed from predominantly European populations and that the CKD-EPI equation included a race coefficient of 1.212, and that this multiplier was applied to individuals identified as African American. The Committee noted that this coefficient was based on false notions of African Americans having higher lean mass than people of other ethnicities. The Committee noted a growing body of validation studies of eGFR formulae which support the view that there is no biological or other basis to include race-based or ethnicity-based criteria in these formulae.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a race-adjusted CKD-EPI formula was used to determine trial eligibility in EMPA-KIDNEY and that internationally either the CKD-EPI or the MDRD were most commonly used to calculate eGFR.

The Committee noted that pre-2021 versions of the MDRD included a waist circumference criterion, causing the formula to artificially overstate the eGFR among people of ethnicities with higher average waist circumferences such as M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and other people of non-European ethnicity. The Committee considered that this systemic bias in the way eGFR was calculated has resulted in historic harm to these groups, noting that many could have been denied appropriate care because their renal function was being overstated by the MDRD.\u00a0</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) which is found in the proximal tubules in the kidneys.

The Committee considered that such a short length of follow-up in the trial meant that the longer-term trajectory of these outcomes would need to be extrapolated from limited clinical data, introducing uncertainty in the Committee\u2019s assessment of the ultimate likely treatment benefit associated with empagliflozin. The Committee considered this would especially be the case for understanding the benefits associated with empagliflozin among individuals with earlier stage CKD, who were likely to be on treatment for longer and could potentially experience the greatest delays in time to requiring either additional care for CKD complications or renal replacement therapies.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would provide a health benefit to family, wh\u0101nau and wider society, by slowing the progression of CKD and in turn delaying the need for individuals to receive renal replacement therapy or treatment for CKD-related complications.

The Committee considered that rates of eGFR and uACR testing in primary care would increase if access to empagliflozin were to be widened, as primary care clinicians would be encouraged to screen high-risk individuals for CKD to see if they are eligible for empagliflozin. The Committee considered that a whole-of-system approach was needed to support screening for CKD in primary care and equitable uptake of empagliflozin, particularly for M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and other groups disproportionately impacted by CKD.

The Committee noted that the prevalence of CKD is greater among M\u0101ori compared with non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific populations. The Committee noted that the incidence rate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is 255 people per million among M\u0101ori.\u00a0The Committee noted M\u0101ori with kidney failure are significantly less likely to receive a kidney transplant and the mortality rate for people with kidney failure was estimated to be 181 per million among M\u0101ori.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted M\u0101ori experience whakam\u0101 (<em>disempowerment and embarrassment</em>) due to delayed diagnosis, missed opportunities for preventive care and regret and self-blame. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also experience stigma associated with CKD, can have a multigenerational fear of dialysis and an awareness that clinicians are not aware of cultural considerations and values during decision-making for management of CKD.</p><h2><em>Impact on Pacific peoples, disabled people, t\u0101ngata whaikaha M\u0101ori, and people who have been underserved by the health system</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee discussed the impact of funding empagliflozin for the treatment of non-diabetic CKD on Pacific peoples and noted that the prevalence of CKD is greater in Pacific peoples compared with non-Pacific peoples and non-M\u0101ori individuals. The Committee noted that the incidence rate for ESKD is 340 people per million for Pacific peoples, no renal transplants were received by Pacific peoples in 2020, and the mortality rate for kidney failure was estimated to be 242 per million among Pacific peoples.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was a lack of evidence to assess the impact of CKD among disabled people, t\u0101ngata whaikaha M\u0101ori and people who have been underserved by the health system. The Committee considered that groups in the community who experienced inequitable access to primary care were less likely to receive screening and other appropriate care for the management of CKD.</p><h2><em>Health need</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CKD is an irreversible long-term condition that adversely affects the kidney structure and function, compromising the kidneys\u2019 ability to filter toxins from the blood and excrete waste products via urine.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the severity of CKD can be determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which indicates the level of kidney function or by the presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria), indicating the level of kidney damage. The Committee noted the funding application for empagliflozin for non-diabetic kidney disease was for people with mild to moderate CKD with macroalbuminuria (&gt;20 mg/mmol) and for people with moderate to severe CKD.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, especially in the earliest stages, CKD often remains underdiagnosed because the initial decline in kidney function can be asymptomatic. The Committee noted that the complications of CKD included volume overload, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anaemia, and mineral and bone disorders. The Committee noted that although symptoms can be managed with medications and other clinical interventions, the decline in kidney function associated with CKD is irreversible and usually inexorable.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the rate of progression of CKD from one major stage to another varies based upon the underlying disease, presence of comorbid conditions, the available treatments, socioeconomic status, individual genetics, ethnicity, and other factors. The Committee noted that the intent of treatment of CKD is to slow the rate of progression and thereby delay or prevent individuals from developing ESKD and requiring renal replacement therapies such as dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the global prevalence of CKD is estimated to be between 11-13%. The Committee noted it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals with non-diabetic CKD in New Zealand as the disease is initially asymptomatic and screening rates for the condition are highly variable across the country. The Committee noted two regional New Zealand studies which estimated the prevalence of CKD to be 13% and 11.8%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al.

The Committee noted a clinic-based observational study conducted among individuals registered at two Pacific health providers in Auckland, which reported that in 2017 the prevalence of CKD was 10.4% for M\u0101ori participants compared to 7.1% of non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific participants (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al. 2022</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that, in the Southland region in 2014, the prevalence of CKD among Pacific peoples was higher compared to New Zealand Europeans (aOR=2.62 [95% 2.28 to 3.01]) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717528/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd 2019</a>). The Committee noted that, based on a clinic-based observational study, the prevalence of CKD among Pacific peoples was estimated to be between 15.5 and 21.8 % in 2017, with some variation between different Pacific ethnicities (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al. 2022</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in 2020, there were 3,004 individuals receiving renal replacement therapy in New Zealand and that this number has grown over time.

The Committee noted that internationally there were three formulae used to estimate GFR: the Cockcroft and Gault formula, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. These formulae were developed from predominantly European populations and that the CKD-EPI equation included a race coefficient of 1.212, and that this multiplier was applied to individuals identified as African American. The Committee noted that this coefficient was based on false notions of African Americans having higher lean mass than people of other ethnicities. The Committee noted a growing body of validation studies of eGFR formulae which support the view that there is no biological or other basis to include race-based or ethnicity-based criteria in these formulae.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a race-adjusted CKD-EPI formula was used to determine trial eligibility in EMPA-KIDNEY and that internationally either the CKD-EPI or the MDRD were most commonly used to calculate eGFR. The Committee noted that the Cockcroft and Gault formula had fallen out of favour in recent years as it was less reliable in predicting GFR compared to the other two formulae.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that in New Zealand, most laboratories use the MDRD to estimate GFR. The Committee noted that pre-2021 versions of the MDRD included a waist circumference criterion, causing the formula to artificially overstate the eGFR among people of ethnicities with higher average waist circumferences such as M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and other people of non-European ethnicity. The Committee considered that this systemic bias in the way eGFR was calculated has resulted in historic harm to these groups, noting that many could have been denied appropriate care because their renal function was being overstated by the MDRD.\u00a0</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) which is found in the proximal tubules in the kidneys. Empagliflozin prevents renal reabsorption of glucose, resulting in improvement glycaemic control. The Committee noted that individuals require adequate renal function to initiate empagliflozin.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36331190/\" target=\"_blank\">EMPA-Kidney</a> trial in which 6609 individuals with CKD were randomised to receive empagliflozin or placebo as an add-on to their standard treatment of care; 54% of individuals had non-diabetic CKD. There were 432 participants (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and 558 participants (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.82; P&lt;0.001) experienced the primary composite outcome of sustained decline of &gt;40% in eGFR, onset of ESKD or death due to renal or cardiovascular causes. Hospitalisations due to any cause were experienced at rates of 24.8 hospitalisations per 100 patient years for individuals receiving empagliflozin and 29.2 hospitalisations per 100 patient years for individuals receiving placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, P=0.003). Progression of kidney disease was experienced by 384 (11.6%) of individuals receiving empagliflozin and 504 (15.2%) individuals receiving placebo. 59 (1.8%) individuals receiving empagliflozin and 69 (2.1%) of individuals receiving placebo (HR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.19) died due to cardiovascular causes during the trial.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33338413/\" target=\"_blank\">DAPA-CKD</a> trial in which 4304 individuals with CKD were randomised to receive dapagliflozin or placebo as an add-on to their standard treatment of care, 32.5% of individuals had non-diabetic CKD. Irrespective of diabetes status, the event rate for the primary outcome (defined as: sustained decline of &gt;50% in eGFR, onset of ESKD or death due to renal or cardiovascular causes) was lower in the dapagliflozin group, (5.2 events per 100 patient-years) compared to the placebo group (8.0 events per 100 patient-years); the HR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.52\u20130.79). There was no significant interaction between diabetes status and the primary composite outcome (P<sub>interaction</sub>=0.24). For participants without diabetes, the event rate for the primary outcome was also lower in the dapagliflozin group (3.4 events per 100 patient-years) than in the placebo group (6.3 events per 100 patient-years); the HR was 0\u00b750 (0\u00b735\u20130\u00b772). For participants without diabetes ESKD was experienced at rates of 2.4 events per 100 patient-years for individuals receiving dapagliflozin and 3.9 events per 100-patient years for individuals receiving placebo (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.36-0.87]). For participants without diabetes eGFR declining to &lt; 15 mL/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup> was experienced at rates of 2.0 events per 100 patient-years for individuals receiving dapagliflozin and 3.2 events per 100-patient years for individuals receiving placebo (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.35-0.91]). Individuals without diabetes requiring chronic dialysis was experienced at a rate of 1.5 events per 100 patient-years for individuals receiving dapagliflozin and 2.1 events per 100-patient years for individuals receiving placebo (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.36-1.09]).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review and meta-analysis in which 90,409 individuals with CKD including 15,605 (17.3%) without diabetes received an SGLT inhibitor. The study reported that the risk of kidney disease progression was reduced for those treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo by 37% (relative risk [RR] 0\u00b763, 95% CI 0\u00b758\u20130\u00b769) with similar RR in patients with and without diabetes. In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RR were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0\u00b777, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b784) and the risk of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation or heart failure by 23% (0\u00b777, 95% CI 0\u00b774\u20130\u00b781), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0\u00b786, 95% CI 0\u00b781\u20130\u00b792) but did not significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (0\u00b794, 95% CI 0\u00b788\u20131\u00b702). For these mortality outcomes, RR were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of what the individuals eGFR was prior to starting the trial. Based on estimates of absolute effects, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibition outweighed any serious hazards of ketoacidosis or amputation (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36351458/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuffield Department of Population Health Renal Studies Group and SGLT2 inhibitor Meta-analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists\u2019 Consortium.

The Committee considered that dapagliflozin may be slightly more efficacious than empagliflozin and canagliflozin, based on the available evidence. The Committee considered however that differences in reported efficacy between SGLT2 inhibitor trials could have been driven by differences in baseline characteristics of trial participants.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the evidence to support use of empagliflozin in CKD to be of high quality and moderate strength. The Committee noted that EMPA-KIDNEY reported broadly similar magnitudes of reduced kidney disease progression associated with empagliflozin among different subgroups of different eGFR status and diabetes status.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the EMPA-KIDNEY had a median follow-up duration of two years and noted that some of the secondary outcomes the trial reported such as cardiovascular mortality occur over timescales much longer than this. The Committee considered that such a short length of follow-up in the trial meant that the longer-term trajectory of these outcomes would need to be extrapolated from limited clinical data, introducing uncertainty in the Committee\u2019s assessment of the ultimate likely treatment benefit associated with empagliflozin. The Committee considered this would especially be the case for understanding the benefits associated with empagliflozin among individuals with earlier stage CKD, who were likely to be on treatment for longer and could potentially experience the greatest delays in time to requiring either additional care for CKD complications or renal replacement therapies.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that empagliflozin would provide a health benefit to family, wh\u0101nau and wider society, by slowing the progression of CKD and in turn delaying the need for individuals to receive renal replacement therapy or treatment for CKD-related complications. The Committee considered that this may improve the health-related quality of life of family and wh\u0101nau, by reducing the burden of care associated with dialysis or hospital admissions.</p><h2><em>Suitability</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that empagliflozin is an oral medication that is administered once daily, in addition to other community funded medications. The Committee noted that funding empagliflozin may exacerbate issues relating to polypharmacy given many individuals will already have a considerable pill burden from medicines they are taking either for CKD or other comorbidities.</p><h2><em>Cost and savings</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there could be over 260,000 people in New Zealand with CKD, based on the 2014 prevalence of roughly 5% reported in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717528/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a>, and it was possible that in the intervening period that the prevalence had further increased from this level. The Committee considered that a large proportion of these individuals would be eligible for empagliflozin under the proposed access criteria.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that some individuals with CKD may have diabetes and be eligible for funded empagliflozin under current Special Authority criteria (i.e., HbA1c \u2265 53 mmol/ml despite three-month\u2019 trial of metformin, or metformin intolerance).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CKD testing rates were variable around New Zealand, with testing rates ranging from 40% to 70% reported in different publications (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717528/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698436/\" target=\"_blank\">Tafuna\u2019i et al. 2022</a>). The Committee considered that rates of eGFR and uACR testing in primary care would increase if access to empagliflozin were to be widened, as primary care clinicians would be encouraged to screen high-risk individuals for CKD to see if they are eligible for empagliflozin. The Committee considered that a whole-of-system approach was needed to support screening for CKD in primary care and equitable uptake of empagliflozin, particularly for M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and other groups disproportionately impacted by CKD. The Committee considered there is a risk that, despite strong initial uptake, persistence might wane due to the asymptomatic nature of CKD for many people and that prescriber education, follow-up mechanisms and consumer awareness of the importance of remaining on treatment would also be important.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that funding empagliflozin for CKD may slow the rate at which individuals progress to requiring renal replacement therapies such as dialysis. The Committee noted that dialysis and other renal replacement therapies were associated with very high costs to the health sector and delaying the time before people require such therapies could result in savings to the health sector.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a key component of the economic assessment of empagliflozin was the range of cardiovascular and survival health benefits that could be reasonably inferred from a reduced risk of kidney disease progression. The Committee noted that EMPA-KIDNEY reported a range of secondary outcomes, some of which could reasonably be expected to be associated with reduced CKD progression but none of the results for these endpoints were statistically significant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was reasonable to assume that a reduced risk of kidney disease progression would correspond to both a reduction in the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease and a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular mortality, and as such, these outcomes were appropriate to include in the PICO for economic assessment. The Committee noted that these outcomes occur over relatively long-time horizons, as such, it was unlikely that trial evidence would be available to inform the modelling of these endpoints.</p><h2><em>Funding criteria</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in Australia, the access criteria for dapagliflozin excluded individuals with polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis or ANCA-associated vasculitis. The Committee noted that the EMPA-KIDNEY trial excluded people with polycystic kidney disease. The Committee noted that people in New Zealand with polycystic kidney disease have a funded alternative in tolvaptan which reduces the long-term progression of the condition, however the Committee considered that people with polycystic kidney disease would still benefit from empagliflozin. The Committee considered that specific CKD conditions were not appropriate to exclude from the access criteria for empagliflozin in New Zealand.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that further advice should be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee on whether the proposed access criteria for empagliflozin could be amended to better target priority populations, and whether the proposed eGFR and uACR thresholds were clinically appropriate.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for empagliflozin if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CKD, without diabetes.
