The Committee noted that whilst there was no published evidence on the prevalence of the condition in M\u0101ori, approximately four of the 32 requests for access to sirolimus, for all indications, via the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) process were for M\u0101ori. The Committee noted access to medicines via the NPPA process may result in inequitable access due to the physician time and resource required for an application.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background</em></p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted its previous review (as the Dermatology Subcommittee) in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a> of an application for topical sirolimus consequent to NPPA applications for sirolimus ointment (rapamycin). That application involved a 0.1-1% ointment that was compounded by Optimus Healthcare compounding pharmacy. The Committee noted that the recommendation of deferral, subject to the outcome of a phase two study by Koenig et al on 177 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex associated facial angiofibromas treated with topical sirolimus (NCT01526356). This product was ranked in 2020. This application is now on the decline list due to the lack of a supplier, and the product not being able to be safely compounded in community pharmacy.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a further application for this pharmaceutical was received in January 2023, from a supplier for the same indication, but for a non-compounded product with a strength of 0.5%.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted it had previously reviewed the health need of those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted facial angiofibromas are the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex and are prevalent in 70-80% of those with the condition.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. It is a genetic multisystem disorder characterised by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of tuberous sclerosis complex is estimated at between 0.7 \u2013 8.8 per 100,000, and facial angiofibromas to be the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex which are prevalent in 70-80% of people with tuberous sclerosis complex. The Committee noted in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>, that there could be 399 individuals in New Zealand with tuberous sclerosis complex (based on a 2004 estimate), and of that number, there may be 40-80 individuals in New Zealand with moderate/significant facial angiofibromas, with an additional seven new cases per year.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex can experience frequent spontaneous and uncontrolled bleeding, and infections are common when the lesions are present around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Due to progressive growth, over time facial angiofibromas can impair vision and breathing, and have psychological consequences (emotional, social and self-image disorders), with uncontrolled growth potentially causing further cosmetic disfigurement (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al.

The CDLQI score of untreated individuals was 9.5 compared to 3.83 in those who had received treatment (p=0.001). Those who were not treated had a CDLQI score that represented a moderate effect on quality of life, whilst those treated had a small effect (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).The largest proportion of those who were treated had been recommended to use topical rapamycin (47.3%) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a US study provided by the supplier that reported gaps in the care for people with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. 41% of people reported never receiving treatment for facial angiofibromas even though 74.3% had visited a dermatologist, indicating many people are unable to receive treatment. The Committee considered that underdiagnosis may also influence access to treatment in New Zealand for those affected, with the condition being hard to diagnose.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is minimal access to dermabrasion or laser therapies in the public health system, these treatments must be self-funded by the individual at significant cost.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health need of those with facial angiofibromas was higher than those on the body due to increased prominence of the angiofibromas, and the ensuing greater cosmetic impact.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted sirolimus forms a complex which binds to and selectively inhibits mTORC1. The mTOR complex modulates aspects of the cell cycle, cell growth, proliferation and migration. mTORC1 inhibition reduces the dysregulated growth and differentiation observed in facial angiofibromas.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800048/\" target=\"_blank\">Koenig et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2018;154:773-80</a> study of 179 individuals randomised to control, 0.1% or 1% topical treatment for 6 months, applied once daily. At 6 months the Angiofibroma Grading Scale mean improvement for 1% sirolimus was 16.7 points vs 11.0 for 0.1% sirolimus vs 2.1 points for vehicle only (P &lt; .001 for 1% and 0.1% vs vehicle only). The Committee noted there were minimal adverse events. The Committee considered most improvement was observed in the first month of treatment, with most participants completing the trial.

This application is now on the decline list due to the lack of a supplier, and the product not being able to be safely compounded in community pharmacy.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a further application for this pharmaceutical was received in January 2023, from a supplier for the same indication, but for a non-compounded product with a strength of 0.5%.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted it had previously reviewed the health need of those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted facial angiofibromas are the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex and are prevalent in 70-80% of those with the condition.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. It is a genetic multisystem disorder characterised by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of tuberous sclerosis complex is estimated at between 0.7 \u2013 8.8 per 100,000, and facial angiofibromas to be the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex which are prevalent in 70-80% of people with tuberous sclerosis complex. The Committee noted in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>, that there could be 399 individuals in New Zealand with tuberous sclerosis complex (based on a 2004 estimate), and of that number, there may be 40-80 individuals in New Zealand with moderate/significant facial angiofibromas, with an additional seven new cases per year.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex can experience frequent spontaneous and uncontrolled bleeding, and infections are common when the lesions are present around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Due to progressive growth, over time facial angiofibromas can impair vision and breathing, and have psychological consequences (emotional, social and self-image disorders), with uncontrolled growth potentially causing further cosmetic disfigurement (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al.

The CDLQI score of untreated individuals was 9.5 compared to 3.83 in those who had received treatment (p=0.001). Those who were not treated had a CDLQI score that represented a moderate effect on quality of life, whilst those treated had a small effect (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).The largest proportion of those who were treated had been recommended to use topical rapamycin (47.3%) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a US study provided by the supplier that reported gaps in the care for people with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. 41% of people reported never receiving treatment for facial angiofibromas even though 74.3% had visited a dermatologist, indicating many people are unable to receive treatment. The Committee considered that underdiagnosis may also influence access to treatment in New Zealand for those affected, with the condition being hard to diagnose.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is minimal access to dermabrasion or laser therapies in the public health system, these treatments must be self-funded by the individual at significant cost.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health need of those with facial angiofibromas was higher than those on the body due to increased prominence of the angiofibromas, and the ensuing greater cosmetic impact.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted sirolimus forms a complex which binds to and selectively inhibits mTORC1. The mTOR complex modulates aspects of the cell cycle, cell growth, proliferation and migration. mTORC1 inhibition reduces the dysregulated growth and differentiation observed in facial angiofibromas.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800048/\" target=\"_blank\">Koenig et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2018;154:773-80</a> study of 179 individuals randomised to control, 0.1% or 1% topical treatment for 6 months, applied once daily. At 6 months the Angiofibroma Grading Scale mean improvement for 1% sirolimus was 16.7 points vs 11.0 for 0.1% sirolimus vs 2.1 points for vehicle only (P &lt; .001 for 1% and 0.1% vs vehicle only). The Committee noted there were minimal adverse events. The Committee considered most improvement was observed in the first month of treatment, with most participants completing the trial. The Committee noted there was no drug detected in the serum of individuals.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pharmconnect.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Application__c/a0S2P0000032osgUAA/view\" target=\"_blank\">Wataya-Kaneda et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2017;153:39-48</a> study that involved 36 people, of which 18 were children. Sirolimus gel concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% or placebo were applied twice daily for 12 weeks. The improvement factor was statistically significant in all active treatment groups receiving 0.2% sirolimus (mean [SD], 1.94 [0.68]; P &lt; .001) but not in the adult subgroups receiving 0.1% (mean [SD], 0.88 [0.85]; P = .31) and 0.05% (mean [SD], 1.63 [1.11]; P = .09) concentrations of sirolimus. No significant adverse effects were observed. The Committee considered that whilst the study was small, it was well designed.</p><p>11.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that low blood levels of sirolimus (&lt;0.25 ng/mL) were detected in adults (1 [25%] in 0.1% and 2 [50%] in 0.2%) and children (1 [25%] in 0.05%, 2 [50%] in 0.1%, and 4 [100%] in 0.2%). The Committee noted that the authors considered this may be due to the gel formulation being better absorbed than the ointment form.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800026/\" target=\"_blank\">Wataya-Kaneda et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2018;154:781-788</a> study of 62 people, of which 27 were children, who were received either 0.2% sirolimus gel (n=30) or placebo (n=32) applied twice daily for 12 weeks. The response rates of the angiofibromas at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of treatment was 20% (95% CI, 8%-39%; P = .01), 43% (95% CI, 26%-63%; P &lt; .001), and 60% (95% CI, 41%-77%; P &lt; .001) with sirolimus vs 0% in placebo group. 0/ 31 in placebo group were rated improved or better, and 26 (84%) were rated unchanged.

The Committee noted that whilst there was no published evidence on the prevalence of the condition in M\u0101ori, approximately four of the 32 requests for access to sirolimus, for all indications, via the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) process were for M\u0101ori. The Committee noted access to medicines via the NPPA process may result in inequitable access due to the physician time and resource required for an application.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Background</em></p><p>1.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted its previous review (as the Dermatology Subcommittee) in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a> of an application for topical sirolimus consequent to NPPA applications for sirolimus ointment (rapamycin). That application involved a 0.1-1% ointment that was compounded by Optimus Healthcare compounding pharmacy. The Committee noted that the recommendation of deferral, subject to the outcome of a phase two study by Koenig et al on 177 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex associated facial angiofibromas treated with topical sirolimus (NCT01526356). This product was ranked in 2020. This application is now on the decline list due to the lack of a supplier, and the product not being able to be safely compounded in community pharmacy.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a further application for this pharmaceutical was received in January 2023, from a supplier for the same indication, but for a non-compounded product with a strength of 0.5%.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health need</em></p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted it had previously reviewed the health need of those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted facial angiofibromas are the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex and are prevalent in 70-80% of those with the condition.</p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. It is a genetic multisystem disorder characterised by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver.</p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the prevalence of tuberous sclerosis complex is estimated at between 0.7 \u2013 8.8 per 100,000, and facial angiofibromas to be the most common presentation in tuberous sclerosis complex which are prevalent in 70-80% of people with tuberous sclerosis complex. The Committee noted in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2015-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015</a>, that there could be 399 individuals in New Zealand with tuberous sclerosis complex (based on a 2004 estimate), and of that number, there may be 40-80 individuals in New Zealand with moderate/significant facial angiofibromas, with an additional seven new cases per year.</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted those with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex can experience frequent spontaneous and uncontrolled bleeding, and infections are common when the lesions are present around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Due to progressive growth, over time facial angiofibromas can impair vision and breathing, and have psychological consequences (emotional, social and self-image disorders), with uncontrolled growth potentially causing further cosmetic disfigurement (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al.

The CDLQI score of untreated individuals was 9.5 compared to 3.83 in those who had received treatment (p=0.001). Those who were not treated had a CDLQI score that represented a moderate effect on quality of life, whilst those treated had a small effect (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).The largest proportion of those who were treated had been recommended to use topical rapamycin (47.3%) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436143/#:~:text=Abstract,leading%20to%20negative%20psychosocial%20outcomes.\" target=\"_blank\">Crall et al. 2016</a>).</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a US study provided by the supplier that reported gaps in the care for people with facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. 41% of people reported never receiving treatment for facial angiofibromas even though 74.3% had visited a dermatologist, indicating many people are unable to receive treatment. The Committee considered that underdiagnosis may also influence access to treatment in New Zealand for those affected, with the condition being hard to diagnose.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is minimal access to dermabrasion or laser therapies in the public health system, these treatments must be self-funded by the individual at significant cost.</p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the health need of those with facial angiofibromas was higher than those on the body due to increased prominence of the angiofibromas, and the ensuing greater cosmetic impact.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Health benefit</em></p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted sirolimus forms a complex which binds to and selectively inhibits mTORC1. The mTOR complex modulates aspects of the cell cycle, cell growth, proliferation and migration. mTORC1 inhibition reduces the dysregulated growth and differentiation observed in facial angiofibromas.</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800048/\" target=\"_blank\">Koenig et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2018;154:773-80</a> study of 179 individuals randomised to control, 0.1% or 1% topical treatment for 6 months, applied once daily. At 6 months the Angiofibroma Grading Scale mean improvement for 1% sirolimus was 16.7 points vs 11.0 for 0.1% sirolimus vs 2.1 points for vehicle only (P &lt; .001 for 1% and 0.1% vs vehicle only). The Committee noted there were minimal adverse events. The Committee considered most improvement was observed in the first month of treatment, with most participants completing the trial. The Committee noted there was no drug detected in the serum of individuals.</p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pharmconnect.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Application__c/a0S2P0000032osgUAA/view\" target=\"_blank\">Wataya-Kaneda et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2017;153:39-48</a> study that involved 36 people, of which 18 were children. Sirolimus gel concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% or placebo were applied twice daily for 12 weeks. The improvement factor was statistically significant in all active treatment groups receiving 0.2% sirolimus (mean [SD], 1.94 [0.68]; P &lt; .001) but not in the adult subgroups receiving 0.1% (mean [SD], 0.88 [0.85]; P = .31) and 0.05% (mean [SD], 1.63 [1.11]; P = .09) concentrations of sirolimus. No significant adverse effects were observed. The Committee considered that whilst the study was small, it was well designed.</p><p>11.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that low blood levels of sirolimus (&lt;0.25 ng/mL) were detected in adults (1 [25%] in 0.1% and 2 [50%] in 0.2%) and children (1 [25%] in 0.05%, 2 [50%] in 0.1%, and 4 [100%] in 0.2%). The Committee noted that the authors considered this may be due to the gel formulation being better absorbed than the ointment form.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800026/\" target=\"_blank\">Wataya-Kaneda et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2018;154:781-788</a> study of 62 people, of which 27 were children, who were received either 0.2% sirolimus gel (n=30) or placebo (n=32) applied twice daily for 12 weeks. The response rates of the angiofibromas at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of treatment was 20% (95% CI, 8%-39%; P = .01), 43% (95% CI, 26%-63%; P &lt; .001), and 60% (95% CI, 41%-77%; P &lt; .001) with sirolimus vs 0% in placebo group. 0/ 31 in placebo group were rated improved or better, and 26 (84%) were rated unchanged.
