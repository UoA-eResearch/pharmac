The Subcommittee noted that on average, people with schizophrenia often die 10 years earlier than the general population, often through cardiovascular mortality.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted there are currently 13 oral and six depot antipsychotic agents funded. The Subcommittee considered that while there are a number of treatment options, the available agents are limited by side effects - mainly extrapyramidal and metabolic. Members noted the substantial impacts. The Subcommittee considered that there are issues in access to these pharmaceuticals, particularly in regard to adherence related to intolerable side effects. The Subcommittee considered that adherence was likely to differ between patient subpopulations, with those with poor insight and/or motivation (likeliest to be features of the underlying disease itself) more prone to nonadherence.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered, given the side effect profile of currently available treatments there is a considerable side-effect burden on patients. The Subcommittee noted that Māori and Pacific people have higher rates of schizophrenia than the general population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that while schizophrenia treatment rates between Māori and non-Māori are generally comparable, there is a significant issue with Māori presenting more in acute settings through inpatient services, presenting substantially more unwell and receiving treatment later than the general schizophrenia population. Members considered that while this is unlikely to impact the net result of treatment, it is far from ideal as early recognition and intervention may prevent some of the acute outcomes.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that compared with treatment received by the general schizophrenia population in New Zealand, there is currently a high rate of clozapine use in Māori for a variety of reasons, but generally associated with the higher rate of acute presentation. However, that this higher clozapine use in Māori is aligned more closely with international treatment guidelines for schizophrenia. 5 Members considered that, anecdotally, Māori have higher rates of treatment resistant schizophrenia than the general NZ population.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that a number of people receive treatment with antipsychotics under the Mental Health Act. The Subcommittee considered that with currently funded treatments, this means that many patients experience a number of comorbidities and adverse effects resulting from treatment, in circumstances where patients are obliged to accept compulsory treatment.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a comparative study on the effect of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860457/"" target=""_blank"">Pillinger et al. Lancet Psych. 2020;7:64-77</a>). The Subcommittee noted there were clear metabolic advantages demonstrated with aripiprazole compared with other antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine and clozapine.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that aripiprazole provides strong additional benefits above currently funded antipsychotic agents. The Subcommittee noted that aripiprazole has a relatively benign metabolic profile compared to currently available depot antipsychotics, possibly better efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (eg. as reported in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601722/pdf/sbv125.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Robinson et al. Schizophrenia Bulletin. 2015;41:1227-36 </a>compared with risperidone), is useful as an adjuvant treatment in patients receiving clozapine, and may also have useful coantidepressant activity.</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted that hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of antipsychotic treatment and often manifests as sexual dysfunction. Members considered that this can often negatively impact adherence to treatment, particularly for paliperidone. The Subcommittee were made aware of an article that reported that risperidone, paliperidone, amisulpride and haloperidol were associated with the worst outcomes related to hyperprolactinemia while aripiprazole was associated with more preferable outcomes (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30192094/"" target=""_blank"">Stroup and Gray. World Pysch 2018;17:341-56</a>).\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of an unblinded randomised clinical trial which investigated the use of aripiprazole once monthly injections compared with clinician’s choice (which included other depot treatment options) (<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2768027"" target=""_blank"">Kane et al. JAMA Psychiatry. 2020;77:1217-24</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the time to first hospitalisation favoured aripiprazole depot, hazard ratio: 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34- 0.92; P=0.02).\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that of the six currently funded antipsychotic depot agents, only haloperidol and paliperidone are administered monthly, while other agents are administered more regularly. The Subcommittee considered that the addition of aripiprazole depot, as a monthly injection would be a significant advantage to a number of patients.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional risks related to aripiprazole depot include akathisia and that compared with risperidone and olanzapine, presentations of psychosis may be more common. Members noted that akathisia is a serious side effect and would need to be adequately monitored, managed and supported in practice, noting that the depot formulation creates more difficulties compared with oral in relation to reactive dosing changes.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Members also noted that aripiprazole may have lower efficacy compared with some other agents (as described in the direct and indirect comparison metaanalysis <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23810019/"" target=""_blank"">Leucht et al. Lancet. 2013;382:951-62</a>), and as such if patients were 6 transitioned from these agents to aripiprazole depot, they may experience reduced efficacy, particularly in acute schizophrenia compared with olanzapine and risperidone.</p><p><br></p><p>On balance of the available evidence, Members considered that despite its at times lower efficacy, the more favourable side effect profile of aripiprazole depot and the likely positive impact on adherence, compared with currently funded agents, was likely to result in better health outcomes for a number of people with schizophrenia.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that those who would benefit most from aripiprazole depot include: (1) people responding well to oral aripiprazole but for whom adherence is a challenge; and (2) people requiring depot antipsychotics but whom have, or are at risk of severe metabolic side effects. The Subcommittee noted that Māori have higher rates of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and as such are particularly likely to benefit from aripiprazole depot.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if aripiprazole depot were funded for schizophrenia, uptake would be moderate. Members estimated that at least 10% of patients on oral aripiprazole (however likely higher), 5-10% on first generation depot agents and 15-20% of patients on second generation depot agents would transition to aripiprazole depot. Members considered that very few patients would likely shift from other oral antipsychotic agents. The Subcommittee considered that the use of oral aripiprazole would likely increase if the depot formulation were funded.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that aripiprazole depot would likely be a preferable treatment option in early settings, with higher uptake in younger individuals (eg. teens to twenties).\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Members noted there may be benefit of aripiprazole depot in other indications such as bipolar affective disorder or treatment-resistant major depression, but that these were off-label indications and that a funding application had not been received for either of these indications.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for aripiprazole depot if it were to be funded in New Zealand for schizophrenia. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
