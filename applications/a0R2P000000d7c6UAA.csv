Ann Pharmacother. 2021;55:303-10). This retrospective analysis was conducted of IV pamidronate disodium and zoledronic acid in 113 adult patients with hypercalcaemia and creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;60 mL/min. The primary endpoint of all-grade serum creatinine elevations occurred in 28 (24.8%) patients, with grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine elevations in 10.9% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium and 1.7% of patients receiving zoledronic acid. There were no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw and incidence of grade 1 or 2 hypocalcaemia was similar between treatment groups. Overall, 64.6% of patients achieved normalisation of corrected serum calcium by day 10, and there were no statistical differences between bisphosphonate type and renal function.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Glucocorticoid sparing effect of zoledronic acid in sarcoid hypercalcemia (Kuchay et al. Arch Osteoporos. 2017;12:68). The authors report three cases of sarcoid hypercalcemia who were successfully managed with oral glucocorticoids for many months before developing adverse effects of glucocorticoids. When tapering of glucocorticoids was attempted, hypercalcemia recurred, so zoledronic acid was administered in order to control hypercalcemia and to allow tapering of glucocorticoids. Following zoledronic acid administration, serum calcium level normalised and glucocorticoids could be discontinued in all the three patients. Normocalcemia was maintained for an average of 18 months after a single infusion and sarcoidosis remained in remission in all the three patients.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Short-Term Safety of Zoledronic Acid in Young Patients With Bone Disorders: An Extensive Institutional Experience (George et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015;100:4163-71). This was a retrospective chart review of 81 inpatients and outpatients less than 21 years old who received at least one zoledronic acid infusion between 2010 and 2014 at a single hospital site. A total of 204 infusions were received. The most common indications were osteoporosis (33% of cohort), osteogenesis imperfecta (27.2%), chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (14.8%) and avascular necrosis (7.4%). Less than 5% of participants were diagnosed with each of the following: low bone mineral density, bone metastases, osteolytic lesions, fibrous dysplasia, vitamin D toxicity, cutis laxa, and fragility fracture not otherwise specified. Adverse events were mild and more common after the first infusion in patients with no previous bisphosphonate exposure. Adverse events included hypophosphatemia (25.2% of infusions), acute phase reactions (19.1%), and hypocalcaemia (16.4%). Symptomatic hypocalcaemia requiring intravenous calcium occurred after two infusions.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Zoledronic acid in paediatric metabolic bone disorders (Bowden et al. Transl Pediatr. 2017;6:256-68). This review discusses the safety and use of zoledronic acid in childhood osteoporosis, chemotherapy-related osteonecrosis, hypercalcaemic disorders and malignant bone tumours.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Acute unilateral anterior uveitis following zoledronic acid infusion: A case report (Anandasayanan et al. SAGE Open Med Case Rep. 2020;8:2050313X20944305). The authors describe the rare case of a 75-year-old female who presented with features of acute unilateral non-granulomatous anterior uveitis, which developed within 24 hours following the first dose of intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid administered to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. She was treated with topical steroids and made an uneventful recovery in 2 weeks.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Löfgren Syndrome with Hypercalcemia and Neuroendocrinological Involvement: A Case Report (Almaguer-Morales et al. Curr Rheumatol Rev. 2020;16:337-42). This case report discusses a 42-year-old woman with an atypical case of Löfgren Syndrome, a subtype of sarcoidosis occurring in 20-30% of cases. The patient was successfully treated in hospital with zoledronic acid and as an outpatient with immunosuppressive therapy.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Intractable hypercalcaemia during pregnancy and the postpartum secondary to pathogenic variants in CYP24A1 (Arnold et al. Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep. 2019:19-0114). The authors report two cases of parathyroid-independent hypercalcaemia of pregnancy, due to biallelic loss of function of the P450 enzyme CYP24A1, the principal inactivator of 1,25(OH)2D results in hypervitaminosis D, hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. The second case was hypercalcaemic post-partum with a suppressed parathyroid hormone, normal 25(OH)D, and elevated 1,25(OH)2D levels. Her symptoms partially responded to intravenous saline and corticosteroids but bisphosphonates such as pamidronate disodium and zoledronic acid did not result in sustained improvement. Denosumab 120 mg subcutaneous injection successfully treated the hypercalcaemia, resolving completely 2 months post-partum.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Use of Zoledronic Acid in a Neonate with Subcutaneous Fat Necrosis Complicated with Severe, Refractory Hypercalcemia (Militello et al. Am J Perinatol. 2019;36(S 02):S134- S138). Subcutaneous fat necrosis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the adipose tissue that may occur in the neonatal period. It is usually a self-limited condition; however, in complicated cases it can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening hypercalcemia. In this case, the serum calcium level reached 16.6 mg/dL. Standard treatment with intravenous fluids, furosemide and then methylprednisolone was not effective. Subsequently a single low dose of zoledronic acid was administered and ultimately managed the hypercalcemia.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Zoledronic acid for neonatal subcutaneous fat necrosis (Di Bari et al. Clin Case Rep. 2017;5:567-9). An infant with subcutaneous fat necrosis and serum calcium of 15 mg/dL was treated with prednisolone and low-dose zoledronic acid. Serum calcium promptly normalised without rebound hypocalcaemia and redosing of zoledronic acid was not necessary.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Life-Threatening Hypercalcemia During Prodrome of Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia in an Immunocompetent Infant (VanSickle et al. Glob Pediatr Health. 2017;4:2333794X17705955). An 8-week-old girl with Pneumocystis jiroveci infection and life-threatening hypercalcemia (23.5 mg/dL) received Treatment with intravenous hydration, loop diuretic, and calcitonin which failed to correct the hypercalcemia. She was subsequently treated with zoledronic acid on 3 successive days (cumulative dose 0.375 mg) and serum calcium normalised on day 15.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Life-Threatening Hypercalcemia due to Graves&#39; Disease and Concomitant Adrenal Failure: A Case Report and Review of the Literature (Ozkaya et al. Case Rep Endocrinol. 2015;2015:684648).</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Systemic lupus erythematosus and hypercalcaemia: case report and brief review of the literature (Karageorgas et al. Scand J Rheumatol. 2011;40:408-9).</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>The effect of intravenous zoledronic acid on glucocorticoid-induced multiple vertebral fractures in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (Souza et al. Rev Hosp Clin Fac Med Sao Paulo. 2004;59:302-5).</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered there to be no high-quality, clinical trial evidence for zoledronic acid in the treatment of non-malignant hypercalcaemia. However, the Committee considered it reasonable to extrapolate the evidence from zoledronic acid in hypercalcaemia of malignancy and its efficacy in reducing serum calcium, to hypercalcaemia of a non-malignant cause. Members noted a meta-analysis (Major et al. J Clin Oncol. 2001;19:558- 67) of two RCTs, that reported zoledronic acid as superior to pamidronate in the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered there is a level of class effect in the likely side effects among bisphosphonates, and noted the bulk of the evidence is for zoledronic acid due to its market share. The Committee noted the potential risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (0.88-3.1% incidence) and anterior uveitis (Hoff et al., J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:18_suppl, 8528-8528) with intravenous pamidronate and/or zoledronic acid, but considered the risks associated with zoledronic acid would likely be the same or similar to the risks associated with pamidronate. The Committee considered the clinical risk of funding zoledronic acid for the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia was not greater than the current risk associated with pamidronate, noting pamidronate is listed with no restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that either the 4 or 5 mg presentation of zoledronic acid would be suitable for use in the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia. The Committee noted that neither presentation of zoledronic acid is Medsafe-approved for the considered indication. The Committee noted pamidronate was also not Medsafe-approved for this indication, and reiterated that clinicians need to exercise their clinical judgement when prescribing within their scope of practice for any medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that approximately 1,000 patients per year would likely access zoledronic acid if it were funded for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia. The Committee considered patients currently receiving pamidronate infusions would all likely switch to zoledronic acid infusions, noting it is a faster infusion (fifteen minutes versus two hours) and is administered less frequently. The Committee considered the reduction in infusion time would provide significant benefit to the healthcare sector.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered zoledronic acid would be used alongside a range of other pharmaceuticals; including glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, and that cinacalcet or denosumab, which are not currently funded for hypercalcaemia, might also be considered, depending on the underlying condition, and considered it would replace pamidronate disodium.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered some patients may remain on treatment for life if no underlying cause of hypercalcaemia is found. However, the Committee also considered some patients may use zoledronic acid as a short-term treatment, as a ‘bridge’ to more definitive treatment parathyroid surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it likely zoledronic acid infusions would be repeated approximately every 4-6 weeks, based on the data on the use of zoledronic acid in the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy. However, the Committee noted this would vary considerably, depending on the underlying disease and patient response. The Committee considered the broader population using zoledronic acid as a ‘bridge’ would likely receive 1 or 2 doses, while the lifelong patients would likely receive infusions every 4-6 weeks. The Committee considered that pamidronate can be dose titrated as it is available in three strengths, however the Committee considered it unlikely zoledronic acid would be dose titrated.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the data for pamidronate indicates the large majority of doses are administered in a hospital setting, and considered the initial dose of zoledronic acid may be administered in hospital. However, the Committee considered zoledronic acid would be more likely to be administered longer-term in the community when compared with pamidronate, given the shortened infusion time. The Committee considered this may be beneficial in improving access to those in rural areas who would currently be required to access a hospital infusion service.</p><p><br></p><p>On balance, the Committee considered that the faster infusion time of zoledronic acid compared to pamidronate offered significant benefit to the healthcare sector and that there were no significant clinical risks in funding zoledronic acid for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, given pamidronate was already being used for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for zoledronic acid if it were to be funded in New Zealand for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0P2P000006zo48&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001V1bO"" alt=""image.png""></img></p><p>\xa0\xa0\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee considered that the application for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia sought funding for zoledronic acid for a very broad population that was challenging to define.

Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep. 2019:19-0114). The authors report two cases of parathyroid-independent hypercalcaemia of pregnancy, due to biallelic loss of function of the P450 enzyme CYP24A1, the principal inactivator of 1,25(OH)2D results in hypervitaminosis D, hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. The second case was hypercalcaemic post-partum with a suppressed parathyroid hormone, normal 25(OH)D, and elevated 1,25(OH)2D levels. Her symptoms partially responded to intravenous saline and corticosteroids but bisphosphonates such as pamidronate disodium and zoledronic acid did not result in sustained improvement.

It is usually a self-limited condition; however, in complicated cases it can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening hypercalcemia. In this case, the serum calcium level reached 16.6 mg/dL.

However, the Committee considered it reasonable to extrapolate the evidence from zoledronic acid in hypercalcaemia of malignancy and its efficacy in reducing serum calcium, to hypercalcaemia of a non-malignant cause. Members noted a meta-analysis (Major et al.

The Committee considered the clinical risk of funding zoledronic acid for the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia was not greater than the current risk associated with pamidronate, noting pamidronate is listed with no restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that either the 4 or 5 mg presentation of zoledronic acid would be suitable for use in the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia. The Committee noted that neither presentation of zoledronic acid is Medsafe-approved for the considered indication. The Committee noted pamidronate was also not Medsafe-approved for this indication, and reiterated that clinicians need to exercise their clinical judgement when prescribing within their scope of practice for any medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that approximately 1,000 patients per year would likely access zoledronic acid if it were funded for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia. The Committee considered patients currently receiving pamidronate infusions would all likely switch to zoledronic acid infusions, noting it is a faster infusion (fifteen minutes versus two hours) and is administered less frequently. The Committee considered the reduction in infusion time would provide significant benefit to the healthcare sector.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered zoledronic acid would be used alongside a range of other pharmaceuticals; including glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, and that cinacalcet or denosumab, which are not currently funded for hypercalcaemia, might also be considered, depending on the underlying condition, and considered it would replace pamidronate disodium.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered some patients may remain on treatment for life if no underlying cause of hypercalcaemia is found. However, the Committee also considered some patients may use zoledronic acid as a short-term treatment, as a ‘bridge’ to more definitive treatment parathyroid surgery.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it likely zoledronic acid infusions would be repeated approximately every 4-6 weeks, based on the data on the use of zoledronic acid in the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy. However, the Committee noted this would vary considerably, depending on the underlying disease and patient response. The Committee considered the broader population using zoledronic acid as a ‘bridge’ would likely receive 1 or 2 doses, while the lifelong patients would likely receive infusions every 4-6 weeks. The Committee considered that pamidronate can be dose titrated as it is available in three strengths, however the Committee considered it unlikely zoledronic acid would be dose titrated.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the data for pamidronate indicates the large majority of doses are administered in a hospital setting, and considered the initial dose of zoledronic acid may be administered in hospital. However, the Committee considered zoledronic acid would be more likely to be administered longer-term in the community when compared with pamidronate, given the shortened infusion time. The Committee considered this may be beneficial in improving access to those in rural areas who would currently be required to access a hospital infusion service.</p><p><br></p><p>On balance, the Committee considered that the faster infusion time of zoledronic acid compared to pamidronate offered significant benefit to the healthcare sector and that there were no significant clinical risks in funding zoledronic acid for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, given pamidronate was already being used for this indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the below table summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for zoledronic acid if it were to be funded in New Zealand for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia.

The Committee also considered the inconsistent access to infusion services for patients in New Zealand requiring treatment infusions, the adverse renal events associated with zoledronic acid, and that zoledronic acid is not Medsafe-approved for this indication.</p>', 'Published_Application__c': '<p>The Committee reviewed the clinician application for zoledronic acid in the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia.</p>', 'Published_Discussion__c': '<p>The Committee considered that the application for moderate to severe hypercalcaemia sought funding for zoledronic acid for a very broad population that was challenging to define. The Committee noted that the application requested the funded access to zoledronic acid be widened to include patients with moderate to severe hypercalcaemia where no reversible cause is found.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered severe hypercalcaemia is generally defined as a serum calcium concentration of &gt; 3 mmol/L (Minisola et al., BMJ 2015;350:h2723).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered the overall prevalence of hypercalcaemia is unclear. The Committee considered prevalence is best described for sub-populations prevalence of hypercalcaemia in people with primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. The Committee noted the estimated prevalence in the general population is 1:1,000 and that hypercalcaemia accounts for approximately 0.6% of all acute medical admissions (Turner. Clin Med (Lond). 2017;17:270-3).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted approximately 90% of hypercalcaemia is due to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy (Minisola et al. BMJ 2015;350:h2723).

The Committee considered the overall health need of patients with moderate to severe hypercalcaemia would depend more on the underlying condition rather than the hypercalcaemia itself. The Committee noted that hypercalcaemia caused by some conditions would resolve on treatment of the underlying disease but considered that treatment for hypercalcaemia may be needed in the interim (which can be lengthy depending on variable access and wait times for surgery).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that people with a range of underlying causes would benefit from zoledronic acid to treat symptomatic hypercalcaemia.

The primary endpoint of all-grade serum creatinine elevations occurred in 28 (24.8%) patients, with grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine elevations in 10.9% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium and 1.7% of patients receiving zoledronic acid. There were no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw and incidence of grade 1 or 2 hypocalcaemia was similar between treatment groups.

Arch Osteoporos. 2017;12:68). The authors report three cases of sarcoid hypercalcemia who were successfully managed with oral glucocorticoids for many months before developing adverse effects of glucocorticoids. When tapering of glucocorticoids was attempted, hypercalcemia recurred, so zoledronic acid was administered in order to control hypercalcemia and to allow tapering of glucocorticoids. Following zoledronic acid administration, serum calcium level normalised and glucocorticoids could be discontinued in all the three patients. Normocalcemia was maintained for an average of 18 months after a single infusion and sarcoidosis remained in remission in all the three patients.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Short-Term Safety of Zoledronic Acid in Young Patients With Bone Disorders: An Extensive Institutional Experience (George et al.
