The Committee noted that in February 2019 PTAC had concerns about what PTAC considered were the proposalâ€™s modest reworking of the formulation, poor quality evidence, lack of clarity around an appropriate comparator for New Zealand, main benefit (likely to be avoidance of steroid side-effects) and likely high cost.</p><p><i style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Discussion</i></p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the health need of patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) has been described in the previous Gastrointestinal Subcommittee and PTAC records. The Committee considered that UC is a long-term disease with a variable prognosis including relapses and remissions, and noted that UC reduces the quality of life of New Zealand patients with major impact in many areas (<a href=""https://issuu.com/crohnsandcolitisnz/docs/271017_master_formatted_bod_report_"" target=""_blank"">Crohn&#39;s Colitis New Zealand [CCNZ], 2017).</a></p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that New Zealand patients with UC initially receive funded treatment with systemic or local 5-ASAs e.g. mesalazine, olsalazine or sulphasalazine; if these agents are insufficient, then oral steroids e.g. prednisone or hydrocortisone; are used, followed by immunosuppressants e.g. azathioprine or methotrexate, and then biologics for severe UC e.g. infliximab or adalimumab. The Committee noted that treatment with prednisone, even in other indications, is known to be associated with a predictable corticosteroid-related side effects in a proportion of patients (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600032"" target=""_blank"">Manns et al.

Members considered that while treatment of relapse is beneficial, most patients would require other treatments in time. The Committee considered that up to 25% of patients whose disease progresses require a colectomy within 10 years and 12-14% patients develop extra-intestinal disease. </p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide colonic release (CR) 9 mg is a specific formulation of budesonide, a second-generation glucocorticoid that is significantly more potent than prednisone, with a different mechanism of absorption as described in the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee record. The Committee considered that while budesonide CR 9 mg largely acts locally, it still has systemic effects.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide CR 9 mg is approved by Medsafe and internationally (and is funded in about half of countries where it is approved) for the induction of remission in adult patients with mild to moderate active UC where 5-ASA therapy has been not sufficient or not tolerated. </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the current funding application specifically seeks funding of the CR formulation of budesonide and considered that the CR delivery was different but results in the same plasma concentration of budesonide and has a systemic effect. The Committee considered that the appropriate New Zealand comparator treatment for budesonide CR 9 mg would be prednisone, which is used as the standard of care treatment of mild to moderate UC that is not controlled by 5-ASA drugs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that budesonide controlled ileal release (CIR) 3 mg (Entocort CIR) is currently funded, with use restricted to Crohnâ€™s disease, microscopic colitis or gut Graft vs Host disease, and considered that budesonide CIR is used as a 9 mg dose with a similar treatment effect to prednisone 40 mg. Members noted that the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee had concerns about the side effect profile of prednisone, and considered that budesonide CIR is used for patients with Crohnâ€™s disease especially in those unable to take or tolerate prednisone (~25% of patients with Crohnâ€™s disease).

The Committee considered that UC is a long-term disease with a variable prognosis including relapses and remissions, and noted that UC reduces the quality of life of New Zealand patients with major impact in many areas (<a href=""https://issuu.com/crohnsandcolitisnz/docs/271017_master_formatted_bod_report_"" target=""_blank"">Crohn&#39;s Colitis New Zealand [CCNZ], 2017).</a></p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that New Zealand patients with UC initially receive funded treatment with systemic or local 5-ASAs e.g. mesalazine, olsalazine or sulphasalazine; if these agents are insufficient, then oral steroids e.g. prednisone or hydrocortisone; are used, followed by immunosuppressants e.g. azathioprine or methotrexate, and then biologics for severe UC e.g. infliximab or adalimumab. The Committee noted that treatment with prednisone, even in other indications, is known to be associated with a predictable corticosteroid-related side effects in a proportion of patients (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600032"" target=""_blank"">Manns et al.
