The Subcommittee noted that CF is characterised by multisystem organ impairment, substantial morbidity, and premature death.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that functioning CFTR pumps chloride ions into the extracellular space, which hydrates exocrine secretions. The Subcommittee noted that a defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis, which leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems. The Subcommittee noted that the build-up of these secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the most common mutations of CFTR can be classed as deletions in the F508 gene (F), and can be classified as minimal function (MF), gating (G), residual function (RF) or other; F/F patients are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (have two copies of F508del); F/RF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a residual function (RF) mutation in the other allele; F/G patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a gating (G) mutation in the other allele; F/MF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation in the other allele; F/R117H patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a R117H mutation in the other allele; F/other patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a second allele that is unknown and/or has not yet been characterised as gating, RF or MF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pulmonary exacerbations, malnutrition, infections, and other complications further reduce the quality of life and life expectancy of CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that CF leads to frequent hospitalisations and is a common cause for lung transplant, and that a substantial proportion of hospital respiratory inpatient admissions are for complications of CF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters (from former CF Panel) considered that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Subcommittee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that patients with CF have significant emotional, symptom, and treatment-related burden in day-to-day life and that the reduction in life expectancy has a significant negative impact for these patients. The Subcommittee noted that the median age of CF patients in New Zealand is 18 years while the median age of the New Zealand population is 37, and over 40% of CF patients are aged less than 16 years compared with 19% in the general population. The Subcommittee considered that this reflected the significant morbidity and mortality experienced by this patient group. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 540 patients with CF in New Zealand (all ages and genotypes) and noted that CF registry data available is from 2017 and does not include patients who have undergone lung transplants.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently the majority of CF patients receive \u201cbest supportive care\u201d (BSC), which includes mucolytics, osmotic agents, antibiotics, bronchodilators, enzyme and vitamin replacements and supplements, and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that the aim of best supportive care is to slow disease progression, maintain respiratory function, improve nutritional status, improve symptoms, and enhance quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that in addition to controlling symptoms, other treatment goals include preserving lung function and improving nutritional status, reducing the rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotics, and managing CF-related co-morbidities (eg. diabetes).\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently ivacaftor (IVA) is funded in New Zealand for CF-patients with specific gating (Class III) mutations but that this represents less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population. The Subcommittee noted that some of these patients will also have an F mutation and would thus be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were funded in New Zealand under the proposed access criteria.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10% of the New Zealand CF population is made up of M\u0101ori and Pacific people, and that there is insufficient information to characterise these CF patients in terms of their CF mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that due to such small patient numbers, it is difficult to ascertain if M\u0101ori and Pacific patients have worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients, but considered this likely, noting that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that it was highly likely that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients would have worse outcomes, given that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific people are underrepresented in the group who may be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that respiratory health and diabetes are described as Pharmac priority health areas of focus for M\u0101ori, however considered that CF-related bronchiectasis should not be conflated with non-CF bronchiectasis, this being a setting where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are over-represented, and that similarly CF-related diabetes should not be conflated with type 2 diabetes, where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are also overrepresented.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are a number of funded treatments for CF symptoms that are not funded for non-CF counterparts, such as insulin pumps, special foods, replacement glucose meters, sterile water (for hypertonic saline nebs), azithromycin (funded for children but not adults with non-CF bronchiectasis), colistin injection, gentamicin injection, tobramycin injection, tobramycin solution for inhalation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of CF patient hospital admissions are for the treatment of respiratory infections and cited a study that reported that 75% of hospitalisations were coded as respiratory-related (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20967840/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephenson et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011;46:376-84</a>), and considered that many factors may predispose some CF patients to require more frequent hospitalisations, such as: poor lung function, CF-related diabetes, poor nutritional status, poor exercise performance, <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> infection, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> colonisation, poor medicine adherence, lower socioeconomic status, or having a high risk genotype such as F/F. The Subcommittee however considered that these factors in turn may be markers for more severe disease rather than an individual patient\u2019s predisposition to hospitalisation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is likely a high variability in patients and their health care that influences the rate of lung function decline in CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that F/RF mutations are associated with slower rates of decline over time, as is adherence and access to best supportive care. The Subcommittee also noted that pulmonary exacerbations are generally thought to contribute to faster lung function decline. The Subcommittee noted that Cogen et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26061914/\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015;50:763-70</a>) reported that female gender, frequent or productive cough, low BMI, pulmonary exacerbations, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </i>infections caused greater lung function decline over time, while Harun et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259460/\" target=\"_blank\">Paediatr Pespir Rev. 2016;20:55-66</a>) reported that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection and pancreatic insufficiency contributed to an increased rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee considered that there is significant uncertainty in published data regarding the above factors and that the evidence overall is inconclusive.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that adverse health events out of the patients control such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection or influenza can cause a more rapid decline, from which patients do not usually recover. The CF treaters considered that in general lung function decline is usually linear, but that there are clear instances where there is a stepwise drop in lung function related primarily to exacerbations, and that there is a correlation between frequency of exacerbations and the rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee also noted that the CF treaters considered that the correlation between genotype and phenotype in CF patients is imperfect, and that two patients with the same mutations may not have the same rate of disease progression, but that in general mutational status indicative of more severe disease would almost certainly have an accelerated decline in lung function. In addition, the CF treaters considered that the rate of lung function decline was also driven by environmental factors, which would likely also be influenced by socioeconomic factors. The Subcommittee also noted that there are various other disease modifying genes known to affect CF severity and the rate of lung function decline, but that the effects of these have not been well characterised, and that testing for modifying genes is not widely available.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the New Zealand CF patient population would have comparable baseline characteristics to CF patients in the United Kingdom, due to the two populations being primarily Caucasian, but noted that the New Zealand patient population is relatively uninfluenced by CFTR modulator therapies and likely have less access to CF specialist clinics than their UK counterparts, which may contribute to the reduced average age of the CF population in New Zealand compared with the United Kingdom.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that overall, the strength and quality of evidence relating to the high health need of CF patient is excellent, both globally and in the New Zealand context, and noted the substantial evidence supporting the health need of this patient population provided by the supplier and CFNZ.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator with multiple modes of action; ELX and TEZ bind to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, and IVA potentiates functioning of this CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple definitions of pulmonary exacerbations throughout the literature and that in some instances severe pulmonary exacerbation is sometimes defined as a pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalisation. The Subcommittee considered that rates of exacerbations vary by definition and that no one definition is ideal or superior. The Subcommittee considered that a decrease in exacerbations by any definition in a clinical trial likely translates to a similar decrease in exacerbations defined by a different severity or defined by different criteria (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32682670/\" target=\"_blank\">Van Devanter et al. J Cyst Fibrosis. 2021;20:39-45</a>).

The Subcommittee considered that it was an appropriately designed network meta-analysis that included consistent trial designs and study populations (limited to those aged 12 and over) for comparison, large effect sizes, consistent results across outcome measures, and evidence of a dose response that indicated that triple therapy (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was more effective than double or single therapies, which were in turn more effective than best supportive care.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that improvements in nutritional status and BMI were observed in all studies.

The Subcommittee noted that the build-up of these secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the most common mutations of CFTR can be classed as deletions in the F508 gene (F), and can be classified as minimal function (MF), gating (G), residual function (RF) or other; F/F patients are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (have two copies of F508del); F/RF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a residual function (RF) mutation in the other allele; F/G patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a gating (G) mutation in the other allele; F/MF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation in the other allele; F/R117H patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a R117H mutation in the other allele; F/other patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a second allele that is unknown and/or has not yet been characterised as gating, RF or MF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pulmonary exacerbations, malnutrition, infections, and other complications further reduce the quality of life and life expectancy of CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that CF leads to frequent hospitalisations and is a common cause for lung transplant, and that a substantial proportion of hospital respiratory inpatient admissions are for complications of CF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters (from former CF Panel) considered that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Subcommittee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that patients with CF have significant emotional, symptom, and treatment-related burden in day-to-day life and that the reduction in life expectancy has a significant negative impact for these patients. The Subcommittee noted that the median age of CF patients in New Zealand is 18 years while the median age of the New Zealand population is 37, and over 40% of CF patients are aged less than 16 years compared with 19% in the general population. The Subcommittee considered that this reflected the significant morbidity and mortality experienced by this patient group. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 540 patients with CF in New Zealand (all ages and genotypes) and noted that CF registry data available is from 2017 and does not include patients who have undergone lung transplants.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently the majority of CF patients receive \u201cbest supportive care\u201d (BSC), which includes mucolytics, osmotic agents, antibiotics, bronchodilators, enzyme and vitamin replacements and supplements, and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that the aim of best supportive care is to slow disease progression, maintain respiratory function, improve nutritional status, improve symptoms, and enhance quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that in addition to controlling symptoms, other treatment goals include preserving lung function and improving nutritional status, reducing the rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotics, and managing CF-related co-morbidities (eg. diabetes).\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently ivacaftor (IVA) is funded in New Zealand for CF-patients with specific gating (Class III) mutations but that this represents less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population. The Subcommittee noted that some of these patients will also have an F mutation and would thus be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were funded in New Zealand under the proposed access criteria.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10% of the New Zealand CF population is made up of M\u0101ori and Pacific people, and that there is insufficient information to characterise these CF patients in terms of their CF mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that due to such small patient numbers, it is difficult to ascertain if M\u0101ori and Pacific patients have worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients, but considered this likely, noting that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that it was highly likely that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients would have worse outcomes, given that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific people are underrepresented in the group who may be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that respiratory health and diabetes are described as Pharmac priority health areas of focus for M\u0101ori, however considered that CF-related bronchiectasis should not be conflated with non-CF bronchiectasis, this being a setting where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are over-represented, and that similarly CF-related diabetes should not be conflated with type 2 diabetes, where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are also overrepresented.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are a number of funded treatments for CF symptoms that are not funded for non-CF counterparts, such as insulin pumps, special foods, replacement glucose meters, sterile water (for hypertonic saline nebs), azithromycin (funded for children but not adults with non-CF bronchiectasis), colistin injection, gentamicin injection, tobramycin injection, tobramycin solution for inhalation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of CF patient hospital admissions are for the treatment of respiratory infections and cited a study that reported that 75% of hospitalisations were coded as respiratory-related (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20967840/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephenson et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011;46:376-84</a>), and considered that many factors may predispose some CF patients to require more frequent hospitalisations, such as: poor lung function, CF-related diabetes, poor nutritional status, poor exercise performance, <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> infection, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> colonisation, poor medicine adherence, lower socioeconomic status, or having a high risk genotype such as F/F. The Subcommittee however considered that these factors in turn may be markers for more severe disease rather than an individual patient\u2019s predisposition to hospitalisation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is likely a high variability in patients and their health care that influences the rate of lung function decline in CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that F/RF mutations are associated with slower rates of decline over time, as is adherence and access to best supportive care. The Subcommittee also noted that pulmonary exacerbations are generally thought to contribute to faster lung function decline. The Subcommittee noted that Cogen et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26061914/\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015;50:763-70</a>) reported that female gender, frequent or productive cough, low BMI, pulmonary exacerbations, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </i>infections caused greater lung function decline over time, while Harun et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259460/\" target=\"_blank\">Paediatr Pespir Rev. 2016;20:55-66</a>) reported that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection and pancreatic insufficiency contributed to an increased rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee considered that there is significant uncertainty in published data regarding the above factors and that the evidence overall is inconclusive.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that adverse health events out of the patients control such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection or influenza can cause a more rapid decline, from which patients do not usually recover. The CF treaters considered that in general lung function decline is usually linear, but that there are clear instances where there is a stepwise drop in lung function related primarily to exacerbations, and that there is a correlation between frequency of exacerbations and the rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee also noted that the CF treaters considered that the correlation between genotype and phenotype in CF patients is imperfect, and that two patients with the same mutations may not have the same rate of disease progression, but that in general mutational status indicative of more severe disease would almost certainly have an accelerated decline in lung function. In addition, the CF treaters considered that the rate of lung function decline was also driven by environmental factors, which would likely also be influenced by socioeconomic factors. The Subcommittee also noted that there are various other disease modifying genes known to affect CF severity and the rate of lung function decline, but that the effects of these have not been well characterised, and that testing for modifying genes is not widely available.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the New Zealand CF patient population would have comparable baseline characteristics to CF patients in the United Kingdom, due to the two populations being primarily Caucasian, but noted that the New Zealand patient population is relatively uninfluenced by CFTR modulator therapies and likely have less access to CF specialist clinics than their UK counterparts, which may contribute to the reduced average age of the CF population in New Zealand compared with the United Kingdom.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that overall, the strength and quality of evidence relating to the high health need of CF patient is excellent, both globally and in the New Zealand context, and noted the substantial evidence supporting the health need of this patient population provided by the supplier and CFNZ.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator with multiple modes of action; ELX and TEZ bind to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, and IVA potentiates functioning of this CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple definitions of pulmonary exacerbations throughout the literature and that in some instances severe pulmonary exacerbation is sometimes defined as a pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalisation. The Subcommittee considered that rates of exacerbations vary by definition and that no one definition is ideal or superior. The Subcommittee considered that a decrease in exacerbations by any definition in a clinical trial likely translates to a similar decrease in exacerbations defined by a different severity or defined by different criteria (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32682670/\" target=\"_blank\">Van Devanter et al. J Cyst Fibrosis. 2021;20:39-45</a>).

The Subcommittee noted that despite having less lung damage the 6\u201311-year age group experienced significant improvements in ppFEV1, but that their CFQ-R scores did not improve as substantially. The Subcommittee considered that this was likely due to the younger age group having less severe disease, and thus better respiratory-related quality of life at baseline. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(62, 62, 60);\">The Subcommittee noted that many patients in the studies experienced a week or two long \u2018purge\u2019 upon initiation of treatment due to the clearing of mucus from the lungs resulting from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that 1-2% of patients in the trials discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to intolerance. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that treatment related adverse events were consistent throughout studies and across subgroups. The Subcommittee considered that methods for recording adverse events may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect rare or slow-to-develop adverse events, and thus there remains significant uncertainty about the nature, severity, frequency or extent of the risks associated with this ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that common drug-related adverse included cough, elevated liver enzymes, rash, and mild rises in creatine kinase. The Subcommittee noted that, usually, cough, skin rash and elevations of liver enzymes were of short duration and could be managed by drug dose changes or interruptions, and that female patients, particularly those on combined oral contraceptives, may be more likely to develop a rash.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that mild increases in blood-pressure were also reported, but considered that this is of unknown clinical significance. The Subcommittee however considered that if this medication allows CF patients to live longer, then prevention of age-related conditions such as coronary artery disease or stroke may become more important. The Subcommittee noted that eye-problems have been reported in other studies involving IVA, but that the ELX/TEZ/IVA studies were not well set up to detect these. The Subcommittee also noted that there are post marketing reports of 7 patients who had testicular pain in the first week of drug initiation, but that this could reasonably be expected with hydration of the lumen of an obstructed vas deferens (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32471772/\" target=\"_blank\">Rotolo et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2020;19:e39-41</a>). Overall, the Subcommittee considered that there is significant uncertainty in evaluating the risks, particularly long-term risks, until long term safety studies and real-world clinical cohort follow up studies have been completed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence indicates that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides patients with substantial improvements in quality life and an expectation of substantial prolongation of life; and that the medication can significantly improve sweat chloride measurements, often to the normal range, which is <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">the best available surrogate marker for CFTR function in the internal organs</span>. The Subcommittee considered that good efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been observed across subgroups including with different genotypes, and that results supporting a clinical benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA have been consistent between randomised controlled trials, in before-and after analyses in open label efficacy studies and in real world cohorts. The Subcommittee considered that results were durable between timepoints within randomised controlled trials or open label extension studies.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the randomised controlled trials employed appropriate methods for statistical analysis, choice of control intervention, randomisation, allocation, blinding and were well matched at baseline, and that although study participant numbers were relatively small that these were appropriate and sufficiently powered given the large effect size of the ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee also considered that the outcome variables measured were generally appropriate and that future trials could attempt to measure patient-centred outcome variables and quality of life more directly. The Subcommittee considered that given the biological plausibility, improvement in sweat chloride and ppFEV1, that it is likely that any study reporting patient-centred outcome measures will also show positive results.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there were many demographics not included in the clinical trials; those taking prohibited concomitant medications, pregnant individuals, people with organ transplants, patients with cancer, patients with alcohol or drug use, those with comorbidities, and those with certain infections. The Subcommittee considered that exclusion of these patients may limit the generalisability of the results to the real-world context, as many CF patients will experience one or more of the factors listed.</p><p><br></p><p><i>General comments</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA could allow patients with CF to live a nearly normal life, but also considered that a number of patients living in New Zealand already have structural lung, pancreatic and other organ damage that would not be undone by correcting CFTR activity with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and these patients would have to remain on a variety of other medications. The Subcommittee considered that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a paradigm-shifting treatment for patients with CF, in that it treats the cause of CF rather than its symptoms.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CFQ-R respiratory domain measure is a well validated tool and the most commonly used measure of respiratory-related quality of life in cystic fibrosis trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that it may not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it is difficult to translate changes in CFQ-R to quality adjusted life years, but that it could reasonably serve as a surrogate measure. The Subcommittee considered that there is some uncertainty surrounding a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R but noted that the reported change in CFQ-R for patients receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA was clinically meaningful well beyond the MCID. The Subcommittee noted that other CFQ dimensions reported in ELX/TEZ/IVA studies have also signalled benefits, with the exception of digestive health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that LCI was used as an endpoint in the trials for patients aged 6-11 years. The Subcommittee noted that LCI measures heterogeneity of ventilation, whereas ppFEV1 measures large airway calibre, and that the two measures provide different and independent ways to measure lung function. However, the Subcommittee considered that they will correlate somewhat with each other to some degree, as they both evaluate lung function. The Subcommittee noted that in younger patients with early disease, ppFEV1 may be nearly normal, and that LCI is a sensitive marker of lung disease and is more likely to be abnormal for patients with CF in this age group. The Subcommittee considered that LCI may be a more responsive measure of treatment effect in this age group, as it can be difficult for younger patients to perform spirometry reliably for ppFEV1. The Subcommittee noted that there is no readily agreed upon MCID for LCI, but considered that the reported improvements in LCI with ELX/TEZ/IVA (eg. 1.7 units in study 106 and 2.2 units in study 116) indicate a significant effect size. The Subcommittee noted that LCI is not readily available as a clinical measurement in New Zealand, and therefore it would not be appropriate to include in any eligibility criteria for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.38.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, like ppFEV1, worsening LCI correlates with exacerbations, worse quality of life and prognosis, and considered that it is an appropriate measure of lung function for use in clinical trials, particularly in the paediatric age group. The Subcommittee considered that both LCI and ppFEV1 are measures of lung function and probably reflect a combination of thick secretions in the airway and airway wall inflammation, but that neither correlates perfectly with quality of life or patient-centred outcomes such as being able to live independently, work, form adult relationships, or having the ability to carry out everyday tasks. The Subcommittee considered that no readily measurable outcome variable can encompass the multiple dimensions that contribute to CF morbidity, disease progression and risk.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.39.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is a small proportion of CF patients for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA would be less effective, namely: those patients with genetic mutations unresponsive in vitro (these patients are not included in considerations for this application), those intolerant to ELX/TEZ/IVA, those with gating mutations who are well treated with IVA alone, those for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA may be contraindicated due to morbidity (such as severe baseline liver disease, or concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers), and those with qualifying genetic mutations who may have less severe disease. The Subcommittee noted that the latter are sometimes referred to as patients with CFTR-related disorder or CFTR-related metabolic syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that patients with these conditions may have one F mutation and another that is unknown but that they should not have received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The Subcommittee considered that as a result, approximately 10% of CF patients in New Zealand would not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.40.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 60 patients in New Zealand with CF and no F mutation (who are not included in the patient population considered for this application), and that approximately 10 of those have a gating mutation that may be eligible for treatment with IVA. The Committee noted that, of the remainder, approximately 10 CF patients have mutations where in-vitro testing suggests that ELX/TEZ/IVA will be effective; and considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded that Pharmac may consider extending access to these patients and that it would be important for these patients to have confirmed sweat chloride levels of at least 60 mmol/L. The Subcommittee noted that this would represent a small number of CF patients in New Zealand eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if funded. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to infer a similar benefit from ELX/TEZ/IVA for this patient group, noting the way drug development had occurred for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.41.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to define a patient population with CF at highest risk morbidity and mortality but noted that patients with higher rates of infection and exacerbations, mutations associated with more severe disease, and ppFEV1 &lt;40 are at the highest risk of hospitalisation, mortality, and have the poorest quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it was similarly difficult to define a CF patient population that would benefit most from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA, as treatment has demonstrated substantial and similarly meaningful improvements in quality of life and symptom burden for both those with progressed disease and younger patients who have not yet developed significant organ damage or lung impairment.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.42.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no data regarding the dosage, efficacy and safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA for the patient population under 6 years of age, and that there is currently no evidence to suggest this group would be more or less likely to benefit than those included in current and published clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that due to the robustness of the study results across age groups to date that ELX/TEZ/IVA is likely to be as effective in this age group, causing the relatively preserved lung function of early-stage disease occurring with younger age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.43.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the reduced improvements in clinical trial endpoints seen in patients with F/RF mutations in the clinical trials compared with those with other mutations was likely because F/RF mutations are usually associated with less severe disease, and that the F/RF group was compared with an active comparator in the trial, as opposed to placebo. The Subcommittee considered that, in this context, the results were similarly impressive and suggested that important clinical benefits can come from the addition of ELX to TEZ/IVA even in this less severe patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.44.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume that the 6 to 11-year-old age group would experience a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that this would be to a similar extent to that observed in the 12 years and older age group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.45.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded, it could reasonably increase the prevalence of the disease. The Subcommittee noted that improved survival would likely lead to a higher prevalence of CF (through incident patients surviving longer), and that improved health, vitality and fertility in people with CF may lead to an increase in children born to CF parents and so to an increased incidence and prevalence of CF in the community over time. The Subcommittee considered that at this time, there is no way to quantify to what degree this may affect patient numbers in the future.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.46.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an American study that reported treatment adherence to IVA and LUM/IVA to be 84%, and adherence to TEZ/IVA to be 92% (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33968464/\" target=\"_blank\">Mehta et al. J Drug Assess. 2021;10:62-67</a>). The Subcommittee considered that given the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA, adherence to this treatment is likely to be greater than 92% if it were to be funded in New Zealand. However, the Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that overall adherence rate reduction would be driven by few patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.47.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in the French cohort described above (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33600738/\" target=\"_blank\">Burgel et al. 2021</a>), of 53 CF patients evaluated for transplantation only 7 were transplanted or awaiting transplant, the remainder having the indication for transplant suspended following treatment induction with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that there was a 50% reduction in the rate of lung transplants for CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that these were patients with pre-existing lung damage, and that with time it is likely that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may prevent severe lung disease from developing in the first place, further reducing the need for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that there is not sufficient evidence at this time to ascertain if lung transplants for these patients would be deferred to a later time in life, or if the need would be ultimately reduced. However, the Subcommittee considered the supplier\u2019s estimate of a reduction in lung transplants of approximately 80% to be reasonable, but that this would likely occur over some time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.48.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">The Subcommittee considered that estimates of health utility correlated to clinical ppFEV1 characteristics were reasonable, </span>however, that as this metric is respiratory disease-specific it does not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life<span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">. </span>The Subcommittee noted that lung function represents only one aspect of health and thus correlates only modestly with quality of life, and that other dimensions may be measured with the CFQ-R or exacerbation frequency. The Subcommittee considered that while it is unknown how well improvement in one measure of the CFQ-R correlates with improvement in another and the overall impact on quality of life, <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">all measures have shown substantial mean improvement on treatment and have improved to a similar extent as lung function. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to expect health utility to improve similarly. The Subcommittee also considered that CF patients may experience other significant morbidities while preserving relatively good lung function with BSC, such as pancreatic issues and morbidity associated with treatment burden, and that these are not well captured when using ppFEV1 as a means of grouping patients. The Subcommittee considered that CF patients with mild disease still experience significant CF-related morbidity and treatment burden, and considered that their health utility would be expected to be worse than with full health, even with a ppFEV1 &gt;90%. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable however to relate inpatients healthcare costs to underlying lung function as a surrogate for overall wellbeing, in the absence of more detailed specific information to inform on this. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.49.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that estimates of the health sector cost of a pulmonary exacerbation event vary markedly, and that there is likely to be significant variation in costs between patients and exacerbations at different life stages. The Subcommittee noted that a two-week hospital admission can cost up to $40,000 per patient, but that this may vary widely between health providers.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.50.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that over time there would be an 80% reduction in the use of BSC. The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple clinical trials underway investigating the withdrawal of BSC from the CF treatment regimen in conjunction with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, however that there is limited data at this time to inform this. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to assume that outpatient costs for CF patients would decrease over time with access to ELX/TEZ/IVA, noting though that monitoring, and the associated check-ups would increase with patients living longer.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.51.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients may not require as frequent adjustments to their antibiotic treatment strategy as occurs with best supportive care. The Subcommittee considered that antibiotic use would decrease substantially for patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, particularly intravenous and nebulised antibiotics. The Subcommittee considered that there would be a substantial reduction in the need for nebulised hypertonic saline, dornase alfa and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that hospitalisations would likely decrease, due to decreased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations for this patient group. The Subcommittee however considered it likely that those with CF-related diabetes and/or pancreatic insufficiency will still have these morbidities after starting treatment, but that the younger cohort without CF-related diabetes might avoid this complication by using ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.52.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, given the magnitude of benefit seen so far in clinical trials, it is likely that there will be significant overall survival improvement in the patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted, however, that there is not yet sufficiently long-term evidence to support this, but nonetheless considered it reasonable to infer a long-term survival benefit for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.53.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the patients who are currently taking IVA who are eligible for both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA (ie. those with F/gating mutations), perhaps 80% would switch to ELX/TEZ/IVA, due to the potential greater efficacy as demonstrated in Study 104. The Subcommittee noted that there are 17 patients currently on the New Zealand CF register to whom this would apply, but that some of these patients are under six years of age and would thus not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee considered that the eligible CF population in New Zealand would be 388 patients, increasing to approximately 430 over five years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.54.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high cost of this treatment and eligible patients would expect considerable benefit from treatment if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded. The Subcommittee considered that this would likely affect Pharmac\u2019s ability to fund this treatment for this patient group, given that it would have a very significant impact on the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.55.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CF patients meeting the proposed eligibility criteria. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><table class=\"ql-table-blob\" border=\"0\" style=\"width: 460.45pt;\" width=\"614\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 22.1pt;\"><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 75.3pt;

The Subcommittee noted that despite having less lung damage the 6\u201311-year age group experienced significant improvements in ppFEV1, but that their CFQ-R scores did not improve as substantially. The Subcommittee considered that this was likely due to the younger age group having less severe disease, and thus better respiratory-related quality of life at baseline. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(62, 62, 60);\">The Subcommittee noted that many patients in the studies experienced a week or two long \u2018purge\u2019 upon initiation of treatment due to the clearing of mucus from the lungs resulting from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that 1-2% of patients in the trials discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to intolerance. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that treatment related adverse events were consistent throughout studies and across subgroups. The Subcommittee considered that methods for recording adverse events may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect rare or slow-to-develop adverse events, and thus there remains significant uncertainty about the nature, severity, frequency or extent of the risks associated with this ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that common drug-related adverse included cough, elevated liver enzymes, rash, and mild rises in creatine kinase. The Subcommittee noted that, usually, cough, skin rash and elevations of liver enzymes were of short duration and could be managed by drug dose changes or interruptions, and that female patients, particularly those on combined oral contraceptives, may be more likely to develop a rash.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that mild increases in blood-pressure were also reported, but considered that this is of unknown clinical significance. The Subcommittee however considered that if this medication allows CF patients to live longer, then prevention of age-related conditions such as coronary artery disease or stroke may become more important. The Subcommittee noted that eye-problems have been reported in other studies involving IVA, but that the ELX/TEZ/IVA studies were not well set up to detect these. The Subcommittee also noted that there are post marketing reports of 7 patients who had testicular pain in the first week of drug initiation, but that this could reasonably be expected with hydration of the lumen of an obstructed vas deferens (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32471772/\" target=\"_blank\">Rotolo et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2020;19:e39-41</a>). Overall, the Subcommittee considered that there is significant uncertainty in evaluating the risks, particularly long-term risks, until long term safety studies and real-world clinical cohort follow up studies have been completed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence indicates that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides patients with substantial improvements in quality life and an expectation of substantial prolongation of life; and that the medication can significantly improve sweat chloride measurements, often to the normal range, which is <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">the best available surrogate marker for CFTR function in the internal organs</span>. The Subcommittee considered that good efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been observed across subgroups including with different genotypes, and that results supporting a clinical benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA have been consistent between randomised controlled trials, in before-and after analyses in open label efficacy studies and in real world cohorts. The Subcommittee considered that results were durable between timepoints within randomised controlled trials or open label extension studies.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the randomised controlled trials employed appropriate methods for statistical analysis, choice of control intervention, randomisation, allocation, blinding and were well matched at baseline, and that although study participant numbers were relatively small that these were appropriate and sufficiently powered given the large effect size of the ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee also considered that the outcome variables measured were generally appropriate and that future trials could attempt to measure patient-centred outcome variables and quality of life more directly. The Subcommittee considered that given the biological plausibility, improvement in sweat chloride and ppFEV1, that it is likely that any study reporting patient-centred outcome measures will also show positive results.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there were many demographics not included in the clinical trials; those taking prohibited concomitant medications, pregnant individuals, people with organ transplants, patients with cancer, patients with alcohol or drug use, those with comorbidities, and those with certain infections. The Subcommittee considered that exclusion of these patients may limit the generalisability of the results to the real-world context, as many CF patients will experience one or more of the factors listed.</p><p><br></p><p><i>General comments</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA could allow patients with CF to live a nearly normal life, but also considered that a number of patients living in New Zealand already have structural lung, pancreatic and other organ damage that would not be undone by correcting CFTR activity with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and these patients would have to remain on a variety of other medications. The Subcommittee considered that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a paradigm-shifting treatment for patients with CF, in that it treats the cause of CF rather than its symptoms.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CFQ-R respiratory domain measure is a well validated tool and the most commonly used measure of respiratory-related quality of life in cystic fibrosis trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that it may not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it is difficult to translate changes in CFQ-R to quality adjusted life years, but that it could reasonably serve as a surrogate measure. The Subcommittee considered that there is some uncertainty surrounding a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R but noted that the reported change in CFQ-R for patients receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA was clinically meaningful well beyond the MCID. The Subcommittee noted that other CFQ dimensions reported in ELX/TEZ/IVA studies have also signalled benefits, with the exception of digestive health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that LCI was used as an endpoint in the trials for patients aged 6-11 years. The Subcommittee noted that LCI measures heterogeneity of ventilation, whereas ppFEV1 measures large airway calibre, and that the two measures provide different and independent ways to measure lung function. However, the Subcommittee considered that they will correlate somewhat with each other to some degree, as they both evaluate lung function. The Subcommittee noted that in younger patients with early disease, ppFEV1 may be nearly normal, and that LCI is a sensitive marker of lung disease and is more likely to be abnormal for patients with CF in this age group. The Subcommittee considered that LCI may be a more responsive measure of treatment effect in this age group, as it can be difficult for younger patients to perform spirometry reliably for ppFEV1. The Subcommittee noted that there is no readily agreed upon MCID for LCI, but considered that the reported improvements in LCI with ELX/TEZ/IVA (eg. 1.7 units in study 106 and 2.2 units in study 116) indicate a significant effect size. The Subcommittee noted that LCI is not readily available as a clinical measurement in New Zealand, and therefore it would not be appropriate to include in any eligibility criteria for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.38.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, like ppFEV1, worsening LCI correlates with exacerbations, worse quality of life and prognosis, and considered that it is an appropriate measure of lung function for use in clinical trials, particularly in the paediatric age group. The Subcommittee considered that both LCI and ppFEV1 are measures of lung function and probably reflect a combination of thick secretions in the airway and airway wall inflammation, but that neither correlates perfectly with quality of life or patient-centred outcomes such as being able to live independently, work, form adult relationships, or having the ability to carry out everyday tasks. The Subcommittee considered that no readily measurable outcome variable can encompass the multiple dimensions that contribute to CF morbidity, disease progression and risk.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.39.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is a small proportion of CF patients for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA would be less effective, namely: those patients with genetic mutations unresponsive in vitro (these patients are not included in considerations for this application), those intolerant to ELX/TEZ/IVA, those with gating mutations who are well treated with IVA alone, those for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA may be contraindicated due to morbidity (such as severe baseline liver disease, or concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers), and those with qualifying genetic mutations who may have less severe disease. The Subcommittee noted that the latter are sometimes referred to as patients with CFTR-related disorder or CFTR-related metabolic syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that patients with these conditions may have one F mutation and another that is unknown but that they should not have received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The Subcommittee considered that as a result, approximately 10% of CF patients in New Zealand would not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.40.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 60 patients in New Zealand with CF and no F mutation (who are not included in the patient population considered for this application), and that approximately 10 of those have a gating mutation that may be eligible for treatment with IVA. The Committee noted that, of the remainder, approximately 10 CF patients have mutations where in-vitro testing suggests that ELX/TEZ/IVA will be effective; and considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded that Pharmac may consider extending access to these patients and that it would be important for these patients to have confirmed sweat chloride levels of at least 60 mmol/L. The Subcommittee noted that this would represent a small number of CF patients in New Zealand eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if funded. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to infer a similar benefit from ELX/TEZ/IVA for this patient group, noting the way drug development had occurred for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.41.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to define a patient population with CF at highest risk morbidity and mortality but noted that patients with higher rates of infection and exacerbations, mutations associated with more severe disease, and ppFEV1 &lt;40 are at the highest risk of hospitalisation, mortality, and have the poorest quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it was similarly difficult to define a CF patient population that would benefit most from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA, as treatment has demonstrated substantial and similarly meaningful improvements in quality of life and symptom burden for both those with progressed disease and younger patients who have not yet developed significant organ damage or lung impairment.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.42.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no data regarding the dosage, efficacy and safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA for the patient population under 6 years of age, and that there is currently no evidence to suggest this group would be more or less likely to benefit than those included in current and published clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that due to the robustness of the study results across age groups to date that ELX/TEZ/IVA is likely to be as effective in this age group, causing the relatively preserved lung function of early-stage disease occurring with younger age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.43.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the reduced improvements in clinical trial endpoints seen in patients with F/RF mutations in the clinical trials compared with those with other mutations was likely because F/RF mutations are usually associated with less severe disease, and that the F/RF group was compared with an active comparator in the trial, as opposed to placebo. The Subcommittee considered that, in this context, the results were similarly impressive and suggested that important clinical benefits can come from the addition of ELX to TEZ/IVA even in this less severe patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.44.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume that the 6 to 11-year-old age group would experience a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that this would be to a similar extent to that observed in the 12 years and older age group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.45.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded, it could reasonably increase the prevalence of the disease. The Subcommittee noted that improved survival would likely lead to a higher prevalence of CF (through incident patients surviving longer), and that improved health, vitality and fertility in people with CF may lead to an increase in children born to CF parents and so to an increased incidence and prevalence of CF in the community over time. The Subcommittee considered that at this time, there is no way to quantify to what degree this may affect patient numbers in the future.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.46.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an American study that reported treatment adherence to IVA and LUM/IVA to be 84%, and adherence to TEZ/IVA to be 92% (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33968464/\" target=\"_blank\">Mehta et al. J Drug Assess. 2021;10:62-67</a>). The Subcommittee considered that given the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA, adherence to this treatment is likely to be greater than 92% if it were to be funded in New Zealand. However, the Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that overall adherence rate reduction would be driven by few patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.47.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in the French cohort described above (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33600738/\" target=\"_blank\">Burgel et al. 2021</a>), of 53 CF patients evaluated for transplantation only 7 were transplanted or awaiting transplant, the remainder having the indication for transplant suspended following treatment induction with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that there was a 50% reduction in the rate of lung transplants for CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that these were patients with pre-existing lung damage, and that with time it is likely that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may prevent severe lung disease from developing in the first place, further reducing the need for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that there is not sufficient evidence at this time to ascertain if lung transplants for these patients would be deferred to a later time in life, or if the need would be ultimately reduced. However, the Subcommittee considered the supplier\u2019s estimate of a reduction in lung transplants of approximately 80% to be reasonable, but that this would likely occur over some time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.48.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">The Subcommittee considered that estimates of health utility correlated to clinical ppFEV1 characteristics were reasonable, </span>however, that as this metric is respiratory disease-specific it does not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life<span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">. </span>The Subcommittee noted that lung function represents only one aspect of health and thus correlates only modestly with quality of life, and that other dimensions may be measured with the CFQ-R or exacerbation frequency. The Subcommittee considered that while it is unknown how well improvement in one measure of the CFQ-R correlates with improvement in another and the overall impact on quality of life, <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">all measures have shown substantial mean improvement on treatment and have improved to a similar extent as lung function. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to expect health utility to improve similarly. The Subcommittee also considered that CF patients may experience other significant morbidities while preserving relatively good lung function with BSC, such as pancreatic issues and morbidity associated with treatment burden, and that these are not well captured when using ppFEV1 as a means of grouping patients. The Subcommittee considered that CF patients with mild disease still experience significant CF-related morbidity and treatment burden, and considered that their health utility would be expected to be worse than with full health, even with a ppFEV1 &gt;90%. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable however to relate inpatients healthcare costs to underlying lung function as a surrogate for overall wellbeing, in the absence of more detailed specific information to inform on this. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.49.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that estimates of the health sector cost of a pulmonary exacerbation event vary markedly, and that there is likely to be significant variation in costs between patients and exacerbations at different life stages. The Subcommittee noted that a two-week hospital admission can cost up to $40,000 per patient, but that this may vary widely between health providers.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.50.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that over time there would be an 80% reduction in the use of BSC. The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple clinical trials underway investigating the withdrawal of BSC from the CF treatment regimen in conjunction with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, however that there is limited data at this time to inform this. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to assume that outpatient costs for CF patients would decrease over time with access to ELX/TEZ/IVA, noting though that monitoring, and the associated check-ups would increase with patients living longer.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.51.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients may not require as frequent adjustments to their antibiotic treatment strategy as occurs with best supportive care. The Subcommittee considered that antibiotic use would decrease substantially for patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, particularly intravenous and nebulised antibiotics. The Subcommittee considered that there would be a substantial reduction in the need for nebulised hypertonic saline, dornase alfa and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that hospitalisations would likely decrease, due to decreased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations for this patient group. The Subcommittee however considered it likely that those with CF-related diabetes and/or pancreatic insufficiency will still have these morbidities after starting treatment, but that the younger cohort without CF-related diabetes might avoid this complication by using ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.52.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, given the magnitude of benefit seen so far in clinical trials, it is likely that there will be significant overall survival improvement in the patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted, however, that there is not yet sufficiently long-term evidence to support this, but nonetheless considered it reasonable to infer a long-term survival benefit for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.53.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the patients who are currently taking IVA who are eligible for both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA (ie. those with F/gating mutations), perhaps 80% would switch to ELX/TEZ/IVA, due to the potential greater efficacy as demonstrated in Study 104. The Subcommittee noted that there are 17 patients currently on the New Zealand CF register to whom this would apply, but that some of these patients are under six years of age and would thus not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee considered that the eligible CF population in New Zealand would be 388 patients, increasing to approximately 430 over five years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.54.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high cost of this treatment and eligible patients would expect considerable benefit from treatment if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded. The Subcommittee considered that this would likely affect Pharmac\u2019s ability to fund this treatment for this patient group, given that it would have a very significant impact on the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.55.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CF patients meeting the proposed eligibility criteria. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><table class=\"ql-table-blob\" border=\"0\" style=\"width: 460.45pt;\" width=\"614\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 22.1pt;\"><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 75.3pt;

The Subcommittee noted that CF is characterised by multisystem organ impairment, substantial morbidity, and premature death.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that functioning CFTR pumps chloride ions into the extracellular space, which hydrates exocrine secretions. The Subcommittee noted that a defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis, which leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems. The Subcommittee noted that the build-up of these secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the most common mutations of CFTR can be classed as deletions in the F508 gene (F), and can be classified as minimal function (MF), gating (G), residual function (RF) or other; F/F patients are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (have two copies of F508del); F/RF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a residual function (RF) mutation in the other allele; F/G patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a gating (G) mutation in the other allele; F/MF patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation in the other allele; F/R117H patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a R117H mutation in the other allele; F/other patients are heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a second allele that is unknown and/or has not yet been characterised as gating, RF or MF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pulmonary exacerbations, malnutrition, infections, and other complications further reduce the quality of life and life expectancy of CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that CF leads to frequent hospitalisations and is a common cause for lung transplant, and that a substantial proportion of hospital respiratory inpatient admissions are for complications of CF.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters (from former CF Panel) considered that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Subcommittee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that patients with CF have significant emotional, symptom, and treatment-related burden in day-to-day life and that the reduction in life expectancy has a significant negative impact for these patients. The Subcommittee noted that the median age of CF patients in New Zealand is 18 years while the median age of the New Zealand population is 37, and over 40% of CF patients are aged less than 16 years compared with 19% in the general population. The Subcommittee considered that this reflected the significant morbidity and mortality experienced by this patient group. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 540 patients with CF in New Zealand (all ages and genotypes) and noted that CF registry data available is from 2017 and does not include patients who have undergone lung transplants.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently the majority of CF patients receive \u201cbest supportive care\u201d (BSC), which includes mucolytics, osmotic agents, antibiotics, bronchodilators, enzyme and vitamin replacements and supplements, and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee noted that the aim of best supportive care is to slow disease progression, maintain respiratory function, improve nutritional status, improve symptoms, and enhance quality of life. The Subcommittee noted that in addition to controlling symptoms, other treatment goals include preserving lung function and improving nutritional status, reducing the rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotics, and managing CF-related co-morbidities (eg. diabetes).\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that currently ivacaftor (IVA) is funded in New Zealand for CF-patients with specific gating (Class III) mutations but that this represents less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population. The Subcommittee noted that some of these patients will also have an F mutation and would thus be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were funded in New Zealand under the proposed access criteria.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that approximately 10% of the New Zealand CF population is made up of M\u0101ori and Pacific people, and that there is insufficient information to characterise these CF patients in terms of their CF mutational status. The Subcommittee considered that due to such small patient numbers, it is difficult to ascertain if M\u0101ori and Pacific patients have worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients, but considered this likely, noting that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters had considered that it was highly likely that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients would have worse outcomes, given that M\u0101ori and Pacific patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses have consistently worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori and non-Pacific patients. The Subcommittee noted that M\u0101ori and Pacific people are underrepresented in the group who may be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted that respiratory health and diabetes are described as Pharmac priority health areas of focus for M\u0101ori, however considered that CF-related bronchiectasis should not be conflated with non-CF bronchiectasis, this being a setting where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are over-represented, and that similarly CF-related diabetes should not be conflated with type 2 diabetes, where M\u0101ori and Pacific people are also overrepresented.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are a number of funded treatments for CF symptoms that are not funded for non-CF counterparts, such as insulin pumps, special foods, replacement glucose meters, sterile water (for hypertonic saline nebs), azithromycin (funded for children but not adults with non-CF bronchiectasis), colistin injection, gentamicin injection, tobramycin injection, tobramycin solution for inhalation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity. The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the majority of CF patient hospital admissions are for the treatment of respiratory infections and cited a study that reported that 75% of hospitalisations were coded as respiratory-related (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20967840/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephenson et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011;46:376-84</a>), and considered that many factors may predispose some CF patients to require more frequent hospitalisations, such as: poor lung function, CF-related diabetes, poor nutritional status, poor exercise performance, <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> infection, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> colonisation, poor medicine adherence, lower socioeconomic status, or having a high risk genotype such as F/F. The Subcommittee however considered that these factors in turn may be markers for more severe disease rather than an individual patient\u2019s predisposition to hospitalisation.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is likely a high variability in patients and their health care that influences the rate of lung function decline in CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that F/RF mutations are associated with slower rates of decline over time, as is adherence and access to best supportive care. The Subcommittee also noted that pulmonary exacerbations are generally thought to contribute to faster lung function decline. The Subcommittee noted that Cogen et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26061914/\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015;50:763-70</a>) reported that female gender, frequent or productive cough, low BMI, pulmonary exacerbations, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </i>infections caused greater lung function decline over time, while Harun et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259460/\" target=\"_blank\">Paediatr Pespir Rev. 2016;20:55-66</a>) reported that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection and pancreatic insufficiency contributed to an increased rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee considered that there is significant uncertainty in published data regarding the above factors and that the evidence overall is inconclusive.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CF treaters considered that adverse health events out of the patients control such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection or influenza can cause a more rapid decline, from which patients do not usually recover. The CF treaters considered that in general lung function decline is usually linear, but that there are clear instances where there is a stepwise drop in lung function related primarily to exacerbations, and that there is a correlation between frequency of exacerbations and the rate of lung function decline. The Subcommittee also noted that the CF treaters considered that the correlation between genotype and phenotype in CF patients is imperfect, and that two patients with the same mutations may not have the same rate of disease progression, but that in general mutational status indicative of more severe disease would almost certainly have an accelerated decline in lung function. In addition, the CF treaters considered that the rate of lung function decline was also driven by environmental factors, which would likely also be influenced by socioeconomic factors. The Subcommittee also noted that there are various other disease modifying genes known to affect CF severity and the rate of lung function decline, but that the effects of these have not been well characterised, and that testing for modifying genes is not widely available.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the New Zealand CF patient population would have comparable baseline characteristics to CF patients in the United Kingdom, due to the two populations being primarily Caucasian, but noted that the New Zealand patient population is relatively uninfluenced by CFTR modulator therapies and likely have less access to CF specialist clinics than their UK counterparts, which may contribute to the reduced average age of the CF population in New Zealand compared with the United Kingdom.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that overall, the strength and quality of evidence relating to the high health need of CF patient is excellent, both globally and in the New Zealand context, and noted the substantial evidence supporting the health need of this patient population provided by the supplier and CFNZ.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator with multiple modes of action; ELX and TEZ bind to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, and IVA potentiates functioning of this CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple definitions of pulmonary exacerbations throughout the literature and that in some instances severe pulmonary exacerbation is sometimes defined as a pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalisation. The Subcommittee considered that rates of exacerbations vary by definition and that no one definition is ideal or superior. The Subcommittee considered that a decrease in exacerbations by any definition in a clinical trial likely translates to a similar decrease in exacerbations defined by a different severity or defined by different criteria (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32682670/\" target=\"_blank\">Van Devanter et al.

The Subcommittee considered that it was an appropriately designed network meta-analysis that included consistent trial designs and study populations (limited to those aged 12 and over) for comparison, large effect sizes, consistent results across outcome measures, and evidence of a dose response that indicated that triple therapy (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was more effective than double or single therapies, which were in turn more effective than best supportive care.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that improvements in nutritional status and BMI were observed in all studies.

The Subcommittee also considered that the outcome variables measured were generally appropriate and that future trials could attempt to measure patient-centred outcome variables and quality of life more directly.

The Subcommittee considered that exclusion of these patients may limit the generalisability of the results to the real-world context, as many CF patients will experience one or more of the factors listed.</p><p><br></p><p><i>General comments</i></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA could allow patients with CF to live a nearly normal life, but also considered that a number of patients living in New Zealand already have structural lung, pancreatic and other organ damage that would not be undone by correcting CFTR activity with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and these patients would have to remain on a variety of other medications. The Subcommittee considered that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a paradigm-shifting treatment for patients with CF, in that it treats the cause of CF rather than its symptoms.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the CFQ-R respiratory domain measure is a well validated tool and the most commonly used measure of respiratory-related quality of life in cystic fibrosis trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that it may not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it is difficult to translate changes in CFQ-R to quality adjusted life years, but that it could reasonably serve as a surrogate measure. The Subcommittee considered that there is some uncertainty surrounding a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R but noted that the reported change in CFQ-R for patients receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA was clinically meaningful well beyond the MCID. The Subcommittee noted that other CFQ dimensions reported in ELX/TEZ/IVA studies have also signalled benefits, with the exception of digestive health.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that LCI was used as an endpoint in the trials for patients aged 6-11 years. The Subcommittee noted that LCI measures heterogeneity of ventilation, whereas ppFEV1 measures large airway calibre, and that the two measures provide different and independent ways to measure lung function. However, the Subcommittee considered that they will correlate somewhat with each other to some degree, as they both evaluate lung function. The Subcommittee noted that in younger patients with early disease, ppFEV1 may be nearly normal, and that LCI is a sensitive marker of lung disease and is more likely to be abnormal for patients with CF in this age group. The Subcommittee considered that LCI may be a more responsive measure of treatment effect in this age group, as it can be difficult for younger patients to perform spirometry reliably for ppFEV1. The Subcommittee noted that there is no readily agreed upon MCID for LCI, but considered that the reported improvements in LCI with ELX/TEZ/IVA (eg. 1.7 units in study 106 and 2.2 units in study 116) indicate a significant effect size. The Subcommittee noted that LCI is not readily available as a clinical measurement in New Zealand, and therefore it would not be appropriate to include in any eligibility criteria for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.38.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that, like ppFEV1, worsening LCI correlates with exacerbations, worse quality of life and prognosis, and considered that it is an appropriate measure of lung function for use in clinical trials, particularly in the paediatric age group. The Subcommittee considered that both LCI and ppFEV1 are measures of lung function and probably reflect a combination of thick secretions in the airway and airway wall inflammation, but that neither correlates perfectly with quality of life or patient-centred outcomes such as being able to live independently, work, form adult relationships, or having the ability to carry out everyday tasks. The Subcommittee considered that no readily measurable outcome variable can encompass the multiple dimensions that contribute to CF morbidity, disease progression and risk.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.39.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is a small proportion of CF patients for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA would be less effective, namely: those patients with genetic mutations unresponsive in vitro (these patients are not included in considerations for this application), those intolerant to ELX/TEZ/IVA, those with gating mutations who are well treated with IVA alone, those for whom ELX/TEZ/IVA may be contraindicated due to morbidity (such as severe baseline liver disease, or concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers), and those with qualifying genetic mutations who may have less severe disease. The Subcommittee noted that the latter are sometimes referred to as patients with CFTR-related disorder or CFTR-related metabolic syndrome. The Subcommittee noted that patients with these conditions may have one F mutation and another that is unknown but that they should not have received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The Subcommittee considered that as a result, approximately 10% of CF patients in New Zealand would not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.40.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 60 patients in New Zealand with CF and no F mutation (who are not included in the patient population considered for this application), and that approximately 10 of those have a gating mutation that may be eligible for treatment with IVA. The Committee noted that, of the remainder, approximately 10 CF patients have mutations where in-vitro testing suggests that ELX/TEZ/IVA will be effective; and considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded that Pharmac may consider extending access to these patients and that it would be important for these patients to have confirmed sweat chloride levels of at least 60 mmol/L. The Subcommittee noted that this would represent a small number of CF patients in New Zealand eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA if funded. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable to infer a similar benefit from ELX/TEZ/IVA for this patient group, noting the way drug development had occurred for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.41.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that it was difficult to define a patient population with CF at highest risk morbidity and mortality but noted that patients with higher rates of infection and exacerbations, mutations associated with more severe disease, and ppFEV1 &lt;40 are at the highest risk of hospitalisation, mortality, and have the poorest quality of life. The Subcommittee considered that it was similarly difficult to define a CF patient population that would benefit most from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA, as treatment has demonstrated substantial and similarly meaningful improvements in quality of life and symptom burden for both those with progressed disease and younger patients who have not yet developed significant organ damage or lung impairment.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.42.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is currently no data regarding the dosage, efficacy and safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA for the patient population under 6 years of age, and that there is currently no evidence to suggest this group would be more or less likely to benefit than those included in current and published clinical trials. The Subcommittee considered, however, that due to the robustness of the study results across age groups to date that ELX/TEZ/IVA is likely to be as effective in this age group, causing the relatively preserved lung function of early-stage disease occurring with younger age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.43.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the reduced improvements in clinical trial endpoints seen in patients with F/RF mutations in the clinical trials compared with those with other mutations was likely because F/RF mutations are usually associated with less severe disease, and that the F/RF group was compared with an active comparator in the trial, as opposed to placebo. The Subcommittee considered that, in this context, the results were similarly impressive and suggested that important clinical benefits can come from the addition of ELX to TEZ/IVA even in this less severe patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.44.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, based on the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume that the 6 to 11-year-old age group would experience a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that this would be to a similar extent to that observed in the 12 years and older age group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.45.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded, it could reasonably increase the prevalence of the disease. The Subcommittee noted that improved survival would likely lead to a higher prevalence of CF (through incident patients surviving longer), and that improved health, vitality and fertility in people with CF may lead to an increase in children born to CF parents and so to an increased incidence and prevalence of CF in the community over time. The Subcommittee considered that at this time, there is no way to quantify to what degree this may affect patient numbers in the future.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.46.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted an American study that reported treatment adherence to IVA and LUM/IVA to be 84%, and adherence to TEZ/IVA to be 92% (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33968464/\" target=\"_blank\">Mehta et al. J Drug Assess. 2021;10:62-67</a>). The Subcommittee considered that given the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA, adherence to this treatment is likely to be greater than 92% if it were to be funded in New Zealand. However, the Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that overall adherence rate reduction would be driven by few patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.47.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that in the French cohort described above (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33600738/\" target=\"_blank\">Burgel et al. 2021</a>), of 53 CF patients evaluated for transplantation only 7 were transplanted or awaiting transplant, the remainder having the indication for transplant suspended following treatment induction with ELX/TEZ/IVA, and that there was a 50% reduction in the rate of lung transplants for CF patients. The Subcommittee noted that these were patients with pre-existing lung damage, and that with time it is likely that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may prevent severe lung disease from developing in the first place, further reducing the need for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that there is not sufficient evidence at this time to ascertain if lung transplants for these patients would be deferred to a later time in life, or if the need would be ultimately reduced. However, the Subcommittee considered the supplier\u2019s estimate of a reduction in lung transplants of approximately 80% to be reasonable, but that this would likely occur over some time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.48.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">The Subcommittee considered that estimates of health utility correlated to clinical ppFEV1 characteristics were reasonable, </span>however, that as this metric is respiratory disease-specific it does not capture the full multidimensional impact of cystic fibrosis on quality of life<span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">. </span>The Subcommittee noted that lung function represents only one aspect of health and thus correlates only modestly with quality of life, and that other dimensions may be measured with the CFQ-R or exacerbation frequency. The Subcommittee considered that while it is unknown how well improvement in one measure of the CFQ-R correlates with improvement in another and the overall impact on quality of life, <span style=\"color: rgb(28, 29, 30);\">all measures have shown substantial mean improvement on treatment and have improved to a similar extent as lung function. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to expect health utility to improve similarly. The Subcommittee also considered that CF patients may experience other significant morbidities while preserving relatively good lung function with BSC, such as pancreatic issues and morbidity associated with treatment burden, and that these are not well captured when using ppFEV1 as a means of grouping patients. The Subcommittee considered that CF patients with mild disease still experience significant CF-related morbidity and treatment burden, and considered that their health utility would be expected to be worse than with full health, even with a ppFEV1 &gt;90%. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable however to relate inpatients healthcare costs to underlying lung function as a surrogate for overall wellbeing, in the absence of more detailed specific information to inform on this. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.49.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that estimates of the health sector cost of a pulmonary exacerbation event vary markedly, and that there is likely to be significant variation in costs between patients and exacerbations at different life stages. The Subcommittee noted that a two-week hospital admission can cost up to $40,000 per patient, but that this may vary widely between health providers.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.50.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the CF treaters\u2019 consideration that over time there would be an 80% reduction in the use of BSC. The Subcommittee noted that there are multiple clinical trials underway investigating the withdrawal of BSC from the CF treatment regimen in conjunction with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, however that there is limited data at this time to inform this. The Subcommittee considered that it is reasonable to assume that outpatient costs for CF patients would decrease over time with access to ELX/TEZ/IVA, noting though that monitoring, and the associated check-ups would increase with patients living longer.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.51.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients may not require as frequent adjustments to their antibiotic treatment strategy as occurs with best supportive care. The Subcommittee considered that antibiotic use would decrease substantially for patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, particularly intravenous and nebulised antibiotics. The Subcommittee considered that there would be a substantial reduction in the need for nebulised hypertonic saline, dornase alfa and chest physiotherapy. The Subcommittee also considered that hospitalisations would likely decrease, due to decreased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations for this patient group. The Subcommittee however considered it likely that those with CF-related diabetes and/or pancreatic insufficiency will still have these morbidities after starting treatment, but that the younger cohort without CF-related diabetes might avoid this complication by using ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.52.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that, given the magnitude of benefit seen so far in clinical trials, it is likely that there will be significant overall survival improvement in the patients treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee noted, however, that there is not yet sufficiently long-term evidence to support this, but nonetheless considered it reasonable to infer a long-term survival benefit for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.53.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that of the patients who are currently taking IVA who are eligible for both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA (ie. those with F/gating mutations), perhaps 80% would switch to ELX/TEZ/IVA, due to the potential greater efficacy as demonstrated in Study 104. The Subcommittee noted that there are 17 patients currently on the New Zealand CF register to whom this would apply, but that some of these patients are under six years of age and would thus not be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Subcommittee considered that the eligible CF population in New Zealand would be 388 patients, increasing to approximately 430 over five years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.54.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the high cost of this treatment and eligible patients would expect considerable benefit from treatment if ELX/TEZ/IVA were funded. The Subcommittee considered that this would likely affect Pharmac\u2019s ability to fund this treatment for this patient group, given that it would have a very significant impact on the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.55.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ELX/TEZ/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CF patients meeting the proposed eligibility criteria. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><br></p><table class=\"ql-table-blob\" border=\"0\" style=\"width: 460.45pt;\" width=\"614\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 22.1pt;\"><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 75.3pt;

The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori patients with cystic fibrosis to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori cystic fibrosis patient population. However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori. Treatment of cystic fibrosis falls under the Government health priority of child wellbeing, as well being a chronic respiratory disease, which is one of the Government Health Priority conditions. Respiratory health is M\u0101ori health area of focus identified in Te Whaioranga.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">711.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee reviewed the application for ELX/TEZ/IVA for the treatment for CF at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-08-26-Respiratory-Subcommittee-record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2021</a> meeting, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2020;8:65-124</a>). The Committee considered that variations in genotype by ethnicity in New Zealand are unknown at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori and Pacific patients with CF to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori CF patient population. The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support. The Committee noted that there seems to be a shift in CF therapeutics development from highly specific targets to more generalised off-target CFTR effects.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator which binds to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, as well as potentiating the functioning of CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following published trials relating to the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF in patients with at least one F508del mutation:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.21.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 102 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282384/\" target=\"_blank\">Middleton et al.

The sweat chloride concentration had a mean change from baseline of -22.3 mmol/L in the ELZ/TEZ/IVA treated group (95% CI -24.5 to -20.2) compared with 0.7 mmol/L in the active control group (95% CI -1.4 to 2.8; between-group difference -23.1 mmol/L; 95% CI -26.1 to -20.1; p&lt;0.001). The ELX/TEZ/IVA treated group achieved a mean difference of 10.3 in CFQ-R respiratory domain score (95% CI 8.0 to 12.7) compared with 1.6 in the active control group (95% CI -0.8 to 4.1; between-group difference 8.7; 95% CI 5.3 to 12.1).

Patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks. F/F patients had a mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 12.2 (95% CI 7.2 to 15.2; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change in sweat chloride of -70.4 mmol/L (95% CI -75.6 to -63.3; p&lt;0.0001), a mean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI 3.9 to 10.1), and a mean absolute change from baseline in lung clearance index (LCI2.5) of -1.64 (95% CI -2.34 to -0.94).

The Committee considered the strength and quality of evidence to be good overall but noted the lack of longer-term evidence and the variation between trial designs, specifically with regard to eligibility criteria and treatment run-in periods. The Committee considered that ppFEV1 is an important clinical outcome for these patients but that it does not comprehensively inform on a patient\u2019s overall lung function, and that 4-week studies are too short in duration to accurately measure any change. The Committee noted that there were few patients who discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to adverse events, and that reported adherence rates were high for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the only currently available CFTR modulator in New Zealand is ivacaftor, which is available for less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population as it targets a specific subset of mutations. The Committee noted that the comparator treatment to ELX/TEZ/IVA for the majority of the New Zealand CF patient population is best supportive care. The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion. The Committee noted that funding of ELX/TEZ/IVA would expand the patient population eligible for CFTR modulator treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the risks and benefits of treating those aged 6-11 years or 12 years and over would be similar in that treatment would be expected to alter the baseline progression of disease for all age groups. The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I.

The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al.

However, the Committee also considered that the available data is very limited, and that there is not enough information available to extrapolate the magnitude of long-term benefit.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there may need to be an effective way of managing access for these patients and that a permissive Special Authority criterion may not effectively target treatment to those patients for whom a benefit would be expected. The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget. The Committee considered that this was an important factor in the context of the lack of long term follow up data that exists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for </span>ELX/TEZ/IVA <span style=\"color: black;\">if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of CF in patients over the age of 12 with at least one F508del mutation.

The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori patients with cystic fibrosis to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori cystic fibrosis patient population. However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori. Treatment of cystic fibrosis falls under the Government health priority of child wellbeing, as well being a chronic respiratory disease, which is one of the Government Health Priority conditions. Respiratory health is M\u0101ori health area of focus identified in Te Whaioranga.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">711.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee reviewed the application for ELX/TEZ/IVA for the treatment for CF at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-08-26-Respiratory-Subcommittee-record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2021</a> meeting, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2020;8:65-124</a>). The Committee considered that variations in genotype by ethnicity in New Zealand are unknown at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori and Pacific patients with CF to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori CF patient population. The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support. The Committee noted that there seems to be a shift in CF therapeutics development from highly specific targets to more generalised off-target CFTR effects.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator which binds to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, as well as potentiating the functioning of CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following published trials relating to the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF in patients with at least one F508del mutation:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.21.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 102 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282384/\" target=\"_blank\">Middleton et al.

The Committee considered the strength and quality of evidence to be good overall but noted the lack of longer-term evidence and the variation between trial designs, specifically with regard to eligibility criteria and treatment run-in periods. The Committee considered that ppFEV1 is an important clinical outcome for these patients but that it does not comprehensively inform on a patient\u2019s overall lung function, and that 4-week studies are too short in duration to accurately measure any change. The Committee noted that there were few patients who discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to adverse events, and that reported adherence rates were high for ELX/TEZ/IVA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the only currently available CFTR modulator in New Zealand is ivacaftor, which is available for less than 10% of the New Zealand CF population as it targets a specific subset of mutations. The Committee noted that the comparator treatment to ELX/TEZ/IVA for the majority of the New Zealand CF patient population is best supportive care. The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion. The Committee noted that funding of ELX/TEZ/IVA would expand the patient population eligible for CFTR modulator treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the risks and benefits of treating those aged 6-11 years or 12 years and over would be similar in that treatment would be expected to alter the baseline progression of disease for all age groups. The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I.

The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al.

However, the Committee also considered that the available data is very limited, and that there is not enough information available to extrapolate the magnitude of long-term benefit.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there may need to be an effective way of managing access for these patients and that a permissive Special Authority criterion may not effectively target treatment to those patients for whom a benefit would be expected. The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget. The Committee considered that this was an important factor in the context of the lack of long term follow up data that exists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for </span>ELX/TEZ/IVA <span style=\"color: black;\">if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of CF in patients over the age of 12 with at least one F508del mutation.

The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori patients with cystic fibrosis to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori cystic fibrosis patient population. However, the Committee noted the Respiratory Subcommittee consideration that it was likely that M\u0101ori with cystic fibrosis would experience worse outcomes than non-M\u0101ori. Treatment of cystic fibrosis falls under the Government health priority of child wellbeing, as well being a chronic respiratory disease, which is one of the Government Health Priority conditions. Respiratory health is M\u0101ori health area of focus identified in Te Whaioranga.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">711.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee reviewed the application for ELX/TEZ/IVA for the treatment for CF at its <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-08-26-Respiratory-Subcommittee-record-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2021</a> meeting, where it was recommended for funding with a high priority. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee recommended access for patients greater than 6 years of age for a wide range of patients to align with FDA eligible mutations (listed on table 5 of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>) and considered that this criteria included eligibility for patients with mutations for which benefit is not currently supported by evidence of benefit in patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, genetic and progressive disease which causes multisystem organ impairment and premature death as a result of a defective CFTR protein. This defective CFTR protein results in defective transport of chloride and other ions across the surface of epithelial cells and causes a disruption in fluid homeostasis. The Committee noted that this leads to the production and retention of thick secretions in multiple organ systems and that this build-up of secretions has serious clinical consequences for multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive system. The Committee also noted that psychological problems for patients also arise, due to the high associated symptom and treatment burden, and living with a terminal illness from a young age.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that advances in best supportive care over the last decade have improved life expectancy for patients with CF by 10-15 years, and that the current life expectancy of patients with CF in New Zealand is approximately 35-45 years. The Committee noted that CF is a disease with a variable rate of progression over time, but that the health need for patients may increase as they age due to accumulating symptom and treatment burden and associated lung and organ dysfunction over time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that patients\u2019 day-to-day symptom burden is high and includes cough and high production of sputum, frequent infections, loss of lung function over time, as well as having to regularly take time off school or work, and that some patients are restricted to part time education or work as a result. The Committee also noted that caregivers of CF patients also regularly must take time off work to support their dependents. The Committee also noted that the daily treatment burden of CF is high and increases with age and disease severity and that daily treatment can include three to four hours of nebulised treatments, in addition to regular clinical visits with specialists, regular hospitalisations, and having to take multiple other medications daily. The Committee also noted that the CF Registry (maintained by Cystic Fibrosis New Zealand) contains substantial information on patient level outcomes from CF (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>). The Committee considered that it would be useful to obtain the relevant clinical considerations for patients with CF in New Zealand from the CF registry.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the New Zealand Cystic Fibrosis Registry from 2017 cites that there are 498 CF patients in New Zealand but that this excludes those who have undergone lung transplant. The Committee also noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee referenced a prevalence of 540 patients with CF in New Zealand and noted that it was unclear how this population estimate was provided. The Committee noted that due to the way in which the data is presented in the CF Registry reports it is difficult to extrapolate exactly how many children aged 6 and under have CF in New Zealand, however the Committee, based on the CF registry data, estimated approximately 390 patients would be over the age of 7 and would expect a slightly larger patient number for those over 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted further information from the CF Registry outlining further health needs of patients and their wh\u0101nau, including that over half of CF patients are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, approximately a third of adults with CF and approximately 11% of children with CF have CF related diabetes</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CF can be caused by various mutations which can be grouped into classes (protein production, protein processing, gating, conduction, and insufficient protein), which pertain to specific defects, but which sometimes overlap. The Committee noted that diagnostic assays for CF and the reporting of CFTR variant frequencies are optimised for European populations and may contribute to underrepresentation of CF incidence and prevalence worldwide in non-European populations, for example that the F508del mutation is absent from populations with predominantly East Asian ancestry though CF is still prevalent in these populations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570318/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell et al. Lancet Respir Med. 2020;8:65-124</a>). The Committee considered that variations in genotype by ethnicity in New Zealand are unknown at this time.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is insufficient evidence relating to M\u0101ori and Pacific patients with CF to determine if they are overrepresented or have worse outcomes than the non-M\u0101ori CF patient population. The Committee noted a study by McGarry et al. which found that patients with CF from minority groups are less likely to have mutations what would make them eligible for CFTR modulator treatment (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470563/\" target=\"_blank\">McGarry et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021;56:1496-1503</a>). The Committee also noted that McGarry et al. reported that the FEV1 percentage for minority groups who were not eligible for CFTR modulators was similar to that of non-Hispanic white patients who were eligible for CFTR modulators and considered that this could indicate that genotypes ineligible for CFTR modulators may have similar disease phenotypes. The Committee noted that there is a concern regarding certain mutations not consistently representing a phenotype.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19. </span>The Committee noted that there are a number of therapeutics in development for CF, including CFTR modulator therapies, therapies for mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory treatments, anti-infectives, gene therapies, and nutritional support. The Committee noted that there seems to be a shift in CF therapeutics development from highly specific targets to more generalised off-target CFTR effects.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ELX/TEZ/IVA is a CFTR modulator which binds to different sites on normal and F508del-CFTR proteins to increase processing and trafficking to the epithelial cell surface, as well as potentiating the functioning of CTFR protein by increasing channel gating and enhancing chloride transport.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the following published trials relating to the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF in patients with at least one F508del mutation:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.21.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>Study 102 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282384/\" target=\"_blank\">Middleton et al.

The Committee noted that approximately 87% of the current CF patient population have at least one F508del mutation (<a href=\"https://www.cfnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/cf3fb19c08/Port-CF-2017-NZ-CF-Data-Registry-1-v2.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Port CF Data Registry, 2017 Registry Report, Cystic Fibrosis NZ</a>) and would be eligible for ELX/TE/IVA if it were to be funded in New Zealand, without accounting for age as an eligibility criterion. The Committee noted that funding of ELX/TEZ/IVA would expand the patient population eligible for CFTR modulator treatment.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the risks and benefits of treating those aged 6-11 years or 12 years and over would be similar in that treatment would be expected to alter the baseline progression of disease for all age groups. The Committee noted, however, that those aged 12 years or over are more likely to be symptomatic at the time of treatment initiation, and will thus have a more measurable improvement, whereas those aged 6-11 years will have a less measurable improvement having not yet experienced significant disease progression in line with the considerations of the Respiratory Subcommittee. The Committee noted that there is insufficient data on the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF patient aged under 6 years but considered that treating this younger age group with CFTR modulators may prevent or delay disease worsening over time, which may prevent or delay the development of CF related comorbidities such as pancreatic insufficiency or malabsorption.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>There Committee considered that there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA for some genotypes and classes of mutations. The Committee noted that while the pivotal trials were open to a large and variable panel of mutations, there is no information on which mutations were actually present in those enrolled in the studies and noted that not all mutations could have been represented as there were more eligible mutations listed in the trial protocol than there were participants in the trials themselves. The Committee considered that it is likely that there are common phenotypes within mutation classes as opposed to mutation specific phenotypes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the Special Authority criteria suggested by the Respiratory Subcommittee for ELX/TEZ/IVA included all mutations listed in Table 5 of the <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/212273s004lbl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FDA highlights of prescribing information June 2021</a>, which includes mutations for which there is only <i>in vitro</i> evidence of effect and which requires extrapolation for efficacy <i>in vivo. </i>The Committee noted that this seems to be a normal practice in CF treatment research, but also noted that there is active debate in the literature as to whether all <i>in vitro</i> benefits translate into <i>in vivo</i> benefit in CFTR mutations. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Subcommittee also recommended funding for patients with cystic fibrosis-causing genes, including F508del, G551D and other mutations listed as cystic-fibrosis causing at <a href=\"http://www.cftr2.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cftr2.org</a>. The Committee noted that the FDA is allowing access to patients with mutations which have had an <i>in vitro </i>response to ELX/TEZ/IVA, but that European agencies are less permissive only allowing access to those who have mutations with a proven <i>in vivo </i>benefit. The Committee noted that while there is a common effect within a class of mutations, it is possible that approximately 20% of European CF patients may not be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy due to unproven benefits in rare mutations, and that approximately 10% of all patients with a CF phenotype may not have any CFTR to modulate at all <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34685773/\" target=\"_blank\">Fajac I. Sermet I. Cells. 2021;10:2793</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.28.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that advice should be sought from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding whether a phenotypic definition of CF may be a more appropriate than genotypic criteria for access, given the desire to achieve equity within the context of potentially inequitable testing and the concerns regarding the extrapolation of benefit from response of certain mutations to ELX/TEZ/IVA in vitro.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.29.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that quality of life in the ELX/TEZ/IVA pivotal studies was measured using CFQ-R respiratory domain scores. The Committee noted that the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in CFQ-R score on treatment compared to baseline is approximately 8-10 points for exacerbations and approximately 4 points in a stable state (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447923/\" target=\"_blank\">Quittner et al. Chest. 2009;135:1610-18</a>). The Committee noted that all studies reported a CFQ-R respiratory domain score above the MCID and considered these scores to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered, based on the clinically meaningful improvement in CFQ-R, the health utility of patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA would similarly improve.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable to assume (in line with the Respiratory Subcommittee) that there would be a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations in the 6\u201311-year-old age group after receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee noted that patients under the age of 6 are unlikely to be symptomatic and considered that treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA may not coincide as directly with a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that while longer term data is expected for all age groups for whom funding has been requested, at this time, there is insufficient data to assess long-term outcomes from treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered ppFEV1 to not be an evidenced surrogate for ongoing exacerbations from the published trial data, in that Study 102 provided the only published data to support a reduction in exacerbations. The Committee considered that this would become known with longer follow up data from the other clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.31.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted an indirect treatment comparison conducted by the supplier which compared the efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA over 24-weeks to other relevant treatment options in patients with F508del homozygous or heterozygous mutations. The Committee noted that all of the studies had run in periods and differences in baseline measurements such as ppFEV1. The Committee noted that the indirect treatment comparison used data from Study 109 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04105972?term=NCT04105972&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">NCT04105972</a><u>)</u>, which has not yet been published, and considered that this put the validity of the indirect comparison to question, as it is not clear if the patient population in study 109 is an appropriate representation of the F508del homozygous population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.32.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was uncertainty around the long-term consequences of using CFTR modulator therapies, and if CF patients will in fact experience near-normal lifespans. The Committee considered that it was unknown if incidence of CF-related comorbidities such CF-related diabetes or infertility would decrease. The Committee considered that there are no non-clinical features of the ELX/TEZ/IVA tablet that may impact on use, either by the patient, by family, or by healthcare workers, but noted that liquid formulations may need to be available if data emerges for efficacy in patients under the age of 6 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was unclear if medical service costs for CF patients would change if patients were receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to best supportive care. The Committee considered that there was uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact on the healthcare utilisation if ELX/TEZ/IVA funded and that this would be driven by extrapolation and uncertain assumptions. The Committee considered that the modelling put forth by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to reasonably reflect the health benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA over time (<a href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_CF_Evidence_Report_042720.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tice et al. Modulator Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis: Effectiveness and Value; Evidence Report. Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, April 27, 2020</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that overall, ELX/TEZ/IVA has strong biological plausibility for efficacy and very promising short-term data. However, the Committee also considered that the available data is very limited, and that there is not enough information available to extrapolate the magnitude of long-term benefit.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there may need to be an effective way of managing access for these patients and that a permissive Special Authority criterion may not effectively target treatment to those patients for whom a benefit would be expected. The Committee considered that it would be useful to seek further advice from the Respiratory Advisory Committee regarding the inclusion of renewal criteria that would effectively manage the uncertainty that exists in the data (eg reduction in exacerbations from baseline), in order to confirm benefit, and to consider whether a phenotypic criteria rather than one based on genotypes would enable more equitable access for this patient group. The Committee considered that it would be useful to investigate whether or not such access criteria exist in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.36.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the cost of ELX/TEZ/IVA was substantial and would impact the ability to fund other medicines from the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget. The Committee considered that this was an important factor in the context of the lack of long term follow up data that exists.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.37.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for </span>ELX/TEZ/IVA <span style=\"color: black;\">if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of CF in patients over the age of 12 with at least one F508del mutation. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

The Committee noted that there is population-wide newborn Guthrie screening, which detects about 90% of cases, and that patients who become symptomatic later in life would have phenotypic testing via a sweat chloride test in the first instance followed by genetic testing. The Committee noted that access to phenotypic testing was variable across centres. The Committee considered it unlikely that there would be disparities in screening and diagnosis for M\u0101ori.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Eligibility</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s and supplier\u2019s considerations that stopping criteria would be inappropriate for this patient population. The Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered it would be difficult to identify a group for which renewal criteria could apply, as it would be difficult to effectively incorporate the prevention of progression of CF versus clinical benefit from baseline, especially in younger patients or those who do not have severe disease prior to initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The Committee considered that cystic fibrosis was different from other conditions with more well-defined endpoints, and noted that objective clinical response varies somewhat for individuals with CF. Furthermore, the Committee noted that the Respiratory Advisory Committee considered that due to the mechanism of action, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA would be dictated by mutational status and therefore those patients who would not be expected to benefit would not be eligible for treatment. The Committee considered that clinicians who manage the treatment of patients with CF would act in the best interest of their patients. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee considerations that there is unlikely to be any </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vivo </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">evidence forthcoming for those with rare mutations, due to low patient numbers, and that the </span><em style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in vitro </em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">lung epithelium model used to test CF therapeutics is well validated and accepted globally. The Committee noted that the number of patients in New Zealand without known dominant mutations is small, and considered that exclusion of patients with these rarer mutations would create a small population without access to ELX/TEZ/IVA for whom evidence of benefit would not likely be generated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that ELX/TEZ/IVA should be made available for those aged six years and over. The Committee noted that younger patients who have a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) lung function testing results perceived clinically as being within normal range may still have clinically significant lung disease and airway disruption, and considered that there is no biological reason to assume that younger patients with CF would respond differently to ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the Committee also noted that these younger patients are often pre-symptomatic in terms of lung function decline, and that measuring benefit in this population would be more difficult than with older age groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee also noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that early treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA prevents development of non-pulmonary CF related illness in younger patients, but considered that there is limited evidence relating to this. The Committee also noted that there are future clinical studies planned and currently underway aiming to elucidate safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF aged as young as six months.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>Long term efficacy</em></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was likely that patients currently on ivacaftor who would be eligible for ELX/TEZ/IVA would switch if it were to become available. The Committee noted an observational US registry study of more than 16,000 patients (unpublished), which reported a substantial reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations on treatment. The Committee considered that this non-trial evidence supporting the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA to be of moderate strength given the large patient population. The Committee noted that this evidence suggested that ELX/TEZ/IVA is more effective in patients with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene than other CFTR modulators in treating CF and preventing lung function decline. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in non-trial observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations that confining measurements of health gains to only lung function testing would likely underestimate the effectiveness and impact on quality of life of ELX/TEZ/IVA. The Committee considered it reasonable and biologically plausible to infer that long term reductions in pulmonary exacerbations seen with ivacaftor in real-world observational evidence could be applied to ELX/TEZ/IVA. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee noted the Respiratory Advisory Committee\u2019s considerations regarding lung function decline and that differentiation in trajectory of disease would be somewhat dependent on baseline lung function. The Committee considered that this highlighted the benefit of treating the disease early, however re-iterated that the evidence supporting long term outcomes in patients between six and 11 years of age was particularly uncertain.</span></p>",
