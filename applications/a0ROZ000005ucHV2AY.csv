The <a class=""external-link"" href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/about/expert-advice/pharmacology-and-therapeutics-advisory-committee-ptac/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee (PTAC)</a>  meets quarterly.

<p style=""height: 20px"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2021, we introduced separate terms of reference for the SACs to make clear that these committees have different, but complementary, roles, expertise and perspectives to PTAC.</p>

<p>PTAC and SACs may make recommendations to Pharmac that differ from each other when looking at the same evidence. Pharmac considers the recommendations provided by all our clinical advisory committees when assessing applications.</p>

<p>Research and Economic analysis are undertaken.&nbsp; This focuses on the costs and benefits of a proposed course of action. Economics is based on three fundamental concepts that summarise the issues Pharmac faces daily:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The relative ranking of options aims to support Pharmac&rsquo;s statutory objective &ldquo;to secure for eligible people in need of pharmaceuticals, the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee when or if a ranked medicine will be funded.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=""external-link"" href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/prioritisation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/medicines/how-medicines-are-funded/prioritisation/</a></p>",3,Options Compared,False,,,False,False

6,"<p>We refer to our decisions about whether and how particular pharmaceuticals are publicly-funded, as &ldquo;funding decisions&rdquo;.</p>
