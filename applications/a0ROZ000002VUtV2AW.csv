The target sample size was 600, however, this was reduced to 490 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee noted that the most recently published data reported that 1/222 (0.5%) in the DTG/3TC group and 3/234 (1.3%) in the current anti-retroviral (CAR) group had HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL at week 48 (adjusted difference, −0.8%; 95% CI, −2.5% to 0.9%), demonstrating non-inferiority (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac130"" target=""_blank"">Llibre et al.

The authors reported no significant difference of adherence between the two treatment groups, as analysed using self-reported adherence questionnaires. The Committee noted two studies (Hodder S et al. AIDS Patient Care STDS; 24; 2010), (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875721/"" target=""_blank"">M. Airoldi,et al; Patient Prefer Adherence; 4; 2010</a>) which supported improved adherence and treatment satisfaction with a single pill treatment regimen but considered that the overall quality of life impact was small and there was a lack of non-adult data. Members also noted the potential for differential tablet adherence (where a patient takes only part of their daily multi-pill regimen) with multi-tablet regimens which was eliminated by a single tablet regimen.</p><p>11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence supports non-inferiority of DTG/3TC to currently funded HIV treatment regimens and therefore the single tablet of DTG/3TC would provide the same health benefit and risks as the individual funded medicines used in combination. The Committee considered that DTG/3TC would not be expected to significantly improve adherence, produce a health benefit for family, whānau or wider society, or lead to any other consequences to the health system.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Suitability</em></h3><p>12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most clinicians in New Zealand would be happy to offer treatment with DTG/3TC, if funded, and to change those eligible to this from their current treatment as it would be consistent with the HIV treatment paradigm. The Committee considered that many of those who are eligible could switch to DTG/3TC with ease, although acknowledged there may be some reluctance to switch treatment of patients who are currently stable on treatment.</p><p>13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if DTG/3TC were funded, there would not be any clinical reasons to prevent people from switching back from combination to non-combination pill regimens of dolutegravir and lamivudine in the future (eg if dolutegravir was available in a generic version). However, the Committee noted that some individuals could be inconvenienced or concerned by a change from a single tablet regimen back to a two-tablet regimen. Members were made aware of evidence of the high acceptance of such a change in the Netherlands and France where this had been discussed beforehand with people living with HIV (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27398301/"" target=""_blank"">Engelhard et al. Drugs Real World Outcomes; 2016; 2;3(2):223-230</a>) , and considered that a similar approach to implementation in New Zealand could be beneficial if such a change were necessary (eg for fiscal reasons).</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Costs and savings</em></h3><p>14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>In summary, the Committee noted the two components of DTG/3TC were already funded, acknowledged the appeal of a single pill regimen and the possible reluctance to switch treatment of individuals whose condition was stable, and considered that there was no unmet health need for this treatment. The Committee recommended DTG/3TC be funded only if cost-neutral to the weighted average of current HIV combination treatment regimens.</p><p>15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the supplier proposed that, if DTG/3TC were to be funded, clinical management would be expected to change in the following ways:</p><ul><li><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>Initiation of an INSTI-based regimen for treatment naïve patients would use DTG/3TC.</li><li>For those already on treatment, but unable to tolerate current treatment and requiring an INSTI, DTG/3TC would be considered.</li></ul><p>16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that almost all treatment-naïve patients would likely commence on a three-drug regimen (predominantly emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil and dolutegravir, FTC/TDF+DTG) and subsequently about 90% of these would be expected to switch to a two-drug regimen of DTG/3TC if treatment naïve resistance testing did not demonstrate resistance and in the absence of chronic hepatitis B infection. The Committee considered that treatment naïve patients suitable for DTG/3TC would have a viral load of &lt;500,000 copies/mL based on the concern that a high viral load may be hard to suppress with a two-drug regimen, and should not have chronic hepatitis B coinfection, as tenofovir would be required to manage this.</p><p>17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the supplier’s expectation for those already on treatment did not represent what would likely occur in the New Zealand context and considered that significant numbers would change to DTC/3TC, if funded, due to the appeal of a new, novel, single-tablet treatment. The Committee considered that the majority of those who would switch to DTG/3TC would be those individuals who are stable on a three-drug regimen, although some people would also switch due to tolerability issues on their current treatment.</p><p>18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most people would already be receiving the combination regimen and that the key differences with the proposed treatment were removing tenofovir and reducing the number of pills to be taken per day.</p><p>19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there would be very high interest and enthusiasm for a novel, single-tablet regimen such as DTG/3TC, if funded, from people living with HIV, non-government organisations and relevant clinicians. The Committee considered that 64% of existing people would be eligible to change and up to 86% of eligible people could decide to change (estimates based on the review of a clinic containing 299 adult people living with HIV). Based on these estimates, the Committee considered this would result in significant uptake of approximately 55% of the eligible group, predominantly those currently receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV, equal to approximately 1,650 people within the first two years of funding. The Committee considered that 90% of people newly diagnosed would also be initiated on DTG/3TC. The Committee therefore considered that the number of individuals who would receive DTG/3TC would be greater than those estimated by the supplier (287 in year one and 902 in year five). Members considered that it was more likely that estimates would be approximately 885 people in year one (60 who are newly diagnosed and 825 people already on treatment) and approximately 1,950 people in year five (300 who are newly diagnosed plus 1,650 people already on treatment).</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Special Authority Criteria</em></h3><p>20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable for DTG/3TC, if funded, to be subject to the current Special Authority criteria for antiretrovirals (<a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/09/01/SA2139.pdf"" target=""_blank"">SA2139</a>), requiring confirmed HIV infection for initial applications. The Committee noted that the current initial approvals appropriately allow for lifelong treatment therefore renewal would not be required and that DTG/3TC tablets would be counted as two antiretroviral therapies for the purposes of the Special Authority.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Summary for Assessment </em></h3><p>21. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for DTG/3TC if it were to be funded in New Zealand for people &gt;12 years of age with HIV-1 infection who have no known or suspected resistance to either antiretroviral component. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.

The Committee considered that 64% of existing people would be eligible to change and up to 86% of eligible people could decide to change (estimates based on the review of a clinic containing 299 adult people living with HIV). Based on these estimates, the Committee considered this would result in significant uptake of approximately 55% of the eligible group, predominantly those currently receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV, equal to approximately 1,650 people within the first two years of funding. The Committee considered that 90% of people newly diagnosed would also be initiated on DTG/3TC. The Committee therefore considered that the number of individuals who would receive DTG/3TC would be greater than those estimated by the supplier (287 in year one and 902 in year five). Members considered that it was more likely that estimates would be approximately 885 people in year one (60 who are newly diagnosed and 825 people already on treatment) and approximately 1,950 people in year five (300 who are newly diagnosed plus 1,650 people already on treatment).</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Special Authority Criteria</em></h3><p>20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable for DTG/3TC, if funded, to be subject to the current Special Authority criteria for antiretrovirals (<a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/09/01/SA2139.pdf"" target=""_blank"">SA2139</a>), requiring confirmed HIV infection for initial applications.

The Committee considered that 64% of existing people would be eligible to change and up to 86% of eligible people could decide to change (estimates based on the review of a clinic containing 299 adult people living with HIV). Based on these estimates, the Committee considered this would result in significant uptake of approximately 55% of the eligible group, predominantly those currently receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV, equal to approximately 1,650 people within the first two years of funding. The Committee considered that 90% of people newly diagnosed would also be initiated on DTG/3TC. The Committee therefore considered that the number of individuals who would receive DTG/3TC would be greater than those estimated by the supplier (287 in year one and 902 in year five). Members considered that it was more likely that estimates would be approximately 885 people in year one (60 who are newly diagnosed and 825 people already on treatment) and approximately 1,950 people in year five (300 who are newly diagnosed plus 1,650 people already on treatment).</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Special Authority Criteria</em></h3><p>20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered it reasonable for DTG/3TC, if funded, to be subject to the current Special Authority criteria for antiretrovirals (<a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2022/09/01/SA2139.pdf"" target=""_blank"">SA2139</a>), requiring confirmed HIV infection for initial applications. The Committee noted that the current initial approvals appropriately allow for lifelong treatment therefore renewal would not be required and that DTG/3TC tablets would be counted as two antiretroviral therapies for the purposes of the Special Authority.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 16px;"">Summary for Assessment </em></h3><p>21. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for DTG/3TC if it were to be funded in New Zealand for people &gt;12 years of age with HIV-1 infection who have no known or suspected resistance to either antiretroviral component. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\xa0\xa0</p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ000007QOh8&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EMOZ0000008yev"" alt=""P-001747 Table.png""></img></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a13OZ000001boDRYAY'}, 'change': None}]",Jun 2022,False,True

<li>Scarcity &ndash; resources will always be insufficient to support all possible activities.</li>
<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost &ndash; by choosing to use resources one way, we forgo other opportunities to use the same resources.</li>
