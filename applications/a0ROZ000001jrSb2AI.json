The Committee noted that many people with T2DM now have funded access to empagliflozin and GLP-1 agonists, but some individuals were not eligible for these agents because they had an HbA1c level of less than 53mmol/mol. The Committee considered that there was an unmet health need among the latter group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted HbA1c level is a marker of glycaemic control which is positively associated with the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. The Committee noted the current eligibility criteria for SGLT2-inhibitors and GLP1-agonists included an HbA1c threshold in the access criteria of 53mmol/mol. The Committee noted this 53mmol/mol threshold was recognised internationally as a target HbA1c threshold for glycaemic control used to guide treatment decisions with the intent of lowering the risk of diabetes-related complications.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the data supporting the recommended HbA1c thresholds in clinical practice were established in European populations, with uncertain applicability to M\u0101ori and Pacific individuals. The Committee also considered that, due to a lack of accessible epidemiological data on HbA1c levels in New Zealand, it was difficult to estimate how many M\u0101ori or people of Pacific ethnicity with T2DM had HbA1c levels below the threshold of 53 mmol/mol.</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><strong>Empagliflozin</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the key trials of SGLT inhibitors among individuals with T2DM such as <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1611925\" target=\"_blank\">CANVAS</a> (canagliflozin), <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32311204/\" target=\"_blank\">DEPICT-2</a> (dapagliflozin), <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1504720\" target=\"_blank\">and EMPA-REG</a> (empagliflozin) included lower-end HbA1c thresholds for inclusion of 53, 57 and 53 mmol/mol, respectively.

The Committee noted that the greatest microvascular and macrovascular risks were experienced by participants with HbA1c levels above 7% (53 mmol/mol) and this was subsequently reflected in many of the clinical guidelines on glycaemic control in diabetes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis of observational studies, which reported a non-linear relationship between HbA1c and all-cause mortality among individuals with T2DM, with the greatest increases in mortality risk observed at the most elevated HbA1c levels (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold &amp; Wang.</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\">Rev Diabet Stud.\u00a02014;11:138-152</a>). The Committee considered this meta-analysis to be suggestive of the potential survival benefits associated with additional lowering of HbA1c among individuals with HbA1c levels already below 53 mmol/mol. The Committee considered that these individuals may experience a smaller absolute magnitude of benefit compared to individuals with HbA1c levels above 53 mmol/mol.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that HbA1c was not always a comprehensive predictor of clinical endpoints. The Committee noted that in UKPDS, the differences in HbA1c levels between the two trial arms did not persist beyond a year after the trial period. However, participants in the metformin arm continued to experience a reduced risk of macrovascular events, diabetes-related complications, and all-cause mortality at 10 years follow-up compared to those in the conventional treatment arm (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18784090/\" target=\"_blank\">Holman et al. N Engl J Med. 2008;359:1577-89</a>).

The Committee noted that many people with T2DM now have funded access to empagliflozin and GLP-1 agonists, but some individuals were not eligible for these agents because they had an HbA1c level of less than 53mmol/mol. The Committee considered that there was an unmet health need among the latter group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted HbA1c level is a marker of glycaemic control which is positively associated with the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. The Committee noted the current eligibility criteria for SGLT2-inhibitors and GLP1-agonists included an HbA1c threshold in the access criteria of 53mmol/mol. The Committee noted this 53mmol/mol threshold was recognised internationally as a target HbA1c threshold for glycaemic control used to guide treatment decisions with the intent of lowering the risk of diabetes-related complications.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the data supporting the recommended HbA1c thresholds in clinical practice were established in European populations, with uncertain applicability to M\u0101ori and Pacific individuals. The Committee also considered that, due to a lack of accessible epidemiological data on HbA1c levels in New Zealand, it was difficult to estimate how many M\u0101ori or people of Pacific ethnicity with T2DM had HbA1c levels below the threshold of 53 mmol/mol.</p><h2><em>Health benefit</em></h2><p><strong>Empagliflozin</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the key trials of SGLT inhibitors among individuals with T2DM such as <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1611925\" target=\"_blank\">CANVAS</a> (canagliflozin), <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32311204/\" target=\"_blank\">DEPICT-2</a> (dapagliflozin), <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1504720\" target=\"_blank\">and EMPA-REG</a> (empagliflozin) included lower-end HbA1c thresholds for inclusion of 53, 57 and 53 mmol/mol, respectively.

The Committee noted that the greatest microvascular and macrovascular risks were experienced by participants with HbA1c levels above 7% (53 mmol/mol) and this was subsequently reflected in many of the clinical guidelines on glycaemic control in diabetes.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a meta-analysis of observational studies, which reported a non-linear relationship between HbA1c and all-cause mortality among individuals with T2DM, with the greatest increases in mortality risk observed at the most elevated HbA1c levels (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold &amp; Wang.</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310064/\" target=\"_blank\">Rev Diabet Stud.\u00a02014;11:138-152</a>). The Committee considered this meta-analysis to be suggestive of the potential survival benefits associated with additional lowering of HbA1c among individuals with HbA1c levels already below 53 mmol/mol. The Committee considered that these individuals may experience a smaller absolute magnitude of benefit compared to individuals with HbA1c levels above 53 mmol/mol.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that HbA1c was not always a comprehensive predictor of clinical endpoints. The Committee noted that in UKPDS, the differences in HbA1c levels between the two trial arms did not persist beyond a year after the trial period. However, participants in the metformin arm continued to experience a reduced risk of macrovascular events, diabetes-related complications, and all-cause mortality at 10 years follow-up compared to those in the conventional treatment arm (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18784090/\" target=\"_blank\">Holman et al. N Engl J Med. 2008;359:1577-89</a>).

The Committee considered that the available evidence suggested SGLT2 inhibitors may offer a smaller all-cause mortality benefit among individuals with T2DM and HbA1c levels of &lt;53 mmol/mol compared to individuals with higher HbA1c levels, and the strength and quality of evidence to support this benefit was substantially lower compared to the evidence for improved cardiorenal outcomes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dulaglutide</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.27.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31189511/\" target=\"_blank\">REWIND</a> (dulaglutide), <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1607141\" target=\"_blank\">SUSTAIN-6</a> (semaglutide), <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250637/\" target=\"_blank\">LEADER</a> (liraglutide), and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31186300/\" target=\"_blank\">PIONEER</a> (semaglutide) trials included individuals with HbA1c thresholds of \u226553 mmol/mol.

The Committee considered that all-cause mortality was reduced across the whole study population when using a GLP-1 agonist (HR= 0.86, 95% CI; 0.77-0.97), however the number-needed-to-treat would be &gt;300. The Committee considered there to be high-quality indirect evidence that GLP-1 agonists provide weight loss benefits for individuals with T2DM with controlled glycemia.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.30.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there is no clinical evidence indicating health benefit of GLP-1 agonists for non-diabetic individuals with high cardiorenal risk.

The Committee considered that this reflected the size of the population in New Zealand who had an unmet health need with regard to cardiovascular and renal risk and could benefit from additional lowering of HbA1c levels.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.33.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if the HbA1c threshold were to be removed, the main determinants of an individual with T2DM eligibility for empagliflozin would be their five-year cardiovascular event risk or their ethnicity. The Committee noted that in New Zealand, clinicians in primary care conduct cardiovascular event risk assessments using an algorithm derived from the PREDICT study. The Committee noted that the current algorithm does not include an HbA1c component, but new versions of the risk assessment algorithm may include such a component, and this may have some implications for the proportion of individuals with T2DM who are assessed as being at high cardiovascular risk.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.34.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, based on evidence of empagliflozin use in other settings, empagliflozin may be associated with reduced hospitalisation rates and delayed time to requiring renal replacement therapy in some individuals.</p><h2><em>Summary for assessment</em></h2><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.35.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for empagliflozin if it were to be funded in New Zealand for T2DM irrespective of glycemia.
