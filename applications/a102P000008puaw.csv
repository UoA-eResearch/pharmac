The Subcommittee noted that this application followed a supplier discontinuation of amiloride tablets, leading to fewer options for treating primary aldosteronism. The Subcommittee noted that this application was considered by the Cardiovascular Subcommittee in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-Cardiovascular-Subcommittee-Minutes-2019-05.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2019</a>, where the Cardiovascular Subcommittee recommended widening access to eplerenone for patients with primary aldosteronism who are also intolerant of spironolactone with a high priority. The Subcommittee noted that there has been no new evidence published about eplerenone for the treatment of primary aldosteronism since the Cardiovascular Subcommittee considered this application. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee also noted that the application was considered by PTAC in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">August 2019</a>, where the Committee considered that the mechanism of the health benefit for eplerenone in primary aldosteronism and resistant hypertension was likely similar to that of spironolactone, and considered that access to eplerenone for patients with primary aldosteronism who are also intolerant of spironolactone be funded with a high priority and should be further considered by the Endocrinology Subcommittee. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that primary aldosteronism is the excess production of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal glands which may be caused by hyperplasia or a tumour. The Subcommittee noted that primary aldosteronism is mainly caused by bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (also called idiopathic hyperplasia), causing 60 to 70 percent of cases, and unilateral aldosterone-producing adenomas, causing 30 to 40 percent of cases. The Subcommittee also noted that primary aldosteronism can cause fatigue, potassium deficiency (hypokalaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), poor vision, confusion, headaches, muscular aches and weakness, muscle spasms, low back and flank pain from the kidneys, trembling, tingling sensations, numbness, and excessive urination. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.5.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the current treatment for primary aldosteronism is spironolactone, which is a non-selective antagonist of the testosterone receptor that reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but can lead to potentially painful gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido. The Subcommittee also noted that spironolactone has a relatively slow onset of action, is a once daily oral treatment and is inexpensive. The Subcommittee noted that there are currently no funded alternatives to spironolactone for patients with primary aldosteronism who are intolerant to spironolactone. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that eplerenone is a selective antagonist against testosterone receptors, and also reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure with either the same or slightly less efficacy than spironolactone, and that the side effects of eplerenone seem similar to that of placebo arms in clinical trials. The Subcommittee noted that eplerenone has a quicker onset of action than spironolactone, is an oral twice daily tablet and is significantly more expensive than spironolactone. The Subcommittee noted that the dosing of eplerenone for this indication would be a maximum of 200 mg twice daily. The Subcommittee considered that eplerenone could be administered as 400 mg once a day but that twice a day would be the normal dosing regimen and would help minimise potential side effects.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the overall treatment goals for patients with primary aldosteronism is to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, hypokalaemia, renal toxicity, and cardiovascular damage, and that excessive secretion of aldosterone is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (which are independent of hypokalaemia), including an increase in left ventricular mass measurements, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The Subcommittee noted that the excess cardiovascular risk resolves after appropriate treatment of the mineralocorticoid excess. The Subcommittee noted that treatment goals for primary aldosteronism due to either unilateral or bilateral adrenal disease are the same and include reversal of the adverse cardiovascular effects of hyperaldosteronism, normalisation of the serum potassium in patients with hypokalaemia, and normalisation of blood pressure. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is not an increased prevalence of primary aldosteronism in the Māori population compared with the European population but noted that Māori do suffer from higher rates of hypertension, although the aetiology of this is unknown. The Subcommittee noted there was also an increased prevalence of hypertension in Pacific populations. The Subcommittee considered that there is strong evidence to support the health benefit of lowering blood pressure with eplerenone in this patient population. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that that quality-of-life gains if eplerenone were to be funded for the treatment of primary aldosteronism would not differ between patients with primary aldosteronism and those with resistant hypertension and would include a reduction in unpleasant side-effects from spironolactone, and an effective reduction blood-pressure. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of eligible patients estimated by the Cardiovascular Subcommittee (under 100 new patients each year) to be an underestimate but noted that there is considerable uncertainty in patient numbers. The Subcommittee considered that prevalent patient numbers are more likely to fall in the upper end of the numbers forecast by the applicant (ie in the 1000s). However, the Subcommittee considered the highest approximation of 5000 to be an overestimation. The Subcommittee noted the applicant’s forecast of patient numbers was based on a prevalence of hypertension of 31% of adults, a prevalence of primary aldosteronism of 2% of patients with hypertension of which about 50% would be medically treated, and reports of spironolactone intolerance ranging from 8% to 54%.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is a prevalent pool of patients who would be eligible for eplerenone but considered that there is significant uncertainty as to how many patients this would be. The Subcommittee noted that this would include a cohort of men with primary aldosteronism who are currently taking spironolactone and living with the adverse events, as well as most patients who have stopped taking spironolactone due to intolerance and adverse events.\xa0The Subcommittee noted that the eligible population would be significantly larger if patients with resistant hypertension were also considered.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if eplerenone were to be funded there would be no significant changes to long-term expenditure for the health system, other than direct treatment costs. The Subcommittee considered eplerenone may reduce the frequency with which patients see a specialist, estimating this would change from every 6 weeks to every 3 months. The Subcommittee noted that eplerenone is likely non-inferior to spironolactone in preventing secondary endpoints of primary aldosteronism such as high blood pressure but considered that the eplerenone would provide long-term benefits in prevention of spironolactone related adverse-events and by making available a treatment option to patients intolerant to spironolactone.\xa0</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000D5bTQAS'}, 'change': None}]",May 2019,False,True
