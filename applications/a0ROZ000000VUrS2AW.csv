The Subcommittee considered that patients with amyloidosis have high health need due to this severe, chronic disease which causes poor health and results in an expected survival of between three and five years from diagnosis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein causes the rare condition of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) which can be due to either mutated ATTR (ATTRm) or wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt).

The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand, patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis are commonly diagnosed once they reach a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of III or above because specific investigations commence upon symptomatic presentation.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there may be about 50 to 100 patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis in NZ with a further 10 patients diagnosed per year.

It was considered that patient numbers may increase over time with an aging population. The Subcommittee considered that this disease would currently meet the PHARMAC Rare Disorders criteria. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that current treatment is unable to modify the disease course and that no curative treatment is available.
