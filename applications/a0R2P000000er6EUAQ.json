At this time, the Subcommittee recommended that a half-dose preparation of macrogol 3350 or a preparation more palatable for children be funded, noting that the palatability issue for children with this product is more related to the electrolyte components rather than the flavouring. The Committee noted that this application was also reviewed and recommended for funding with no priority at the following clinical advice meetings: <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2012-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC Aug 2012</a>, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2014-05-21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gastrointestinal Subcommittee May 2014</a>, and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2014-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC Nov 2014</a>.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2017-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gastrointestinal Subcommittee March 2017</a> meeting macrogol (electrolyte-free or flavourless) was recommended for funding with a high priority. It was noted that, at this time, the Subcommittee considered that it was important for children, particularly those with developmental disorders and the very young, to have access to a tasteless formulation such as the electrolyte-free macrogol 3350. The Subcommittee members considered that the taste of the macrogol 3350 to be a barrier to use in those children, as even mixing it with juice did not disguise the taste. The Subcommittee also considered that it would be appropriate to require children to trial the standard macrogol 3350 before being eligible for the electrolyte-free formulation.

The Committee noted that estimates of the true prevalence of constipation vary between 1-30%, even when uniform criteria are used, with the peak prevalence being during the pre-school years in most reports (<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Abstract/2006/10000/Epidemiology_of_Childhood_Constipation__A.32.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">van den Berg et al.

The Committee considered that osmotic laxatives should be used as first-line therapy for constipation before introducing a stimulant laxative such as sodium picosulfate. The Committee considered macrogol to be the most effective osmotic laxative available in the paediatric setting, and that it was reasonable that children first trial macrogol with electrolytes. The Committee considered that current treatment is likely to include lactulose.</span></p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee noted that electrolyte-free or flavourless macrogol provides a suitability benefit over macrogol with electrolytes due to its improved palatability for children, thereby improving adherence to treatment. The Committee noted comments from the Gastrointestinal Subcommittee in the 2017 meeting that it was important for children, particularly those with developmental disorders and the very young, to have access to a tasteless formulation such as the electrolyte-free macrogol 3350. The Committee noted that the taste of the macrogol 3350 with electrolytes may affect uptake in children as even mixing it with juice did not disguise the taste.</span></p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that, if macrogol were to be funded, there are likely to be cost offsets to the health sector from successful treatment of constipation and avoidance of stimulant laxatives, including reduced GP and hospital outpatient visits.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Committee noted that </span>it is assumed that 30% of children would switch from macrogol 3350 with potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium chloride to electrolyte-free macrogol; and 15% would switch from lactulose. The Committee noted that the proportion of those affected unable to tolerate regular macrogol is 15-30%, based on expert advice obtained in May 2018, and that uptake would be 50% in year 1, increasing to 100% in year 5.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><em>Funding Criteria</em></h3><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that in the 2017 Gastrointestinal Subcommittee clinical advice meeting, it was considered that it would be appropriate to require children to trial macrogol 3350 with electrolytes before being eligible to receive funding for the electrolyte-free formulation.

At this time, the Subcommittee recommended that a half-dose preparation of macrogol 3350 or a preparation more palatable for children be funded, noting that the palatability issue for children with this product is more related to the electrolyte components rather than the flavouring. The Committee noted that this application was also reviewed and recommended for funding with no priority at the following clinical advice meetings: <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2012-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC Aug 2012</a>, <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2014-05-21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gastrointestinal Subcommittee May 2014</a>, and <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2014-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC Nov 2014</a>.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at the <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-gastrointestinal-subcommittee-minutes-2017-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gastrointestinal Subcommittee March 2017</a> meeting macrogol (electrolyte-free or flavourless) was recommended for funding with a high priority. It was noted that, at this time, the Subcommittee considered that it was important for children, particularly those with developmental disorders and the very young, to have access to a tasteless formulation such as the electrolyte-free macrogol 3350. The Subcommittee members considered that the taste of the macrogol 3350 to be a barrier to use in those children, as even mixing it with juice did not disguise the taste. The Subcommittee also considered that it would be appropriate to require children to trial the standard macrogol 3350 before being eligible for the electrolyte-free formulation.

The Committee considered macrogol to be the most effective osmotic laxative available in the paediatric setting, and that it was reasonable that children first trial macrogol with electrolytes.
