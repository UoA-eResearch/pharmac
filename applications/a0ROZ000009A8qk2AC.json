The Committee considered that many of the toxicities experienced on first-line sunitinib were relatively straightforward to treat, and that it was uncommon for these adverse events to require hospitalisation. The Committee further considered that the adverse events experienced on first-line sunitinib often resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The Committee considered that the immune-related adverse events experienced with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab can be complex and may require treatment even after treatment discontinuation.</p><p>1.30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30658932/\" target=\"_blank\">Cella et al.
