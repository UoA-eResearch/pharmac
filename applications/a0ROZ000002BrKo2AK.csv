The Committee noted that these trials did not include\xa0control groups and were of low to moderate quality regarding adverse effects (rated\xa0according to the GRADE approach), however, the Committee considered that this\xa0evidence showed that fomepizole was effective in normalising acid-base status.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that it was unclear whether the adverse events (AEs)\xa0reported in each of the two studies (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10080845"" target=""_blank"">Brent et al.

The Committee noted the authors reported cardiovascular AEs in\xa0patients who received fomepizole and considered that these were concerning for\xa0patients with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning who have considerable morbidity.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a retrospective observational case series assessing\xa0risk factors related to poor outcome in 203 patients with methanol poisoning (of which\xa032 received fomepizole) reported by <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22992104"" target=""_blank"">Paasma et al. (Clin Toxicol (Philia). 2012;50:823-31</a>). The Committee considered the results showed that low pH, coma and inadequate\xa0hyperventilation on admission were strong predictors of poor outcome. The Committee\xa0also noted that the authors suggest ethanol and fomepizole are equally effective\xa0treatments, but the practical disadvantages of ethanol can affect its efficacy.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a retrospective study of 172 patients hospitalised\xa0between 1996 and 2005 for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18639955"" target=""_blank"">Lepik et al.

The Committee noted that the authors report more AEs\xa0occurred in patients who received ethanol (57%) than in patients who received\xa0fomepizole (12%), and that there were more severe or life-threatening AEs in patients\xa0receiving ethanol (20% and 8% respectively) than with fomepizole (5% and 2%\xa0respectively).\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of fomepizole in\xa0healthy volunteers which were reported by <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554311"" target=""_blank"">McMartin et al. Clin Toxicol (Philia).\xa02012;50:375-83</a>) in which the authors suggest, based on their results, that patients\xa0require an increased dose of fomepizole after 36 hours.

Toxicol Sci. 2005;85:491-501</a>). The Committee\xa0considered that the authors reported that the effect of fomepizole on alcohol\xa0dehydrogenase was not clearly correlated with outcome, although theoretically it should\xa0be.</p><p>\xa0\xa0</p><p>The Committee noted the AE data provided from two randomised, unblinded studies of\xa0fomepizole in healthy volunteers (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3056073"" target=""_blank"">Jacobsen et al. Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1988;12:516-22</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2212566"" target=""_blank"">Jacobsen et al. J Emerg Med. 1990;8:455-61</a>). The Committee noted the authors\xa0reported gastrointestinal, CNS, cardiovascular and metabolic AEs with fomepizole.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted the results of a case series of 38 patients with ethylene glycol\xa0poisoning reported by <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10485727"" target=""_blank"">Borron et al. (Lancet. 1999;354:831</a>), which suggest that\xa0fomepizole is effective and safe treatment, especially if administered early, and that\xa0fomepizole alone is sufficient therapy for patients with normal renal function and normal\xa0acid-base status.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee also noted the evidence provided in the application to list fomepizole on\xa0the <a href=""https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/"" target=""_blank"">WHO Model List of Essential Medicines</a> and considered that this provided\xa0reasonable evidence for fomepizole in this indication.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that evidence indicated that fomepizole had a different but\xa0not necessarily better AE profile compared to ethanol. The Committee considered that\xa0while there were fewer toxicities reported with use of fomepizole, significant AEs\xa0(including cardiovascular AEs) were reported in patients receiving fomepizole.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the evidence for fomepizole was of poor quality and\xa0strength which made it difficult to draw conclusions about the benefit of fomepizole\xa0compared to ethanol. The Committee considered that the retrospective nature of the\xa0data provided some long-term data on outcomes and limited reporting of AEs, although\xa0members were uncertain of the accuracy of comparing AE data across studies.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered it unlikely that there will be high-quality evidence from\xa0randomised controlled trials of ethanol compared to fomepizole in patients with ethylene\xa0glycol or methanol poisoning in future, due to the challenges in research in patients with\xa0this poisoning, since fomepizole appears to have been used preferentially for very unwell\xa0patients in some trials, and because it has already been adopted globally.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that fomepizole had similar efficacy to ethanol and that it was\xa0likely that fomepizole would benefit patients who present with severe poisoning. The\xa0Committee considered that the evidence suggests fomepizole may reduce health\xa0resource use in patients with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, however, it is\xa0unclear whether fomepizole would reduce the costs of managing these patients.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that health resource costs are influenced by whether patients with\xa0ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning require care in an ICU or a high-dependency unit\xa0(HDU), and whether intubation or haemodialysis is required.\xa0\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that specialist advice should be sought from groups such as\xa0intensive care unit physicians, emergency department physicians, toxicologists and\xa0professional bodies (such as the Australasian Society of Clinical and Experimental\xa0Pharmacologists and Toxicologists (ASCEPT)) regarding the number of patients\xa0presenting with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, and whether the availability of\xa0fomepizole would alter patient management or reduce the use of health sector resource\xa0as compared to ethanol in New Zealand. The Committee considered that the priority of\xa0its recommendation for fomepizole should be reconsidered in light of the above\xa0information if its use would not reduce health sector costs.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the reduced monitoring requirements with administration of\xa0fomepizole (compared to ethanol which requires regular frequent measurements of\xa0metabolic status and ethanol concentration) could mean a preference for its use as a\xa0first-line treatment in all patients. Members considered that clinicians may look to initiate\xa0treatment with fomepizole on suspicion of poisoning, rather than delaying treatment until\xa0diagnosis is confirmed. Members noted that the proposed restriction criteria was\xa0generally in line with the TOXINZ indications for treatment with ethanol or fomepizole.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that the dose regimen of fomepizole, including an increased\xa0dose after 36 hours, should be a consideration for cost sensitivity analysis.\xa0</p>', 'fs': '<p>The Committee noted that poisoning from ethylene glycol or methanol results from\xa0deliberate or accidental ingestion of products containing these agents (such as\xa0antifreeze or windscreen fluid) or where they are used as an ethanol substitute (such as\xa0moonshine).

The Committee noted that patients receiving ethanol alone had a more acidotic pH than those who received fomepizole (6.96 vs 7.20, respectively), that there was a longer time to presentation in those treated with ethanol alone than with fomepizole (six vs three hours), and that the time from presentation to receiving antidote was longer with ethanol alone than with fomepizole (ten vs three and a half hours).

However, the Committee considered that higher quality evidence would not be expected to eventuate and considered that the available evidence supported use of fomepizole with reported efficacy at least equivalent to that of ethanol. The Committee noted that there is no evidence that fomepizole would reduce patient time in intensive care units (ICU) or reduce the need for dialysis. The Committee considered that the ease of fomepizole administration and its reduced adverse event profile compared to ethanol were the most relevant outcomes for Pharmac assessment.
