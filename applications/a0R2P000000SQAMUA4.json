The Committee recommended that PHARMAC staff conduct analysis to determine what the financial impact would be of amending the stopping criteria to 4.5, 5.5 and 6.0 for all patients and bring this back to the Committee for its view. The Committee considered that the financial impact of widening access, and its view of this, could then be provided to both the Neurological Subcommittee and MSTAC for their views.",

J Neurol Neurosurg Psych. 2014;85:1190-7</a>). The Committee noted that this was a 5-year interim analysis, where 4821 patients were originally enrolled, and that follow-up was for at least 4 years from natalizumab commencement in 468 patients and at least 2 years in 2496 patients. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean annualised relapse rate decreasing from 1.99 in the 12 months prior to baseline to 0.31 on natalizumab therapy (p&lt;0.0001) and remaining low after 5 years. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean EDSS scores remaining unchanged up to 5 years for those who were still in the study at follow-up. However, the Committee considered that the study had significant limitations due to the low proportion of participants that completed the follow-up, and that the results were likely representative of only the subset those that did well/responded to treatment with natalizumab. </p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In addition the Committee considered two publications (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771747\" target=\"_blank\">Wiendl et al. PLoS One. 2016;11:1-14</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860197\" target=\"_blank\">Trojano et al. Mult Scler Relat Disord. 2018;24:11-19</a>) presenting further analyses from the Butzkueven et al observational study (paragraph 14.9).

The Committee noted that this was because PHARMAC staff considered that the analysis for EDSS 0 \u2013 5.5 was unlikely to significantly differ from EDSS 0 \u2013 6.0, because of the small increment of score change involving a few patients between EDSS 5.5 and 6.0, and that transition probabilities for half states of disease have not been previously reviewed by PTAC.</p><p>3.8.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that as each of the MS treatments have different net prices and different proportionate market shares, and that for this reason PHARMAC staff had used an average drug price to estimate the budget impact of amending the entry and stopping criteria.</p><p>3.8.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff estimated the additional cost to the combined pharmaceutical budget of expanding access to EDSS 4.5 would be <b>[Withheld].</b></p><p>3.8.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff estimated the additional cost to the combined pharmaceutical budget of expanding access to EDSS 6.0 would be <b>[Withheld].</b></p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that when it had first reviewed funding applications for the new Multiple Sclerosis treatments they were very expensive treatments, but that over time the prices for some of these had significantly decreased, due to various PHARMAC commercial arrangements.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered cost effectiveness analysis conducted by PHARMAC staff.</p><p>3.10.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff had estimated the cost effectiveness of expanding access to all MS treatments gaining between <b>[Withheld]</b> per $1 million (widening access up to EDSS 6.0).</p><p>3.10.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that these estimates (paragraph 14.13.1) assumed that the treatments would continue to provide a similar health benefit (in terms of relative risks of disease progression) at higher EDSS states as occurs in lower EDSS states, as modelled previously.

J Neurol Neurosurg Psych. 2014;85:1190-7</a>). The Committee noted that this was a 5-year interim analysis, where 4821 patients were originally enrolled, and that follow-up was for at least 4 years from natalizumab commencement in 468 patients and at least 2 years in 2496 patients. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean annualised relapse rate decreasing from 1.99 in the 12 months prior to baseline to 0.31 on natalizumab therapy (p&lt;0.0001) and remaining low after 5 years. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean EDSS scores remaining unchanged up to 5 years for those who were still in the study at follow-up. However, the Committee considered that the study had significant limitations due to the low proportion of participants that completed the follow-up, and that the results were likely representative of only the subset those that did well/responded to treatment with natalizumab. </p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In addition the Committee considered two publications (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771747\" target=\"_blank\">Wiendl et al.

The Committee noted that this was a 5-year interim analysis, where 4821 patients were originally enrolled, and that follow-up was for at least 4 years from natalizumab commencement in 468 patients and at least 2 years in 2496 patients. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean annualised relapse rate decreasing from 1.99 in the 12 months prior to baseline to 0.31 on natalizumab therapy (p&lt;0.0001) and remaining low after 5 years. The Committee noted that the authors reported the mean EDSS scores remaining unchanged up to 5 years for those who were still in the study at follow-up. However, the Committee considered that the study had significant limitations due to the low proportion of participants that completed the follow-up, and that the results were likely representative of only the subset those that did well/responded to treatment with natalizumab. </p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>In addition the Committee considered two publications (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771747\" target=\"_blank\">Wiendl et al. PLoS One. 2016;11:1-14</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860197\" target=\"_blank\">Trojano et al. Mult Scler Relat Disord. 2018;24:11-19</a>) presenting further analyses from the Butzkueven et al observational study (paragraph 14.9). The Committee considered that the limitations of these studies were the same as the parent study: again, that the results were likely representative of only the subset of those that do well/respond to treatment with natalizumab.</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered budget impact analysis conducted by PHARMAC staff. </p><p>3.8.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff had undertaken budget impact analysis for EDSS 0-4.5 and EDSS 0-6.0 only. The Committee noted that this was because PHARMAC staff considered that the analysis for EDSS 0 \u2013 5.5 was unlikely to significantly differ from EDSS 0 \u2013 6.0, because of the small increment of score change involving a few patients between EDSS 5.5 and 6.0, and that transition probabilities for half states of disease have not been previously reviewed by PTAC.</p><p>3.8.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that as each of the MS treatments have different net prices and different proportionate market shares, and that for this reason PHARMAC staff had used an average drug price to estimate the budget impact of amending the entry and stopping criteria.</p><p>3.8.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff estimated the additional cost to the combined pharmaceutical budget of expanding access to EDSS 4.5 would be <b>[Withheld].</b></p><p>3.8.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff estimated the additional cost to the combined pharmaceutical budget of expanding access to EDSS 6.0 would be <b>[Withheld].</b></p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that when it had first reviewed funding applications for the new Multiple Sclerosis treatments they were very expensive treatments, but that over time the prices for some of these had significantly decreased, due to various PHARMAC commercial arrangements.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered cost effectiveness analysis conducted by PHARMAC staff.</p><p>3.10.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PHARMAC staff had estimated the cost effectiveness of expanding access to all MS treatments gaining between <b>[Withheld]</b> per $1 million (widening access up to EDSS 6.0).</p><p>3.10.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that these estimates (paragraph 14.13.1) assumed that the treatments would continue to provide a similar health benefit (in terms of relative risks of disease progression) at higher EDSS states as occurs in lower EDSS states, as modelled previously. The Committee noted that the economic modelling also assumed that the treatment effect on disease progression would remain the same irrespective of how many lines of treatment a patient had trialled. The Committee considered however that it was more likely that effects on disease progression diminish with each line of treatment. </p><p>3.10.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that drug costs, relative risks of disease progression and administration costs were the average of the following treatments: natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, and ocrelizumab.</p><p>3.10.4<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that economic modelling for MS treatments was highly complex, because of the multiple disease states that patients progress through and the associated with the variable time course of progression of individual patients with MS. </p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>\u00a0The Committee considered that it had not seen robust evidence demonstrating MS treatments having similar efficacy at higher EDSS states (up to 6.0); however in the absence of evidence, and due to the complexity of modelling the disease, it accepted the simplified approach of modelling similar heath gains at EDSS states of 4.5-6.0, with the caution this may overestimate the true QALY gains. In addition, the Committee considered the QALY gains would likely be further overestimated due to the assumption that the treatment effects on disease progression would remain the same irrespective of the lines of treatment that had been trialled; however the Committee acknowledged the complexities of modelling more than two lines of treatment, and accepted this simplified approach too.</p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that if a patient was unable to walk 100 meters without aid that would mean an EDSS score of 6.0; and, considered that this was a simple, practical and replicable threshold with which to align stopping criteria.</p>",
