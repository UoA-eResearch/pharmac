The Committee considered there was some uncertainty in whether there would be non-inferiority in a clinical context, although noted the non-inferiority reported according to the FeDeriCa definitions and endpoints.

The Committee considered there was some uncertainty in whether there would be non-inferiority in a clinical context, although noted the non-inferiority reported according to the FeDeriCa definitions and endpoints.

The Committee considered that there would be a resource impact even if SC treatment were able to be given in the community, likely conveying an opportunity cost on general practice. The Committee noted that it was not a safety issue preventing primary care administration of infusions, rather increased capacity would be required as the same infusion services would deliver either SC or IV treatment.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.17.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there was the potential for a proactive community treatment plan in future in collaboration with Te Whatu Ora, linking to the overall health strategy and including provincial centres for access to a range of treatments (eg inflammatory diseases). Members considered that such a transition to primary care (not necessarily general practice) would offer benefits by enabling access for those living in remote or rural areas, although acknowledged these may not be quantifiable time savings for Pharmac cost-effectiveness assessment.</p><h2><strong>Costs and Savings</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.18.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC for mBC, even if cost-neutral, may incur a cost to the healthcare system and a cost to individuals in the community for treatment administration. The Committee noted the competition for supply of IV trastuzumab (with a competitive process currently underway), and therefore considered it was reasonable, at this point in time, to require cost neutrality to the originator pertuzumab and generic trastuzumab. The Committee considered competition for pertuzumab would also be anticipated following patent expiry for this agent, although the Committee noted there were still active patents in New Zealand for the innovator IV pertuzumab. The Committee noted that this proposal would be the originator combination product.</p><h2><strong>Summary for Assessment</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.19.</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt; color: black;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for pertuzumab-trastuzumab SC at this time, for neoadjuvant treatment of HER-2 positive early breast cancer. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The Committee noted that elements of the PICO for this application are unclear/uncertain at this time.
