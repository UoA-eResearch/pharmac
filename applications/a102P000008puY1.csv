The Subcommittee noted that these criteria are based on, but not identical to, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC/Motzer) score for clear cell RCC. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 35% of newly diagnosed RCC patients are expected to have a good prognosis. The Subcommittee noted that current Special Authority criteria for sunitinib and pazopanib requires patients to have at least two sites of distance metastases and considered that this should be removed from the criteria regardless of access widening as this limits access to some intermediate and poor prognosis patients and is not a part of the MSKCC scoring system, nor the more widely used IMDC (International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium) score used to assess prognostic group. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.3.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that sunitinib had been previously considered by CaTSoP for the treatment of good prognosis RCC patients in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-catsop-subcommittee-minutes-2010-11.pdf"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 12pt;""><b>November 2010</b></a> \xa0at which time the Subcommittee considered that sunitinib should be funded for all patients with metastatic RCC, but due to its high cost the Subcommittee recommended sunitinib be declined for funding for good prognosis patients.

Pazopanib was funded for intermediate and poor prognosis patients in 2012. The Subcommittee noted that sunitinib and pazopanib are currently only funded for first-line treatment of intermediate to poor prognosis RCC, and patients are only permitted to switch between the two medicines if they experience intolerable side effects on one or the other within three months of commencement of either therapy. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.4.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that ESMO and NCCN guidelines recommend sunitinib and pazopanib for use in good, intermediate, and poor prognosis patients only as alternatives following failure of preferred first line treatments.

The Subcommittee noted that more data was unlikely to be published, as treatment paradigms internationally have shifted from use of these agents in the first line. The Subcommittee noted that evidence for benefit for pazopanib in the treatment of RCC patients with a good prognosis is not as strong as that for sunitinib but considered that it was an appropriate alternative to sunitinib. The Subcommittee considered that although sunitinib and pazopanib are both TKIs, they have different side-effect profiles, and considered that it was important that both remain funded, rather than being considered as two equivalent drugs from the same class. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted an international multicentre randomised open label phase III trial (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19487381/"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 12pt;""><b>Motzer et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival probability was not statistically significant between the two treatment groups (HR = 0.821, 95% CI 0.673 to 1.001, p = 0.051); however, subgroup analysis showed that patients who did not go on to receive treatment following the trial had a median overall survival with sunitinib twice that of the interferon alpha treatment group (28.1 vs 14.1 months respectively, HR = 0.647, 95% CI 0.483 to 0.870, P=0.003).

The Subcommittee noted that in time, these patients would eventually fulfil the current Special Authority criteria, meaning that they would likely experience symptoms as they progress. The Subcommittee considered that treatment prior to disease progression (ie. treatment of good prognosis patients) would be beneficial for some patients as it would lessen the risk of potentially dangerous outcomes, as disease progression could occur in critical areas such as in bone or spinal cord.\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that if sunitinib and pazopanib were to be funded for all RCC patients regardless of prognosis, there would be a slight increase on health system burden through an increase in appointments, requirements for blood testing, and to a lesser degree increased need for imaging facilities and treatments to manage treatment related toxicities such as thyroid issues and diarrhoea. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the median number of treatment cycles of sunitinib that patients received in the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19487381/"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 12pt;""><b>Motzer at al</b></a> trial was 7.9; however, the Subcommittee noted that this number would differ depending on prognosis.
