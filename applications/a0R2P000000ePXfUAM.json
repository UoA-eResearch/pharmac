PTAC had considered that there was evidence to support higher doses in some patients determined by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). There was also evidence that some patients may be under-dosed with current restrictions. PTAC had requested PHARMAC staff provide a paper on TDM of biologics for gastrointestinal conditions, and PTAC had highlighted specific concerns regarding uncertainty of benefits and uncertainty of the extent to which the approach would change usage, due to low quality evidence.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that both adalimumab and infliximab are anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibodies, also called biologic treatments, and that both are Medsafe-approved for use as induction and maintenance treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and adalimumab is funded for the treatment of CD. The Committee noted that there is increased competition in this market with the introduction of biosimilars, and new monoclonal antibodies with different molecular targets, and that commercial processes may provide opportunities for widening access for these agents.</p><p>3.5.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that adalimumab is funded for use in adults and children with CD and in patients with fistulising CD, with an initial 3 to 6 month induction period that has no dosing restriction, however, the renewal criteria include a maximum dose of no greater than 40 mg every 14 days.</p><p>3.5.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for use in adults and children with CD, patients with fistulising CD, patients with severe fulminant UC and patients with severe UC, to be administered at doses up to 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee noted that infliximab doses of up to 10 mg per kg every 8 weeks (or equivalent) \u2013 treatment re-induction \u2013 can be used for up to 3 doses if required for secondary non-response, and that another re-induction may be considered 16 weeks after completing the last re-induction cycle.</p><p>3.5.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC has previously considered, and PHARMAC has ranked, funding applications for weekly dosing of adalimumab for CD (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000Lmll/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for CD, rescue therapy</a>, on the Application Tracker), and for adalimumab for the treatment of UC (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000M59B/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, first-line</a> and <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000LmUg/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, second-line</a>, on the Application Tracker).</p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that primary loss of response, so-called primary non-response (PNR), occurs in about 10-30% of patients with IBD, where patients do not respond to induction treatment with biologics. Secondary loss of response (LOR) occurs in patients who respond to induction therapy but lose this response during maintenance treatment. Secondary LOR is potentially due to anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), immune mechanisms, and/or inadequate drug concentrations.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ADAs may be neutralising, modifying the drug binding site and directly affecting therapeutic response; or non-neutralising, increasing drug clearance through the immune system and thereby leading to reduced therapeutic effect. The Committee noted that a New Zealand study of 103 patients (84 with CD, 17 with UC and 2 with unclassified IBD) who received either adalimumab or infliximab reported that neutralising and non-neutralising ADAs were more common in patients with trough drug concentrations less than 2 mg/L (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30091273\" target=\"_blank\">Barclay et al. Intern Med J. 2019:49;513-18</a>).</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that monitoring disease states is challenging in IBD. Trial-based indices are not used routinely in clinical practice because of concerns about their utility outside randomised controlled trials. Disease assessment for IBD in clinical practice may use any, or all, of: the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), endoscopy, testing for C-reactive protein (CRP), and faecal calprotectin.</p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with IBD who receive anti-TNF treatment may have a health need due to primary or secondary loss of response to this treatment, as described. Members considered that patients with IBD for whom anti-TNF treatment is not effective may opt to try another biologic agent with a different mechanism of action, although these are not currently funded. Otherwise surgery could be considered. Members considered that optimising anti-TNF treatment may be better than changing treatment or considering surgery for such patients.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence that some patients in New Zealand with IBD already receive higher doses of infliximab than the maintenance dosing of 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee considered that use of higher doses may be due to clinician preference, interpretation of the infliximab funding restrictions on the hospital medicines list (introduction and re-introduction), and the practicalities of episodic use in clinics where the remainder of a vial is given to a patient instead of being discarded. Members noted that, until recently, PHARMAC did not have patient level data for infliximab use in DHB hospitals.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that target concentrations for anti-TNF agents may depend on disease severity, but that the optimal target drug concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab were unclear. Members considered that recommended target concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab in the treatment of IBD have increased with time. However, the Committee considered that there was limited supporting evidence for particular target concentrations.</p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a treatment strategy that uses a target drug concentration rather than a target dose. Members noted that TDM may use a variety of dosing strategies including, but not limited to: stepwise dosing, proportional dosing, or model-based dosing. Members considered that it is unclear whether disease symptoms should mediate decisions on drug dosing, or whether use of TDM is a superior strategy in IBD. The Committee noted that TDM is already used around New Zealand for the management of patients who receive adalimumab or infliximab for the treatment of IBD. However, Members noted that uptake of TDM for IBD is not consistent around New Zealand, although has likely increased following the recent publication of New Zealand guidelines (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845128\" target=\"_blank\">Khan et al. N Z Med J. 2019:132;46-62</a>).</p><p>3.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that TDM strategies may use sequential measurements for dose determination including drug concentration measurement. This can involve eg. dose alteration and concentration re-measurement until therapeutic dose achieved; peak and trough concentration measurement to determine clearance; and then dose determination using other clinical measurements. The Committee noted that dose modelling may be influenced by variables that affect drug concentration. This can include drug clearance, protein breakdown, binding targets, ADAs, disease severity, comorbidities eg. obesity, or other drugs such as methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids.</p><p>3.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that assessment of response in TDM includes some measurements of disease activity that may not be sensitive or specific, eg. CRP, and also technical issues of assay, such as measurement of bound and unbound drug, to best manage this condition. Members considered that, ideally, TDM would use an optimal modelling strategy to measure and promptly reach an optimal target concentration for any given patient with IBD.</p><p>3.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered whether the maximum funded doses of adalimumab and infliximab should be increased for the treatment of patients with IBD who are not responding to their current treatment, for either or both of PNR or LOR. The Committee considered that the question of whether a TDM strategy or another mechanism is required to clinically support the rationale for dose escalation and de-escalation was a secondary consideration that did not necessarily need to be determined in the funding criteria for these agents.</p><p>3.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from a double-blind, controlled trial of infliximab maintenance for 54 weeks in 122 biologic-na\u00efve adult patients with active CD who were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either: up to 2 dose increases with steps of 2.5 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms, biomarker analysis and/or serum infliximab concentrations (dose intensification strategy 1, DIS1); a dose increase from 5 to 10 mg/kg based on the same criteria (DIS2); or a dose increase to 10 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms alone (controls) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317275\" target=\"_blank\">D\u2019Haens et al.

N Z Med J. 2019:132;46-62</a>). The Committee noted that this guideline suggests TDM in IBD may be cost-saving, may result in fewer disease-related complications, and may reduce the need for surgery. The Committee considered that the guideline is limited by the use of a subjective scoring system, and that the evidence for benefit is largely based on studies reporting retrospective cohort studies. Members noted the limitations with this level of evidence that can bias estimates of efficacy. The Committee also noted that the recommended approach does not cover use of higher drug concentrations, criteria for dose de-escalation, or criteria for treatment cessation. Without the latter, patients could potentially continue on treatment even if it was not providing a benefit.</p><p>3.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that TDM with adalimumab and infliximab for IBD is performed internationally and that this is supported by consensus statements.

There is also evidence that there is a positive association between treatment outcomes and drug concentrations. However, the extent of the influence of other important clinical characteristics on these relationships is difficult to quantify. The Committee considered that use of higher doses than currently funded to reach higher concentrations of adalimumab and infliximab for IBD were supported by the evidence reviewed. The Committee also noted that there were no head-to-head trials that compared adalimumab to infliximab for the treatment of IBD, and that comparison of the benefits of these two pharmaceuticals is therefore unclear.</p><p>3.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence base for benefits from TDM in IBD was weak. The Committee considered that TDM was a tool that could offer benefits such as identifying patients who require a higher dose and may help to determine if low drug concentrations are due to ADAs compared to disease severity. The Committee considered that the TDM strategy for IBD proposed by the applicant and in the evidence reviewed fell short of the detailed modelling seen in other TDM strategies. The Committee considered that this TDM approach does not specify appropriate higher doses, facilitate decision-making for treatment cessation, or guide a patient\u2019s duration on treatment. Members considered that the proposed TDM strategy could result in unnecessary dose increases for patients with good disease control, if their drug concentrations fell below the TDM-specified threshold.</p><p>3.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that identification of patients who could benefit from higher therapeutic doses could also be done through assessment of response. The Committee also noted that a change in target concentration is known to be required for some patient subgroups eg. intraluminal CD or severe CD phenotypes, where increased drug concentrations are required.</p><p>3.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that there is unlikely to be an increase in adverse events associated with the use of higher therapeutic doses of adalimumab or infliximab, with or without TDM, due to the target therapeutic dose. Members considered that a reduction in inflammation would benefit patients with IBD by reducing their risk of developing cancer.</p><p>3.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the effect of increased dosing or treatment cessation based on TDM on cost-effectiveness analyses was unclear. This is because there is insufficient evidence to estimate the extent of the incremental benefits. The Committee noted that drug costs would be higher due to increased doses. Members considered that the costs of increased treatment doses may be balanced by reduction in hospital admissions, dose de-escalations and surgeries, however, long-term study data would be needed to better estimate changes to these resource costs. Members considered that cost-savings could result from a reduction in surgery if there was a substantial increase in remission rates, and from treatment cessation in patients who were not receiving a benefit from adalimumab or infliximab. The Committee considered that it was unclear whether patients who previously used and discontinued biologic treatment for IBD would receive this treatment again.</p><p>3.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that resource requirements for clinic assessments, laboratory tests, patient monitoring and physician training would be the same as those currently required, because TDM is currently used for management of IBD in NZ. The Committee noted that drug concentration and ADA tests are performed only in Christchurch with a reasonable turnaround time of 4 weeks, however, it was unclear which drug form(s) are measured eg. unbound, bound and/or total. Members considered that it was uncertain whether one laboratory could sufficiently perform testing for all NZ IBD patients if required. However, it seemed likely that turnaround times would be appropriate for long-term monitoring for disease management. Members considered that close monitoring may provide a benefit with regard to patient adherence with treatment, and that TDM could help rationalise the use of other pharmaceuticals.</p><p>3.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the current evidence for the proposed use of TDM and measurement of ADAs to adjust dosing of adalimumab and infliximab in IBD was insufficient to inform a recommendation. The Committee noted that PHARMAC\u2019s role is not to specify management but to fund medicines for the benefit of patients with a health need. The Committee considered that the funding criteria for adalimumab and for infliximab should be amended to allow use of higher doses of these pharmaceuticals for IBD, and that the criteria could allow (not mandate) TDM or dose modelling based on specific guidelines.</p><p>3.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the amended funding criteria would apply to patients with PNR for whom dose adjustment would be justified, and to those with LOR who may have ADAs and for whom dose adjustment may be appropriate in some cases. The Committee considered that the funding criteria could be simplified to allow escalation of doses to reach therapeutic levels, and criteria to state that dose escalation should not be performed in patients with therapeutic drug levels (who are being adequately treated) or patients with high levels of neutralising ADAs (who would not receive any further benefit from the drug). The Committee considered that PHARMAC staff could develop criteria with input from Gastroenterologists if required.</p><p>3.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that TDM strategies may be applicable to treatment with adalimumab or infliximab in other indications, although evidence for other indications was not considered at this time due to the focus of this application for the treatment of IBD, however, evidence regarding the use of TDM in other indications could be considered at future meetings.</p>",

PTAC had considered that there was evidence to support higher doses in some patients determined by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). There was also evidence that some patients may be under-dosed with current restrictions. PTAC had requested PHARMAC staff provide a paper on TDM of biologics for gastrointestinal conditions, and PTAC had highlighted specific concerns regarding uncertainty of benefits and uncertainty of the extent to which the approach would change usage, due to low quality evidence.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that both adalimumab and infliximab are anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibodies, also called biologic treatments, and that both are Medsafe-approved for use as induction and maintenance treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and adalimumab is funded for the treatment of CD. The Committee noted that there is increased competition in this market with the introduction of biosimilars, and new monoclonal antibodies with different molecular targets, and that commercial processes may provide opportunities for widening access for these agents.</p><p>3.5.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that adalimumab is funded for use in adults and children with CD and in patients with fistulising CD, with an initial 3 to 6 month induction period that has no dosing restriction, however, the renewal criteria include a maximum dose of no greater than 40 mg every 14 days.</p><p>3.5.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for use in adults and children with CD, patients with fistulising CD, patients with severe fulminant UC and patients with severe UC, to be administered at doses up to 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee noted that infliximab doses of up to 10 mg per kg every 8 weeks (or equivalent) \u2013 treatment re-induction \u2013 can be used for up to 3 doses if required for secondary non-response, and that another re-induction may be considered 16 weeks after completing the last re-induction cycle.</p><p>3.5.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC has previously considered, and PHARMAC has ranked, funding applications for weekly dosing of adalimumab for CD (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000Lmll/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for CD, rescue therapy</a>, on the Application Tracker), and for adalimumab for the treatment of UC (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000M59B/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, first-line</a> and <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000LmUg/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, second-line</a>, on the Application Tracker).</p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that primary loss of response, so-called primary non-response (PNR), occurs in about 10-30% of patients with IBD, where patients do not respond to induction treatment with biologics. Secondary loss of response (LOR) occurs in patients who respond to induction therapy but lose this response during maintenance treatment. Secondary LOR is potentially due to anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), immune mechanisms, and/or inadequate drug concentrations.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ADAs may be neutralising, modifying the drug binding site and directly affecting therapeutic response; or non-neutralising, increasing drug clearance through the immune system and thereby leading to reduced therapeutic effect. The Committee noted that a New Zealand study of 103 patients (84 with CD, 17 with UC and 2 with unclassified IBD) who received either adalimumab or infliximab reported that neutralising and non-neutralising ADAs were more common in patients with trough drug concentrations less than 2 mg/L (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30091273\" target=\"_blank\">Barclay et al.

Trial-based indices are not used routinely in clinical practice because of concerns about their utility outside randomised controlled trials. Disease assessment for IBD in clinical practice may use any, or all, of: the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), endoscopy, testing for C-reactive protein (CRP), and faecal calprotectin.</p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with IBD who receive anti-TNF treatment may have a health need due to primary or secondary loss of response to this treatment, as described. Members considered that patients with IBD for whom anti-TNF treatment is not effective may opt to try another biologic agent with a different mechanism of action, although these are not currently funded. Otherwise surgery could be considered. Members considered that optimising anti-TNF treatment may be better than changing treatment or considering surgery for such patients.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence that some patients in New Zealand with IBD already receive higher doses of infliximab than the maintenance dosing of 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee considered that use of higher doses may be due to clinician preference, interpretation of the infliximab funding restrictions on the hospital medicines list (introduction and re-introduction), and the practicalities of episodic use in clinics where the remainder of a vial is given to a patient instead of being discarded. Members noted that, until recently, PHARMAC did not have patient level data for infliximab use in DHB hospitals.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that target concentrations for anti-TNF agents may depend on disease severity, but that the optimal target drug concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab were unclear. Members considered that recommended target concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab in the treatment of IBD have increased with time. However, the Committee considered that there was limited supporting evidence for particular target concentrations.</p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a treatment strategy that uses a target drug concentration rather than a target dose. Members noted that TDM may use a variety of dosing strategies including, but not limited to: stepwise dosing, proportional dosing, or model-based dosing. Members considered that it is unclear whether disease symptoms should mediate decisions on drug dosing, or whether use of TDM is a superior strategy in IBD. The Committee noted that TDM is already used around New Zealand for the management of patients who receive adalimumab or infliximab for the treatment of IBD. However, Members noted that uptake of TDM for IBD is not consistent around New Zealand, although has likely increased following the recent publication of New Zealand guidelines (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845128\" target=\"_blank\">Khan et al.

This can involve eg. dose alteration and concentration re-measurement until therapeutic dose achieved; peak and trough concentration measurement to determine clearance; and then dose determination using other clinical measurements. The Committee noted that dose modelling may be influenced by variables that affect drug concentration. This can include drug clearance, protein breakdown, binding targets, ADAs, disease severity, comorbidities eg. obesity, or other drugs such as methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids.</p><p>3.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that assessment of response in TDM includes some measurements of disease activity that may not be sensitive or specific, eg. CRP, and also technical issues of assay, such as measurement of bound and unbound drug, to best manage this condition. Members considered that, ideally, TDM would use an optimal modelling strategy to measure and promptly reach an optimal target concentration for any given patient with IBD.</p><p>3.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered whether the maximum funded doses of adalimumab and infliximab should be increased for the treatment of patients with IBD who are not responding to their current treatment, for either or both of PNR or LOR. The Committee considered that the question of whether a TDM strategy or another mechanism is required to clinically support the rationale for dose escalation and de-escalation was a secondary consideration that did not necessarily need to be determined in the funding criteria for these agents.</p><p>3.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from a double-blind, controlled trial of infliximab maintenance for 54 weeks in 122 biologic-na\u00efve adult patients with active CD who were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either: up to 2 dose increases with steps of 2.5 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms, biomarker analysis and/or serum infliximab concentrations (dose intensification strategy 1, DIS1); a dose increase from 5 to 10 mg/kg based on the same criteria (DIS2); or a dose increase to 10 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms alone (controls) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317275\" target=\"_blank\">D\u2019Haens et al.

N Z Med J. 2019:132;46-62</a>). The Committee noted that this guideline suggests TDM in IBD may be cost-saving, may result in fewer disease-related complications, and may reduce the need for surgery. The Committee considered that the guideline is limited by the use of a subjective scoring system, and that the evidence for benefit is largely based on studies reporting retrospective cohort studies. Members noted the limitations with this level of evidence that can bias estimates of efficacy. The Committee also noted that the recommended approach does not cover use of higher drug concentrations, criteria for dose de-escalation, or criteria for treatment cessation. Without the latter, patients could potentially continue on treatment even if it was not providing a benefit.</p><p>3.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that TDM with adalimumab and infliximab for IBD is performed internationally and that this is supported by consensus statements. The Committee noted the following Australian and British guidelines and consensus statements for TDM of adalimumab and infliximab in IBD:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027257\" target=\"_blank\">Mitrev et al.

There is also evidence that there is a positive association between treatment outcomes and drug concentrations. However, the extent of the influence of other important clinical characteristics on these relationships is difficult to quantify. The Committee considered that use of higher doses than currently funded to reach higher concentrations of adalimumab and infliximab for IBD were supported by the evidence reviewed. The Committee also noted that there were no head-to-head trials that compared adalimumab to infliximab for the treatment of IBD, and that comparison of the benefits of these two pharmaceuticals is therefore unclear.</p><p>3.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence base for benefits from TDM in IBD was weak. The Committee considered that TDM was a tool that could offer benefits such as identifying patients who require a higher dose and may help to determine if low drug concentrations are due to ADAs compared to disease severity. The Committee considered that the TDM strategy for IBD proposed by the applicant and in the evidence reviewed fell short of the detailed modelling seen in other TDM strategies. The Committee considered that this TDM approach does not specify appropriate higher doses, facilitate decision-making for treatment cessation, or guide a patient\u2019s duration on treatment. Members considered that the proposed TDM strategy could result in unnecessary dose increases for patients with good disease control, if their drug concentrations fell below the TDM-specified threshold.</p><p>3.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that identification of patients who could benefit from higher therapeutic doses could also be done through assessment of response. The Committee also noted that a change in target concentration is known to be required for some patient subgroups eg. intraluminal CD or severe CD phenotypes, where increased drug concentrations are required.</p><p>3.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that there is unlikely to be an increase in adverse events associated with the use of higher therapeutic doses of adalimumab or infliximab, with or without TDM, due to the target therapeutic dose. Members considered that a reduction in inflammation would benefit patients with IBD by reducing their risk of developing cancer.</p><p>3.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the effect of increased dosing or treatment cessation based on TDM on cost-effectiveness analyses was unclear. This is because there is insufficient evidence to estimate the extent of the incremental benefits. The Committee noted that drug costs would be higher due to increased doses. Members considered that the costs of increased treatment doses may be balanced by reduction in hospital admissions, dose de-escalations and surgeries, however, long-term study data would be needed to better estimate changes to these resource costs. Members considered that cost-savings could result from a reduction in surgery if there was a substantial increase in remission rates, and from treatment cessation in patients who were not receiving a benefit from adalimumab or infliximab. The Committee considered that it was unclear whether patients who previously used and discontinued biologic treatment for IBD would receive this treatment again.</p><p>3.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that resource requirements for clinic assessments, laboratory tests, patient monitoring and physician training would be the same as those currently required, because TDM is currently used for management of IBD in NZ. The Committee noted that drug concentration and ADA tests are performed only in Christchurch with a reasonable turnaround time of 4 weeks, however, it was unclear which drug form(s) are measured eg. unbound, bound and/or total. Members considered that it was uncertain whether one laboratory could sufficiently perform testing for all NZ IBD patients if required. However, it seemed likely that turnaround times would be appropriate for long-term monitoring for disease management. Members considered that close monitoring may provide a benefit with regard to patient adherence with treatment, and that TDM could help rationalise the use of other pharmaceuticals.</p><p>3.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the current evidence for the proposed use of TDM and measurement of ADAs to adjust dosing of adalimumab and infliximab in IBD was insufficient to inform a recommendation. The Committee noted that PHARMAC\u2019s role is not to specify management but to fund medicines for the benefit of patients with a health need. The Committee considered that the funding criteria for adalimumab and for infliximab should be amended to allow use of higher doses of these pharmaceuticals for IBD, and that the criteria could allow (not mandate) TDM or dose modelling based on specific guidelines.</p><p>3.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the amended funding criteria would apply to patients with PNR for whom dose adjustment would be justified, and to those with LOR who may have ADAs and for whom dose adjustment may be appropriate in some cases. The Committee considered that the funding criteria could be simplified to allow escalation of doses to reach therapeutic levels, and criteria to state that dose escalation should not be performed in patients with therapeutic drug levels (who are being adequately treated) or patients with high levels of neutralising ADAs (who would not receive any further benefit from the drug). The Committee considered that PHARMAC staff could develop criteria with input from Gastroenterologists if required.</p><p>3.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that TDM strategies may be applicable to treatment with adalimumab or infliximab in other indications, although evidence for other indications was not considered at this time due to the focus of this application for the treatment of IBD, however, evidence regarding the use of TDM in other indications could be considered at future meetings.</p>",

PTAC had considered that there was evidence to support higher doses in some patients determined by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). There was also evidence that some patients may be under-dosed with current restrictions. PTAC had requested PHARMAC staff provide a paper on TDM of biologics for gastrointestinal conditions, and PTAC had highlighted specific concerns regarding uncertainty of benefits and uncertainty of the extent to which the approach would change usage, due to low quality evidence.</p><p>3.5<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that both adalimumab and infliximab are anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibodies, also called biologic treatments, and that both are Medsafe-approved for use as induction and maintenance treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and adalimumab is funded for the treatment of CD. The Committee noted that there is increased competition in this market with the introduction of biosimilars, and new monoclonal antibodies with different molecular targets, and that commercial processes may provide opportunities for widening access for these agents.</p><p>3.5.1<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that adalimumab is funded for use in adults and children with CD and in patients with fistulising CD, with an initial 3 to 6 month induction period that has no dosing restriction, however, the renewal criteria include a maximum dose of no greater than 40 mg every 14 days.</p><p>3.5.2<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that infliximab is funded for use in adults and children with CD, patients with fistulising CD, patients with severe fulminant UC and patients with severe UC, to be administered at doses up to 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee noted that infliximab doses of up to 10 mg per kg every 8 weeks (or equivalent) \u2013 treatment re-induction \u2013 can be used for up to 3 doses if required for secondary non-response, and that another re-induction may be considered 16 weeks after completing the last re-induction cycle.</p><p>3.5.3<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC has previously considered, and PHARMAC has ranked, funding applications for weekly dosing of adalimumab for CD (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000Lmll/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for CD, rescue therapy</a>, on the Application Tracker), and for adalimumab for the treatment of UC (see <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000M59B/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, first-line</a> and <a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a0R2P000000LmUg/adalimumab\" target=\"_blank\">Adalimumab for moderate to severely active UC, second-line</a>, on the Application Tracker).</p><p>3.6<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that primary loss of response, so-called primary non-response (PNR), occurs in about 10-30% of patients with IBD, where patients do not respond to induction treatment with biologics. Secondary loss of response (LOR) occurs in patients who respond to induction therapy but lose this response during maintenance treatment. Secondary LOR is potentially due to anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), immune mechanisms, and/or inadequate drug concentrations.</p><p>3.7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that ADAs may be neutralising, modifying the drug binding site and directly affecting therapeutic response; or non-neutralising, increasing drug clearance through the immune system and thereby leading to reduced therapeutic effect. The Committee noted that a New Zealand study of 103 patients (84 with CD, 17 with UC and 2 with unclassified IBD) who received either adalimumab or infliximab reported that neutralising and non-neutralising ADAs were more common in patients with trough drug concentrations less than 2 mg/L (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30091273\" target=\"_blank\">Barclay et al. Intern Med J. 2019:49;513-18</a>).</p><p>3.8<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that monitoring disease states is challenging in IBD. Trial-based indices are not used routinely in clinical practice because of concerns about their utility outside randomised controlled trials. Disease assessment for IBD in clinical practice may use any, or all, of: the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), endoscopy, testing for C-reactive protein (CRP), and faecal calprotectin.</p><p>3.9<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that patients with IBD who receive anti-TNF treatment may have a health need due to primary or secondary loss of response to this treatment, as described. Members considered that patients with IBD for whom anti-TNF treatment is not effective may opt to try another biologic agent with a different mechanism of action, although these are not currently funded. Otherwise surgery could be considered. Members considered that optimising anti-TNF treatment may be better than changing treatment or considering surgery for such patients.</p><p>3.10<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence that some patients in New Zealand with IBD already receive higher doses of infliximab than the maintenance dosing of 5 mg per kg every 8 weeks. The Committee considered that use of higher doses may be due to clinician preference, interpretation of the infliximab funding restrictions on the hospital medicines list (introduction and re-introduction), and the practicalities of episodic use in clinics where the remainder of a vial is given to a patient instead of being discarded. Members noted that, until recently, PHARMAC did not have patient level data for infliximab use in DHB hospitals.</p><p>3.11<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that target concentrations for anti-TNF agents may depend on disease severity, but that the optimal target drug concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab were unclear. Members considered that recommended target concentrations for adalimumab and infliximab in the treatment of IBD have increased with time. However, the Committee considered that there was limited supporting evidence for particular target concentrations.</p><p>3.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a treatment strategy that uses a target drug concentration rather than a target dose. Members noted that TDM may use a variety of dosing strategies including, but not limited to: stepwise dosing, proportional dosing, or model-based dosing. Members considered that it is unclear whether disease symptoms should mediate decisions on drug dosing, or whether use of TDM is a superior strategy in IBD. The Committee noted that TDM is already used around New Zealand for the management of patients who receive adalimumab or infliximab for the treatment of IBD. However, Members noted that uptake of TDM for IBD is not consistent around New Zealand, although has likely increased following the recent publication of New Zealand guidelines (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845128\" target=\"_blank\">Khan et al. N Z Med J. 2019:132;46-62</a>).</p><p>3.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that TDM strategies may use sequential measurements for dose determination including drug concentration measurement. This can involve eg. dose alteration and concentration re-measurement until therapeutic dose achieved; peak and trough concentration measurement to determine clearance; and then dose determination using other clinical measurements. The Committee noted that dose modelling may be influenced by variables that affect drug concentration. This can include drug clearance, protein breakdown, binding targets, ADAs, disease severity, comorbidities eg. obesity, or other drugs such as methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids.</p><p>3.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that assessment of response in TDM includes some measurements of disease activity that may not be sensitive or specific, eg. CRP, and also technical issues of assay, such as measurement of bound and unbound drug, to best manage this condition. Members considered that, ideally, TDM would use an optimal modelling strategy to measure and promptly reach an optimal target concentration for any given patient with IBD.</p><p>3.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered whether the maximum funded doses of adalimumab and infliximab should be increased for the treatment of patients with IBD who are not responding to their current treatment, for either or both of PNR or LOR. The Committee considered that the question of whether a TDM strategy or another mechanism is required to clinically support the rationale for dose escalation and de-escalation was a secondary consideration that did not necessarily need to be determined in the funding criteria for these agents.</p><p>3.16<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted evidence from a double-blind, controlled trial of infliximab maintenance for 54 weeks in 122 biologic-na\u00efve adult patients with active CD who were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either: up to 2 dose increases with steps of 2.5 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms, biomarker analysis and/or serum infliximab concentrations (dose intensification strategy 1, DIS1); a dose increase from 5 to 10 mg/kg based on the same criteria (DIS2); or a dose increase to 10 mg/kg based on clinical symptoms alone (controls) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317275\" target=\"_blank\">D\u2019Haens et al.

N Z Med J. 2019:132;46-62</a>). The Committee noted that this guideline suggests TDM in IBD may be cost-saving, may result in fewer disease-related complications, and may reduce the need for surgery. The Committee considered that the guideline is limited by the use of a subjective scoring system, and that the evidence for benefit is largely based on studies reporting retrospective cohort studies. Members noted the limitations with this level of evidence that can bias estimates of efficacy. The Committee also noted that the recommended approach does not cover use of higher drug concentrations, criteria for dose de-escalation, or criteria for treatment cessation. Without the latter, patients could potentially continue on treatment even if it was not providing a benefit.</p><p>3.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that TDM with adalimumab and infliximab for IBD is performed internationally and that this is supported by consensus statements. The Committee noted the following Australian and British guidelines and consensus statements for TDM of adalimumab and infliximab in IBD:</p><p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027257\" target=\"_blank\">Mitrev et al.

Gut. 2019;68(Suppl 3):s1-s106</a></p><p>3.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is a positive, albeit non-linear, association between higher drug doses and higher exposure to free adalimumab or infliximab. There is also evidence that there is a positive association between treatment outcomes and drug concentrations. However, the extent of the influence of other important clinical characteristics on these relationships is difficult to quantify. The Committee considered that use of higher doses than currently funded to reach higher concentrations of adalimumab and infliximab for IBD were supported by the evidence reviewed. The Committee also noted that there were no head-to-head trials that compared adalimumab to infliximab for the treatment of IBD, and that comparison of the benefits of these two pharmaceuticals is therefore unclear.</p><p>3.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence base for benefits from TDM in IBD was weak. The Committee considered that TDM was a tool that could offer benefits such as identifying patients who require a higher dose and may help to determine if low drug concentrations are due to ADAs compared to disease severity. The Committee considered that the TDM strategy for IBD proposed by the applicant and in the evidence reviewed fell short of the detailed modelling seen in other TDM strategies. The Committee considered that this TDM approach does not specify appropriate higher doses, facilitate decision-making for treatment cessation, or guide a patient\u2019s duration on treatment. Members considered that the proposed TDM strategy could result in unnecessary dose increases for patients with good disease control, if their drug concentrations fell below the TDM-specified threshold.</p><p>3.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that identification of patients who could benefit from higher therapeutic doses could also be done through assessment of response. The Committee also noted that a change in target concentration is known to be required for some patient subgroups eg. intraluminal CD or severe CD phenotypes, where increased drug concentrations are required.</p><p>3.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Members considered that there is unlikely to be an increase in adverse events associated with the use of higher therapeutic doses of adalimumab or infliximab, with or without TDM, due to the target therapeutic dose. Members considered that a reduction in inflammation would benefit patients with IBD by reducing their risk of developing cancer.</p><p>3.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the effect of increased dosing or treatment cessation based on TDM on cost-effectiveness analyses was unclear. This is because there is insufficient evidence to estimate the extent of the incremental benefits. The Committee noted that drug costs would be higher due to increased doses. Members considered that the costs of increased treatment doses may be balanced by reduction in hospital admissions, dose de-escalations and surgeries, however, long-term study data would be needed to better estimate changes to these resource costs. Members considered that cost-savings could result from a reduction in surgery if there was a substantial increase in remission rates, and from treatment cessation in patients who were not receiving a benefit from adalimumab or infliximab. The Committee considered that it was unclear whether patients who previously used and discontinued biologic treatment for IBD would receive this treatment again.</p><p>3.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that resource requirements for clinic assessments, laboratory tests, patient monitoring and physician training would be the same as those currently required, because TDM is currently used for management of IBD in NZ. The Committee noted that drug concentration and ADA tests are performed only in Christchurch with a reasonable turnaround time of 4 weeks, however, it was unclear which drug form(s) are measured eg. unbound, bound and/or total. Members considered that it was uncertain whether one laboratory could sufficiently perform testing for all NZ IBD patients if required. However, it seemed likely that turnaround times would be appropriate for long-term monitoring for disease management. Members considered that close monitoring may provide a benefit with regard to patient adherence with treatment, and that TDM could help rationalise the use of other pharmaceuticals.</p><p>3.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the current evidence for the proposed use of TDM and measurement of ADAs to adjust dosing of adalimumab and infliximab in IBD was insufficient to inform a recommendation. The Committee noted that PHARMAC\u2019s role is not to specify management but to fund medicines for the benefit of patients with a health need. The Committee considered that the funding criteria for adalimumab and for infliximab should be amended to allow use of higher doses of these pharmaceuticals for IBD, and that the criteria could allow (not mandate) TDM or dose modelling based on specific guidelines.</p><p>3.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the amended funding criteria would apply to patients with PNR for whom dose adjustment would be justified, and to those with LOR who may have ADAs and for whom dose adjustment may be appropriate in some cases. The Committee considered that the funding criteria could be simplified to allow escalation of doses to reach therapeutic levels, and criteria to state that dose escalation should not be performed in patients with therapeutic drug levels (who are being adequately treated) or patients with high levels of neutralising ADAs (who would not receive any further benefit from the drug). The Committee considered that PHARMAC staff could develop criteria with input from Gastroenterologists if required.</p><p>3.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that TDM strategies may be applicable to treatment with adalimumab or infliximab in other indications, although evidence for other indications was not considered at this time due to the focus of this application for the treatment of IBD, however, evidence regarding the use of TDM in other indications could be considered at future meetings.</p>",
