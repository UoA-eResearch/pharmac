The Subcommittee noted that long-term data from the Phase 2 trials showed an annualised change in eGFR of -0.67 mL/min/1.73 m2/year over an average of 8.2 years of treatment. The Subcommittee considered that the results described above indicate that treatment with migalastat stabilises renal function, and that these results are particularly significant given that the standard rate of decline in renal function for healthy individuals is 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2/year.</p><p>1.12<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that data from the extension study of FACETS indicated a continued reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 5 years of treatment with migalastat, and that this reduction was most pronounced in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline.

The Subcommittee considered that while these publications do not include mention of migalastat, the evidence indicate that ERT significantly improve long-term outcomes for patients with Fabry disease.

However, the Subcommittee noted that the resubmission from Amicus was suggesting that both ERT and migalastat should be funded for the treatment of Fabry disease, with migalastat likely to be the more suitable treatment option for patients with amenable GLA mutations due to its oral administration (vs. intravenous administration for ERT) and a potentially reduced risk of anti-drug antibody formation.

The Subcommittee noted that the major clinical manifestations of classical Fabry disease include angiokeratomas, acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities, progressive renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. The Subcommittee noted that the life expectancy of individuals with untreated classical Fabry disease is reduced by more than 20 years (average age of death 41 years; Mehta &amp; Hughes.

The Subcommittee noted that migalastat is only effective in individuals with an amenable GLA mutation, which is approximately 35% to 50% of patients diagnosed with Fabry disease.</p><p>1.9<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that migalastat is not currently approved by Medsafe for the treatment of Fabry disease, but that it has regulatory approval in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Subcommittee noted that migalastat is not approved for any indication other than Fabry disease.</p><p>1.10<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the resubmission provided data from the clinical development program for migalastat, including longer-term unpublished data from ATTRACT, FACETS, and their extension studies, and a number of Phase 2 trials. </p><p>1.11<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the updated renal function data provided in the resubmission indicated that the annualised change in eGFR (using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) was 0.69 mL/min/1.73 m2/year in ERT-naïve patients receiving migalastat over an average of 3.4 years (FACETS extension), and was -1.08 mL/min/1.73 m2/year in ERT-switch patients after 4 years of treatment with migalastat (ATTRACT extension). The Subcommittee noted that long-term data from the Phase 2 trials showed an annualised change in eGFR of -0.67 mL/min/1.73 m2/year over an average of 8.2 years of treatment. The Subcommittee considered that the results described above indicate that treatment with migalastat stabilises renal function, and that these results are particularly significant given that the standard rate of decline in renal function for healthy individuals is 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2/year.</p><p>1.12<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that data from the extension study of FACETS indicated a continued reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 5 years of treatment with migalastat, and that this reduction was most pronounced in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline. Members noted that it remains unclear whether improvement in LVMI would be observed if cardiac fibrosis had already developed.</p><p>1.13<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the resubmission provided by the supplier also identified two recent reviews and a consensus statement regarding the effectiveness of ERT in Fabry disease (Germain et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2019;19:100454; Germain et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2019;126:224-235; Wanner et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2018;124:189-203). The Subcommittee considered that while these publications do not include mention of migalastat, the evidence indicate that ERT significantly improve long-term outcomes for patients with Fabry disease. The Subcommittee considered that these publications support its previous positive recommendation for agalsidase alfa (fund with a medium priority - November 2018).</p><p>1.14<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that ERT is the current standard of care in many countries for Fabry disease, and that it is therefore unlikely that extensive contemporary data describing the natural history of un-treated Fabry disease will ever be available.</p><p>1.15<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that migalastat is only effective in approximately 35% to 50% of patients with Fabry disease, and as such, funding only this agent would be inequitable to patients with Fabry disease without an amenable mutation. However, the Subcommittee noted that the resubmission from Amicus was suggesting that both ERT and migalastat should be funded for the treatment of Fabry disease, with migalastat likely to be the more suitable treatment option for patients with amenable GLA mutations due to its oral administration (vs. intravenous administration for ERT) and a potentially reduced risk of anti-drug antibody formation. The Subcommittee agreed that migalastat should only be considered for funding in the context of ERT potentially being funded for Fabry disease. </p><p>1.16<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the prevalence of Fabry disease in New Zealand remains unclear, with estimates ranging from 1 in 60,000 to 1 in 117,000 live births. Members considered a personal communication about the latest data from the National Referral Laboratory in Australia that indicated prevalence is as high as 1 in 20,000, which would correlate to approximately 245 patients with Fabry disease in New Zealand. Members considered that the prevalence could vary significantly based on the identification of large affected families.</p><p>1.17<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier used an estimated prevalence of Fabry disease of 1 in 60,000 to calculate that there would be 7 patients eligible for migalastat in Year 1, increasing to 13 patients by Year 5. The Subcommittee considered that the recent Australian prevalence data from the National Referral Laboratory noted above suggests that there would be likely to be significantly more patients who may be eligible for migalastat than the supplier has estimated.</p><p>1.18<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if migalastat or ERT were funded for the treatment of Fabry disease, that it would be important for patients to be included in a registry in order for New Zealand specific data to be collected, and to help evidence development internationally. </p><p>1.19<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that patients receiving Fabry-specific treatments would still require concomitant medications such as antihypertensives, statins, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>1.20<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the cost effectiveness of migalastat at the proposed price is poor, but that the supplier has indicated that the price can be discussed further with PHARMAC. The Subcommittee considered that, based on the clinical evidence indicating that migalastat is non-inferior to ERT, the price of migalastat should be cost neutral to the price of ERT. The Subcommittee considered that migalastat should be included alongside ERT in any competitive procurement process that PHARMAC may undertake in the future for Fabry disease.</p><p>1.21<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the updated evidence provided in the resubmission indicates that treatment with migalastat results in long-term stabilisation of renal and cardiac function in patients with Fabry Disease, and that this evidence was sufficient to support a positive recommendation for migalastat in the context of also recommending the funding of ERT.</p><p>1.22<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered the proposed Special Authority criteria and advised that the initial period of approval should be longer than 12 months as it is unlikely a therapeutic response would occur sooner that 24 months, given that the aim of treatment would be to reduce the rate of decline in renal function or reduce the cardiac hypertrophy.\xa0\xa0</p>', 'PTAC_Comments__c': '<p>1.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the Rare Disorders Subcommittee had considered a resubmission from the supplier of migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease. The Committee noted the Subcommittee recommendation that migalastat be funded with a medium priority, subject to Special Authority criteria, in the context of the rare disorders therapeutic area and any future funding of an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry disease. Given that migalastat is reportedly only effective in patients with an amenable mutation (approximately 35 - 50% of Fabry patients), PTAC considered that any potential funding considerations for migalastat would be contingent on also considering ERT for Fabry disease; and that it considered this approach would be necessary to ensure equitable access for all Fabry patients. PTAC noted the Subcommittee at its November 2018 meeting recommended funding of ERT for Fabry disease with a medium priority, however, in February 2019 PTAC recommended the application for agalsidase alfa, an ERT for Fabry disease, be declined based on insufficient evidence of long-term beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality.

The Committee noted that genetic testing occurs less frequently in Māori and therefore genetic variants that are more common in Māori may not be identified. In addition renal and cardiac impairments may be misdiagnosed as other health conditions eg. essential hypertension or type 2 diabetes. The Committee considered that Māori were not apparently overrepresented in those with Fabry identified disease, but noting potential barriers to accessing health services including referral to metabolic services with delays in diagnosis/ treatment.</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted it had previously considered applications for agalsidase alfa and migalastat.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee recommended in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-rare-disorders-subcommittee-minutes-2018-11.pdf"" target=""_blank"">November 2018</a> that agalsidase alfa be funded with a medium priority for the treatment of Fabry disease based on high health need, a lack of alternative treatment options, and low-to-moderate level of evidence, including non-randomised cohort study comparative evidence of benefit, subject to the Special Authority criteria.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee recommended in <a href=""https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008pu0n/p000444"" target=""_blank"">September 2019</a> that migalastat be funded with a medium priority following a resubmission by the supplier which addressed concerns regarding the long term effectiveness and treatment costs.

Enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, also known as ceramide trihexoside), as well as digalactosyl ceramide and blood group B, B1, and P1 glycolipids in the lysosomes of vascular endothelial, smooth muscle, epithelial, and ganglion cells.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted incidental commentary in the <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2002/03000/natural_history_of_fabry_renal_disease__influence.3.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Branton et al. Medicine (Baltimore). 2002;81:122-38</a> longitudinal follow-up study, describing how major sites of storage of Gb3 and globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) include vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, peripheral neurons in autonomic and dorsal root ganglia, cardiomyocytes, kidney epithelial cells (podocytes, parietal layer of glomerular capsule, tubular epithelium) and endothelial cells, which can lead to inflammation, proliferation, and fibrosis</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16773563/"" target=""_blank"">Spada et al, Am J Hum Genet. 2006;79:31-40</a> study of newborn infants screened in Italy, which reported a prevalence of 1 in 40,000-117,000 males, which could be as high as 1 in 3100 if late-onset disease is included.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Fabry disease is inherited on the X chromosome and thus clinically affects males more frequently and severely than females. The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29530533/"" target=""_blank"">Ortiz et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2018;123:416-27</a> treatment recommendations, which outlined the typical diagnosis for males, whereby enzyme activity was measured in white blood cells, dried blood spots and fibroblasts. In the classic form of Fabry disease there was less than 1% enzyme activity. The Committee noted that in the common Taiwanese variant of Fabry disease, people can have borderline levels of enzymatic activity. In females with Fabry disease, the disease is more molecular in pathology, with at least 40% of symptomatic heterozygotes maintaining normal to slightly low α-gal A activity. Other biochemistry such as plasma and urine can be used to test of Gb3 and lysoGb3 levels. In females with late onset variants of Fabry disease these levels may also appear in normal range. Other methods of diagnosis include immunohistology of affected tissues.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that &gt;900 variants reported in the GLA gene, which can limit the genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Later onset/atypical (missense or splicing variants) variants can include the “cardiac variant” pAsn215Ser (pN215S) – whereby left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are typically diagnosed after 50 years. Other gene mutations linked to phenotypes include the cardiac or classical phenotypes linked with p.Arg112His, p.Arg301Gln, p.Gly328Arg and asymptomatic or disease causing pAsp313Tyr. The IVS4+919G&gt;A mutation has been identified in individuals with Taiwanese ancestry.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that women who present with heterozygous Fabry disease are variably affected, and clinical manifestations of the disease can present 10 years after males who are affected. The Committee noted that disease course can vary depending on gender, environment and GLA variant.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee members were made aware that Fabry disease affects multiple systems and is quality of life limiting. This includes pain which manifests as small fibre neuropathy, episodic acroparasthesiae (painful numbness, burning and tingling of the extremities) and pain crises which the Committee noted were often referred to as ‘Fabry days’, as well as extreme fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also common with diarrhoea and pain, as well as angiokeratomas and hypohidrosis (inadequate sweating). The Committee noted that hyperhidrosis was uncommonly observed, and typically presented in 11.9% females and 6.4% males (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20660166/"" target=""_blank"">Mehta et al, QJM. 2010;103:641-59</a>). The Committee members were made aware of other symptoms involved the eyes with 73% of males and 77% of females affected by vortex keratopathy ‘cornea verticillata’, as well as conjunctival and retinal vasculopathy that is known to correlate with disease severity. In addition, 30% of males experience a posterior lens cataract which is referred to as “Fabry” cataract. In addition to the eyes, other sensory organs are also affected with 50-60% experiencing sensorineural hearing loss, as well as tinnitus and vertigo.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949010/"" target=""_blank"">Bolsolver et al. J Inherit Metab Dis 2014;37:177-87</a> systematic review, with people with Fabry disease having an increased risk of depression, low mood and fatigue.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee members were made aware that the main causes of death for those with Fabry disease were cardiac, renal, stroke and suicide. Cardiac symptoms typically commence around 30-40 years of age, with left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmias, with cardiac death the leading cause of death for 34% of males and 57% of females. In the kidneys, proteinuria can lead to renal failure, with a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) function. The Committee noted that this was the leading cause of death in 42% (males) of those with Fabry disease prior to enzyme replacement therapy. Cerebrovascular disease accounted for 25% (females) of deaths prior to 2001, and pulmonary features such as chronic bronchitis or a wheeze with obstructive pattern can occur (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473999/"" target=""_blank"">Mehta et al, J Med Genet 2009;46:548-52</a>).\xa0</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949010/"" target=""_blank"">Bolsolver et al. 2014 </a>systematic review’s reporting that people with Fabry disease have an increased risk of suicide that is greater than other disorders associated with chronic pain. Overall, the Committee noted that life expectancy of those with Fabry disease is 58.2 in males and 75.4 in females.</p><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the current treatment options in New Zealand were monitoring and review of the individual, with treatment to alleviate symptoms, and treat the presentation of the disease. The Committee noted that renal disease is often not diagnosed early, as proteinuria is not significant until rapid reduction in eGFR. The Committee considered the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418971/#appsec1"" target=""_blank"">Ng et al. Kidney Int Rep. 2021;6:2481–85</a> study analysing ANZDATA Australia/New Zealand renal dialysis and transplant registrations, which reported worse morbidity and mortality outcomes from dialysis and kidney transplant in those with Fabry disease.</p><p>1.25.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered evidence from the New Zealand National Metabolic Service Basic Clinical database, which estimated over time it had identified approximately 65 people with Fabry disease. Of these approximately 10 had died, whilst there were around 55 live individuals, of which 43 were female. The Committee noted that females were overrepresented and were often diagnosed due to their fathers dying of the disease. The Committee noted that less genetic testing occurs in Māori. It may be possible that specific variants are more common in the Māori population and that these may be missed through standard genomic testing, as was the case with the common Taiwanese intronic variant IVS4+919G&gt;A.</p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered further evidence from the New Zealand National Metabolic Service Basic Clinical database that estimated that currently in Aotearoa New Zealand there were 18 people who had significant disease burden or deteriorating end organ disease who were considered would benefit from treatment. It was estimated that of the total people recorded in the database who have active disease (n=55), 30 have migalastat responsive mutations, with a small number continuing to receive migalastat from the supplier as part of a compassionate access programme from the original migalastat clinical trial\xa0(AT1001),who were said to all be receiving good benefit.</p><p>1.27.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee members were made aware that symptomatic males and females currently had quality of life-limiting pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and fatigue, as well as some with progressive cardiomyopathy and cardiac conduction defects. The Committee members were made aware that a number of those with symptomatic Fabry disease had mild proteinuria, although none of those people recorded in the New Zealand Metabolic database currently have progressive and severe renal failure, or major issues with cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. There are several individuals who have an unusual phenotype with severe gastrointestinal disease and interstitial lung disease.</p><p>1.28.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that there was likely to be a higher number of those with Fabry disease in New Zealand than currently seen at the National Metabolic Service, due to lack of diagnosis or genetic testing.

In females with Fabry disease, the disease is more molecular in pathology, with at least 40% of symptomatic heterozygotes maintaining normal to slightly low α-gal A activity. Other biochemistry such as plasma and urine can be used to test of Gb3 and lysoGb3 levels. In females with late onset variants of Fabry disease these levels may also appear in normal range.

Enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, also known as ceramide trihexoside), as well as digalactosyl ceramide and blood group B, B1, and P1 glycolipids in the lysosomes of vascular endothelial, smooth muscle, epithelial, and ganglion cells.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted incidental commentary in the <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2002/03000/natural_history_of_fabry_renal_disease__influence.3.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Branton et al.

The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29530533/"" target=""_blank"">Ortiz et al. Mol Genet Metab. 2018;123:416-27</a> treatment recommendations, which outlined the typical diagnosis for males, whereby enzyme activity was measured in white blood cells, dried blood spots and fibroblasts. In the classic form of Fabry disease there was less than 1% enzyme activity. The Committee noted that in the common Taiwanese variant of Fabry disease, people can have borderline levels of enzymatic activity. In females with Fabry disease, the disease is more molecular in pathology, with at least 40% of symptomatic heterozygotes maintaining normal to slightly low α-gal A activity. Other biochemistry such as plasma and urine can be used to test of Gb3 and lysoGb3 levels. In females with late onset variants of Fabry disease these levels may also appear in normal range. Other methods of diagnosis include immunohistology of affected tissues.</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that &gt;900 variants reported in the GLA gene, which can limit the genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Later onset/atypical (missense or splicing variants) variants can include the “cardiac variant” pAsn215Ser (pN215S) – whereby left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are typically diagnosed after 50 years. Other gene mutations linked to phenotypes include the cardiac or classical phenotypes linked with p.Arg112His, p.Arg301Gln, p.Gly328Arg and asymptomatic or disease causing pAsp313Tyr. The IVS4+919G&gt;A mutation has been identified in individuals with Taiwanese ancestry.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that women who present with heterozygous Fabry disease are variably affected, and clinical manifestations of the disease can present 10 years after males who are affected. The Committee noted that disease course can vary depending on gender, environment and GLA variant.</p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee members were made aware that Fabry disease affects multiple systems and is quality of life limiting. This includes pain which manifests as small fibre neuropathy, episodic acroparasthesiae (painful numbness, burning and tingling of the extremities) and pain crises which the Committee noted were often referred to as ‘Fabry days’, as well as extreme fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also common with diarrhoea and pain, as well as angiokeratomas and hypohidrosis (inadequate sweating). The Committee noted that hyperhidrosis was uncommonly observed, and typically presented in 11.9% females and 6.4% males (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20660166/"" target=""_blank"">Mehta et al, QJM. 2010;103:641-59</a>). The Committee members were made aware of other symptoms involved the eyes with 73% of males and 77% of females affected by vortex keratopathy ‘cornea verticillata’, as well as conjunctival and retinal vasculopathy that is known to correlate with disease severity. In addition, 30% of males experience a posterior lens cataract which is referred to as “Fabry” cataract. In addition to the eyes, other sensory organs are also affected with 50-60% experiencing sensorineural hearing loss, as well as tinnitus and vertigo.</p><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949010/"" target=""_blank"">Bolsolver et al.

Cardiac symptoms typically commence around 30-40 years of age, with left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmias, with cardiac death the leading cause of death for 34% of males and 57% of females. In the kidneys, proteinuria can lead to renal failure, with a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) function. The Committee noted that this was the leading cause of death in 42% (males) of those with Fabry disease prior to enzyme replacement therapy. Cerebrovascular disease accounted for 25% (females) of deaths prior to 2001, and pulmonary features such as chronic bronchitis or a wheeze with obstructive pattern can occur (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473999/"" target=""_blank"">Mehta et al, J Med Genet 2009;46:548-52</a>).\xa0</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949010/"" target=""_blank"">Bolsolver et al. 2014 </a>systematic review’s reporting that people with Fabry disease have an increased risk of suicide that is greater than other disorders associated with chronic pain.

Of these approximately 10 had died, whilst there were around 55 live individuals, of which 43 were female. The Committee noted that females were overrepresented and were often diagnosed due to their fathers dying of the disease. The Committee noted that less genetic testing occurs in Māori. It may be possible that specific variants are more common in the Māori population and that these may be missed through standard genomic testing, as was the case with the common Taiwanese intronic variant IVS4+919G&gt;A.</p><p>1.26.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered further evidence from the New Zealand National Metabolic Service Basic Clinical database that estimated that currently in Aotearoa New Zealand there were 18 people who had significant disease burden or deteriorating end organ disease who were considered would benefit from treatment.

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
