The Committee noted that it was unclear why this may be but considered that lower curative resection rates in the M\u0101ori patient population may be due to later presentation of NSCLC, or lower referral to, or suitability for, curative resection. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also had the lowest overall survival of all ethnic groups.

The Committee noted that there are currently no funded targeted options for adjuvant therapy following resection of EGFRm positive NSCLC, and that patients currently receive platinum-based chemotherapy if deemed necessary or appropriate following surgery, followed by docetaxel upon progression. The Committee noted that if osimertinib were offered as adjuvant treatment, this would be as monotherapy, as there is no evidence that using it in combination with chemotherapy provides additional benefit. The Committee noted that the 2021 Te Aho o Te Kahu report indicated that of those diagnosed with NSCLC, systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 32.0% of M\u0101ori patients, 37.7% of Pacific patients, 42.4% of Asian patients, and 27.0% of NZ European/Other patients.

The Committee noted that for the overall population the disease-free survival at 24 months was 89% in the osimertinib group (95% CI 85 to 92) compared to 52% with placebo (95% CI 46 to 58), with an HR for recurrence or death of 0.20 (99.12% CI 0.14 to 0.30). The Committee noted that the overall survival data for the ADAURA trial was immature, but that double the number of patients in the placebo arm compared to the osimertinib treatment arm had died at 24 months. The Committee also noted that there were no new safety concerns reported.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.15.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that subgroup analysis reported that all subgroups favoured osimertinib for HRs for disease recurrence or death, including disease stage, EGFR mutation, age, and race. The Committee also noted that the probability of CNS disease-free survival was significantly better for the osimertinib treated group compared to the placebo group (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.33). The Committee considered it was unclear how the CNS disease-free survival affected the overall survival but considered that any impact on CNS disease free survival was important. The Committee noted that osimertinib is known to have better blood-brain-barrier penetration than other TKIs. The Committee noted that osimertinib had a higher incidence of grade three adverse events compared to placebo but considered that these were all in the scope of general oncological practice.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted separately published health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results from the ADAURA trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35012927/\" target=\"_blank\">Majem et al.

The Committee noted that HRQoL was measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, then every 24 weeks until recurrence or treatment completion/discontinuation. The Committee noted that there were no clinically meaningful differences in HRQoL reported between treatment arms. The Committee noted that the time to deterioration for both mental and physical in the HRQoL study was the same between treatment arms and considered that this reflected patients\u2019 relatively good health status at early-stage disease. The Committee noted that patients in the placebo group were switched to the osimertinib treatment arm upon recurrence and considered that this may be why the HRQoL results between the groups were so similar.

The Committee noted that it was unclear why this may be but considered that lower curative resection rates in the M\u0101ori patient population may be due to later presentation of NSCLC, or lower referral to, or suitability for, curative resection.

The Committee noted that there are currently no funded targeted options for adjuvant therapy following resection of EGFRm positive NSCLC, and that patients currently receive platinum-based chemotherapy if deemed necessary or appropriate following surgery, followed by docetaxel upon progression. The Committee noted that if osimertinib were offered as adjuvant treatment, this would be as monotherapy, as there is no evidence that using it in combination with chemotherapy provides additional benefit. The Committee noted that the 2021 Te Aho o Te Kahu report indicated that of those diagnosed with NSCLC, systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 32.0% of M\u0101ori patients, 37.7% of Pacific patients, 42.4% of Asian patients, and 27.0% of NZ European/Other patients.

The Committee noted that osimertinib for the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC following resection has been recommended by health technology assessment agencies in Canada (<a href=\"https://cadth.ca/sites/default/files/DRR/2022/PC0246-Tagrisso-rec%20Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CADTH</a>), Scotland (<a href=\"https://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/medicines-advice/osimertinib-tagrisso-full-smc2383/\" target=\"_blank\">SMC</a>) and England/Wales (<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta761\" target=\"_blank\">NICE</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III ADAURA trial, which provided the key evidence for the use of osimertinib as adjuvant treatment following resection of EGFR-positive NSCLC (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32955177/\" target=\"_blank\">Wu et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;282:1711-23</a>). The Committee noted that patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either osimertinib 80 mg once daily (n=339) or placebo (n=343) for three years. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was disease-free survival in stage II to IIIA NSCLC, and that the secondary endpoint was disease-free survival in stage IB to IIIA patients.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.15.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the stage II-IIIA patients had a disease-free survival at 24 months of 90% with osimertinib (95% CI 84 to 93) compared to 44% with placebo (95% CI 37 to 51), with a hazard ratio (HR) for recurrence or death of 0.17 (99.06% CI 0.11 to 0.26). The Committee noted that for the overall population the disease-free survival at 24 months was 89% in the osimertinib group (95% CI 85 to 92) compared to 52% with placebo (95% CI 46 to 58), with an HR for recurrence or death of 0.20 (99.12% CI 0.14 to 0.30). The Committee noted that the overall survival data for the ADAURA trial was immature, but that double the number of patients in the placebo arm compared to the osimertinib treatment arm had died at 24 months. The Committee also noted that there were no new safety concerns reported.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.15.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that subgroup analysis reported that all subgroups favoured osimertinib for HRs for disease recurrence or death, including disease stage, EGFR mutation, age, and race. The Committee also noted that the probability of CNS disease-free survival was significantly better for the osimertinib treated group compared to the placebo group (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.33). The Committee considered it was unclear how the CNS disease-free survival affected the overall survival but considered that any impact on CNS disease free survival was important. The Committee noted that osimertinib is known to have better blood-brain-barrier penetration than other TKIs. The Committee noted that osimertinib had a higher incidence of grade three adverse events compared to placebo but considered that these were all in the scope of general oncological practice.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted separately published health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results from the ADAURA trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35012927/\" target=\"_blank\">Majem et al.

The Committee noted that HRQoL was measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, then every 24 weeks until recurrence or treatment completion/discontinuation. The Committee noted that there were no clinically meaningful differences in HRQoL reported between treatment arms. The Committee noted that the time to deterioration for both mental and physical in the HRQoL study was the same between treatment arms and considered that this reflected patients\u2019 relatively good health status at early-stage disease. The Committee noted that patients in the placebo group were switched to the osimertinib treatment arm upon recurrence and considered that this may be why the HRQoL results between the groups were so similar. The Committee considered that the effect of patients crossing treatment groups may also affected the overall survival results in ADAURA.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the quality of the ADAURA trial was good but noted that the overall survival data was immature and did not indicate a strong overall survival benefit to date, noting also the potential effects of patient cross-over on the results.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is evidence for the use of first and second generation TKIs in the adjuvant treatment setting, which shows in general a significant benefit of TKIs versus chemotherapy with regard to disease-free survival, but generally no significant benefit in overall survival if any.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">1.18.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The EVAN trial (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30150014/\" target=\"_blank\">Yue et al.
