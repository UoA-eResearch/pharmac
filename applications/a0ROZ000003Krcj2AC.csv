The majority of diagnoses are for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), a form of exocrine tumour, which accounts for approximately 90% of all pancreatic cancer diagnoses (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6688256/"" target=""_blank"">Orth et al, Radiat Oncol. 2019;14:141</a>), with other subtypes including acinar carcinoma, pancreaticoblastoma, and neuroendocrine tumours (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547082/"" target=""_blank"">Park et al, JAMA. 2021;326:851-62</a>).</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that at presentation, 50% of affected individuals have metastatic disease, whilst 10% to 15% have localised disease amenable to surgery, and the remainder (30%-35%) have locally advanced mostly unresectable disease due to the extent of tumour-vascular involvement (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547082/"" target=""_blank"">Park et al, 2021</a>). </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that pancreatic cancer has a very poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately 10 to 12 months with treatment, and 5 to 6 months without treatment due to the advanced stage of diagnosis for many at presentation, and the low percentage of those affected eligible for surgical resection (<a href=""https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(22)00356-0/pdf"" target=""_blank"">Wood et al, Gastroenterology 2022;163:386–402</a>). </p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the risk of developing pancreatic cancer is correlated with age, with approximately 80% of those with pancreatic cancer aged over 60 years and the average age at diagnosis being 71 years of age (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502190/"" target=""_blank"">Mario et al, Acta Biomed. 2018; 89: 141-6</a>). </p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted pancreatic cancer is reported to have a 5-year prevalence of 10.87 per 10,000 in New Zealand (<a href=""https://gco.iarc.fr/today/data/factsheets/populations/554-new-zealand-fact-sheets.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The Global Cancer observatory, 2021</a>).

The 5-year overall survival was reported to be higher in those with mis-match repair deficiency compared to general population survival times at 13.6% versus &lt;8% respectively.
