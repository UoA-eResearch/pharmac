The Subcommittee noted that it had previously estimated about 80% of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma being cured by first-line chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-minutes-2018-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>CaTSoP 2018</b></a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.2.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients with transplant-eligible Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, refractory to first-line treatment or relapsing after first line therapy undergo salvage chemotherapy, which aims to achieve a complete response with as few different chemotherapy regimens as possible before proceeding to autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that achieving a complete response with the minimal number of chemotherapy regimen changes, and successful stem cell collection (requiring patients to undergo collection only once), both convey clinically important benefits to the patient and may avoid additional costs (eg. additional stem cell collections and additional imaging).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the preferred first-line salvage chemotherapy regimen for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma varies around the country and noted that there is not a clear single standard salvage regime that is recommended internationally. The Subcommittee noted that Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma may respond to many regimens. The Subcommittee considered that ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) would be a reasonable first-line salvage chemotherapy comparator for the majority of patients in New Zealand with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma for cost-effectiveness assessment, as it is used for about two-thirds of patients in this setting in New Zealand, with the remaining proportion having a comparator equally split between DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin) or IGEV (ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that all patients who receive standard-of-care salvage chemotherapy for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and that mesna is used for patients who receive intravenous ifosfamide.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that publicly funded positron emission tomography (PET) scans are performed at disease relapse, and to assess response to first line salvage chemotherapy, and may be additionally performed to assess response in a patient for whom first line salvage treatment does not provide an optimal response and needs to proceed to second line salvage. The Subcommittee noted there is evidence indicating that metabolic complete response assessed by PET scan in patients who received a salvage regimen on relapse or for refractory disease, ie. PET negative pretransplant, conveys a reduced risk of relapse (~20%) compared with a PET positive scan result which is associated with ~50% risk of relapse (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819743/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Adams et al.

The Subcommittee noted a published comparison of response rates and adverse events of older regimens (eg DHAP, ICE) and newer regimens (eg IGEV, BeGeV) and that this indicated a trend of improved remission rate with newer regimens IGEV and BeGeV, however, this was limited by the single-arm trial data (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjh.15639\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Broccoli et al. 2019</b></a>). The Subcommittee noted that, compared with other salvage regimens such as ICE chemotherapy, fewer red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be required with BeGeV or IGEV but it was very difficult to quantify any differences because of the quality of data and slightly different reporting methodology (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.10661\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Santoro et al. 2007</b></a>).

The Subcommittee considered that a one-hour decrease in infusion time could make a meaningful difference for treatment centres (eg allowing for an additional patient to receive a 30-minute intravenous infusion) and noted that in some centres, patients may be admitted for up to three days for ICE to be administered. However, the Subcommittee considered that the day ward requirements of both regimens would be similar, given that ICE requires 3 days of lengthy infusions, while BEGEV requires four days of shorter infusion times.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the cost of bendamustine was less than the cost of a many other agents considered for the treatment of malignancy.

Therefore, the Subcommittee considered that lack of Medsafe approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was not of concern.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the key evidence for bendamustine as part of the BeGeV regimen comes from a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm phase II study conducted at 10 centres in Italy, which recruited 59 transplant-eligible patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma that was refractory to or had relapsed after one previous chemotherapy line(<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27382096/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Santoro et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the study publication described BeGeV as a second-line salvage chemotherapy, however, this was interpreted to refer to the first salvage chemotherapy (ie second-line chemotherapy). The Subcommittee considered that in New Zealand BEACOPP is generally used in high-risk patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients were generally young (median 33 years of age), were candidates for transplant up to the age of 70 years, almost half had primary refractory disease, and many had a complete response lasting less than one year; overall, the Subcommittee considered this was a high-risk patient group who were representative of the New Zealand patient population.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients received BeGeV (gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4, vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 on day 1, and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3) for four cycles every 21 days as induction therapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT); then patients with complete or partial response received myeloablative therapy and then reinfusion of mobilised CD34+ stem cells.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that after 4 cycles of BeGEV, 73% of patients (N=43) in the intention-to-treat population achieved a metabolic complete response on PET scan and 10% (N=6) achieved a partial response, with more patients with relapsed disease achieving complete response than patients with refractory disease, and most patients proceeded to autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 62.2% and two-year overall survival (OS) rate was 77.6%, with comparable results for patients with relapsed and refractory disease. The Subcommittee noted that PFS was higher at about 80% in patients who actually received an autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the adverse events profile of BeGeV was manageable and identified no major concerns, however, the risk of febrile neutropenia (grade 3-4 N=7, 12%) or infection (grade 3-4 N=4, 7%) was not well described and it was unclear whether patients were hospitalised eg for intravenous antibiotics. The Subcommittee noted that red blood cell and platelet transfusions were required for 8 (14%) and 3 patients (5%), respectively.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that stem cells were successfully mobilised in 57 of 59 patients, with successful collection reported in 55 patients (96.5%), of which 42 patients (76%) only needed one collection. The Subcommittee considered this was a very high success rate with high yield and rapid engraftment reported post-transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the updated study results published in 2020 reported data for a reasonable proportion of patients out to five years of follow-up with 5-year PFS and OS of 59% and 78%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population and PFS and OS in patients who received an autologous stem cell transplant of 77% and 91%, respectively (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31935284/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Santoro et al. Blood Adv. 2020;4:136-140</b></a>). The Subcommittee considered that these long-term outcomes suggested persistent PFS and OS results in the overall intention-to-treat population without relapse over time, and indicated very good PFS and OS results for those patients who received an autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the BeGeV regimen is an evolution of the IGEV regimen published by the same primary author (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.10661\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Santoro et al. Haematologica. 2007;92:35-41</b></a>) and considered that the study designs were the same, providing support for the strength and comparability of the BeGeV evidence. The Subcommittee noted a published comparison of response rates and adverse events of older regimens (eg DHAP, ICE) and newer regimens (eg IGEV, BeGeV) and that this indicated a trend of improved remission rate with newer regimens IGEV and BeGeV, however, this was limited by the single-arm trial data (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjh.15639\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Broccoli et al. 2019</b></a>). The Subcommittee noted that, compared with other salvage regimens such as ICE chemotherapy, fewer red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be required with BeGeV or IGEV but it was very difficult to quantify any differences because of the quality of data and slightly different reporting methodology (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.10661\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Santoro et al. 2007</b></a>).

The Subcommittee noted that there was no evidence of a quality of life benefit from treatment with bendamustine as part of the BeGeV regimen and considered that evidence for quality of life was not expected to become available in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.22.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that further evidence from multi-centre trials (eg a randomised controlled trial comparing BeGeV to ICE or another regimen) would not be expected in this setting, due to changes in international standard of care treatment for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.23.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the intravenous administration (ie chair time) of BeGeV would be approximately two hours, which is less than that required of a comparator regimen such as ICE which is approximately 3.5 to 4 hours. The Subcommittee considered that a one-hour decrease in infusion time could make a meaningful difference for treatment centres (eg allowing for an additional patient to receive a 30-minute intravenous infusion) and noted that in some centres, patients may be admitted for up to three days for ICE to be administered. However, the Subcommittee considered that the day ward requirements of both regimens would be similar, given that ICE requires 3 days of lengthy infusions, while BEGEV requires four days of shorter infusion times.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.24.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the cost of bendamustine was less than the cost of a many other agents considered for the treatment of malignancy. The Subcommittee considered that, if bendamustine were funded for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, it would be used to prepare patients for autologous stem cell transplant and may be used for approximately 11 patients per year.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.25.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that uptake of BeGeV could vary across centres in New Zealand due to the treatment schedule requiring treatment to be given over four days for four cycles, if bendamustine were funded for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and noted that this was an increase from ICE which requires three days of treatment for three cycles. Members considered that an extra day of treatment would increase costs, particularly for rural patients being treated at regional cancer centres who may need accommodation for an extra night.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.26.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that treatment with BeGeV may require fewer PET scans than other regimens if PET negativity is detected on the first PET scan after a patient\u2019s first salvage regimen treatment, prior to autologous stem cell transplant. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence did not compare BeGeV to standard of care regimens directly, however, an appropriate comparison of response rates and adverse events of older regimens and newer regimens was presented by <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjh.15639\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Broccoli et al. 2019</b></a>.
