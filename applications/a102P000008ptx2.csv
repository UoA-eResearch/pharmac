The Committee considered that current accepted care for patients whose stage III melanoma has been completely resected is observation only, by skin examination by a medical practitioner with or without ultrasound/radiological assessments. The Committee noted that the type and frequency of radiological assessments (including PET-CT) for surveillance varies between centres, and that use of MRI/CT/PET-CT is influenced by geographic location and access e.g. in the private setting. </p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that treatment for patients with unresectable or high-risk (stage IV) melanoma includes systemic e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy; or local therapies; e.g. radiotherapy, surgery, which are also given in different settings e.g. adjuvant, neoadjuvant, palliative.\xa0</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy may be used internationally and in clinical trials for adjuvant treatment of melanoma, intended to reduce the risk of relapse and progression to metastatic disease. The Committee considered that adjuvant therapies are not widely used in New Zealand for resected stage III melanoma and that adjuvant interferon-alpha 2b (which is not funded in New Zealand) can lead to considerable toxicity with only a small benefit in overall survival.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase III CheckMate 238 trial of adjuvant nivolumab compared with ipilimumab in 906 patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma, which reports 1-year RFS of 60.8% with ipilimumab and 70.5% with nivolumab (HR 0.65; 97.56% CI: 0.51 to 0.83; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891423"" target=""_blank"">Weber et al.

Members considered that the trial had certainty of staging due to complete lymphadenectomies and pathological staging with AJCC 7<sup>th</sup> Edition, compared to future trials which would be more reliant on radiological staging with AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition. The Committee considered the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were relevant to New Zealand patients except few New Zealand patients may now have complete lymph node dissections in standard care.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the median RFS of the KeyNote-054 intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint, was not reached and so not able to be estimated, with pembrolizumab compared to 20.4 months with placebo (95% CI: 16.2 to not estimable). The Committee noted one-year RFS was 75.4% with pembrolizumab compared to 61.0% with placebo: HR 0.57, 98.4% CI: 0.43 to 0.74, P&lt;0.001.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there was little difference in RFS between patients with PD-L1 positive tumour status (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.69, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and PD-L1 negative tumour status (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.85, <i>P</i>=0.01) who received pembrolizumab in the KeyNote-054 clinical trial.

The Committee considered the quality of life benefits of adjuvant pembrolizumab were uncertain, given that patients with resected stage III melanoma are generally asymptomatic.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the median duration of KeyNote-054 trial treatment was 12 months (15.1 months median follow up) and similar proportions of patients completed the treatment regimen in each group, however, 13.8% of pembrolizumab patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity and 35.7% of placebo patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression. The Committee noted that grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in a higher proportion of patients who received pembrolizumab (14.7%), including 1 treatment-related death, than placebo (3.4%).</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adjuvant pembrolizumab conveys significantly more adverse effects for patients with resected stage III melanoma, including the risk of a significant adverse reaction to immunotherapy. The Committee considered that grade 4 or 5 serious adverse events can be difficult to manage and require hospitalisation, multidisciplinary care and additional treatments e.g. steroids, infliximab. </p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a subsequent publication which assessed the prognostic and predictive values of AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging on the KeyNote-054 trial patient cohort, reporting 1-year RFS in stage IIIA, IIB, IIIC and IIID of 92.7%, 79.0%, 73.6% and 50.0% respectively (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200321"" target=""_blank"">Eggermont et al. Eur J Cancer. 2019: 116;148-57</a>). The Committee considered that AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging was strongly associated with RFS but did not have predictive importance for the treatment comparison in regard to RFS (<i>P</i> = 0.68). </p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is limited data for the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab, but since there may be a higher risk of relapse in the first 2-3 years, early treatment of patients diagnosed with stage IIIB melanoma or higher may be more suitable. However, the Committee considered that there is no evidence for whether the OS benefit would be greater with adjuvant pembrolizumab for stage III disease compared to treatment with pembrolizumab in the unresectable stage IV setting that is currently funded.</p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the KeyNote-054 trial did not provide data for OS, sequencing of treatment, or evidence of benefit from further pembrolizumab treatment after relapse. The Committee considered that the relevance of the primary trial endpoint (RFS) and the external validity of the KeyNote-054 trial remained uncertain, although the individual trial was of high quality. The Committee noted that data collection is ongoing to address the secondary endpoints of the KeyNote-054 trial including distant metastasis-free survival, OS, safety measures, and measures of health-related quality of life.</p><p><i style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Recurrence-free survival as a surrogate outcome for overall survival </i></p><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the results of a meta-analysis which included a total of about 5,000 patients with stage II or III melanoma from 11 studies comparing interferon to observation, and 1 study of interferon compared to vaccination (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922786"" target=""_blank"">Suciu et al.

The Committee considered that all studies used in the meta-analysis (published in 2010 to 2013) would have recruited participants before immunotherapy was widely used and therefore do not reflect current melanoma treatment paradigms, which presented challenges for validating this prediction.</p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there is currently insufficient survival data to inform assessments of whether RFS is an appropriate surrogate outcome for OS in resected stage III melanoma, but given data collection from KeyNote-054 is ongoing, that OS data would likely be available ahead of sufficient data to assess RFS as a surrogate.</p><p><i style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Pembrolizumab re-treatment</i></p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that both the relapse rate at 18 months from the start of adjuvant pembrolizumab, and the optimal duration of treatment for stage III melanoma, is yet to be identified.

The Subcommittee noted that early discontinuation occurred in 61% of participants primarily in the first three months due to either progression and/or toxicity; discontinuations at nine to 12 months were primarily due to patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment. The Subcommittee noted explanation for patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment was not provided, although members considered that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in discontinuations. The Subcommittee considered that this patient population was slightly different to the New Zealand patient population with resected stage III melanoma in terms of risk profile (eg lesion resectability, grade and Breslow score), however, considered that the evidence provided evidence of higher toxicity, greater discontinuation rates but similar recurrence rates to those reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>8.22<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that different surrogate endpoints for survival were reported in melanoma trials.

The Subcommittee noted that early discontinuation occurred in 61% of participants primarily in the first three months due to either progression and/or toxicity; discontinuations at nine to 12 months were primarily due to patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment. The Subcommittee noted explanation for patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment was not provided, although members considered that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in discontinuations. The Subcommittee considered that this patient population was slightly different to the New Zealand patient population with resected stage III melanoma in terms of risk profile (eg lesion resectability, grade and Breslow score), however, considered that the evidence provided evidence of higher toxicity, greater discontinuation rates but similar recurrence rates to those reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>8.22<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that different surrogate endpoints for survival were reported in melanoma trials.

The Subcommittee considered that there were many contributing factors including the length of follow-up and resulting hazard ratio, and the differences between populations (noting that the forest plots appeared quite consistent but there were differences between patient populations). The Subcommittee considered that there was some evidence of a reasonable correlation between PFS and OS in melanoma, however, no strong data existed for disease-free survival (DFS) or RFS as a surrogate for improved OS. The Subcommittee considered that an association between RFS and OS was theoretical and therefore an OS benefit from increased RFS could not be assumed in cost-effectiveness modelling, however, acknowledged that there could be a moderate correlation between RFS and OS.</p><p>8.23<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence from a systematic review and network meta-analysis of adjuvant immunotherapy in stages IIC to stage IV melanoma, with regimens including ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, nivolumab/ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib/trametinib (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33680957/"" target=""_blank"">Christofyllakis et al.

<li>Choices &ndash; due to scarce resources, decisions must be made about how best to use them.</li>
