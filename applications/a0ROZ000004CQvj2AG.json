PTAC considered that the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors were limited, and that there is insufficient evidence of benefit (beyond a reduction of time to alleviation of symptoms) to recommend wider funding. PTAC had recommended that funding be limiting to hospitalised patients who are likely to have more severe forms of influenza and/or are at high risk of influenza complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that between 2015 and 2017 there was an average of 11 outbreaks of influenza in LTCFs per year reported by ESR, with an average of 240 cases per year associated with these outbreaks. The Subcommittee noted applicant estimations that 649 residents would be treated per annum if oseltamivir was funded in this treatment setting. Members considered that if funding was included for this patient group there would likely be much higher patient numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that patients in LTCFs have a high health need as they are more frail that similarly aged patients in the community. Members also considered that influenza vaccination rates are high, however the protective effect of the vaccine is likely to be less than that seen in community dwelling elderly of similar age. Members also noted that due to communal living they are at risk of influenza spread within the facility. Members considered that the application did not consider whether or not a LTCF practises disease control and prevention during outbreaks, or whether prophylaxis would be based on a patient\u2019s immunisation status.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered whether Maori or Pacific Island people are at an increased risk of complication in nursing homes due to influenza infection. Members noted that Maori and Pacific people are less likely to dwell with in LTCF. In 2013, 32,000 people lived in LTCF for older people across 822 facilities; 68.1% of those were female and 92.5% were of European ethnicity (Maori 3.3%, Pacific Island 1.5%), 75% of the residents were over 80 years of age.

The only Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) that have been undertaken specifically in the elderly were WV15819, WV15876 and WV15978 which had been considered by PTAC in 2013. Members noted that these studies had not shown a significant difference between oseltamivir and placebo with respect to time to alleviate symptoms or hospitalisations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, from a prophylaxis perspective, there are no level 1 (RCT) studies. The only RCT provided in this setting considered Dutch nursing homes during four influenza seasons between 2009-2013. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-7622-11-13\" target=\"_blank\">Van der Sande et al. Emerging themes in Epidemiology, 2014; 11:13</a>) Members noted that of the 42 nursing homes recruited 15 outbreaks were included in the analysis which failed to find statistic significant of a protective effect, Members noted that the low outbreak numbers negatively impacted the power of the study. Members also noted that there were logistic challenges in ensuring the timely administration of prophylaxis. The Subcommittee considered this was relevant to the New Zealand setting and questioned whether prophylaxis could be given in a timely fashion if oseltamivir was funded in this patient group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a cluster RCT (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046509\" target=\"_blank\">Booy et al. PLoS one, 2012; 7(10): e46509</a>) which considered 16 aged care facilities randomly assigned treatment \u201cT\u201d (oseltamivir treatment 75 mg twice daily for five days) or treatment and prophylaxis \u201cT&amp;P\u201d (oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 10 days), the primary outcome being the attack rate of influenza like illness. The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed influenza case on residents between the two arms was not significant (p=0.4).\u00a0There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T= 24 days, T&amp;P=11 days p=0.04).\u00a0There was a non-significant reduction in deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia in the T&amp;P group. The Subcommittee noted the low power of the study which was a result of low number of influenza outbreaks during the reported period.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.115\" target=\"_blank\">Singh et al. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 2018; 39(8): 955-60</a>. A retrospective observation study which analysed 53 H3N2 out breaks during 2014-2015 in LTCFs in Manitoba, Canada. This study looked at secondary attack rate in relationship to timing of oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. The study observed that delay of oseltamivir was associated with increased odds of infection on both univariate (P&lt;0.0001) and multivariable analyses (p&lt;0.001)</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is no RCT evidence that hospitalisation rates would be reduced given the lack of level 1 evidence for efficacy of treatment in the elderly and the lack evidence for efficacy of prophylaxis in LTCF. The Subcommittee further considered that all other (non-RCT) evidence is noncontrolled observational data.\u00a0This data suggests that LTCF outbreaks may terminate quicker if prophylaxis is provided in a timely fashion, but does not address the hard endpoint of morbidity, hospitalisation or deaths.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee concluded that the only rationale for funding in this setting would be on the basis that international guidelines on LTCF antiviral treatments have recommended providing treatment and prophylaxis despite the poor evidence base. The Subcommittee noted that many statements in the guidelines that recommend treatment do not cite any supporting evidence or acknowledge that the evidence base is light and more studies are required. Members considered that in New Zealand, medicines of modest benefit with a poor evidence base that have a significant budget impact are difficult to justify funding ahead of better investments.</p>",

The only Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) that have been undertaken specifically in the elderly were WV15819, WV15876 and WV15978 which had been considered by PTAC in 2013. Members noted that these studies had not shown a significant difference between oseltamivir and placebo with respect to time to alleviate symptoms or hospitalisations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, from a prophylaxis perspective, there are no level 1 (RCT) studies. The only RCT provided in this setting considered Dutch nursing homes during four influenza seasons between 2009-2013. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-7622-11-13\" target=\"_blank\">Van der Sande et al. Emerging themes in Epidemiology, 2014; 11:13</a>) Members noted that of the 42 nursing homes recruited 15 outbreaks were included in the analysis which failed to find statistic significant of a protective effect, Members noted that the low outbreak numbers negatively impacted the power of the study. Members also noted that there were logistic challenges in ensuring the timely administration of prophylaxis. The Subcommittee considered this was relevant to the New Zealand setting and questioned whether prophylaxis could be given in a timely fashion if oseltamivir was funded in this patient group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a cluster RCT (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046509\" target=\"_blank\">Booy et al. PLoS one, 2012; 7(10): e46509</a>) which considered 16 aged care facilities randomly assigned treatment \u201cT\u201d (oseltamivir treatment 75 mg twice daily for five days) or treatment and prophylaxis \u201cT&amp;P\u201d (oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 10 days), the primary outcome being the attack rate of influenza like illness. The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed influenza case on residents between the two arms was not significant (p=0.4).\u00a0There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T= 24 days, T&amp;P=11 days p=0.04).\u00a0There was a non-significant reduction in deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia in the T&amp;P group. The Subcommittee noted the low power of the study which was a result of low number of influenza outbreaks during the reported period.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.115\" target=\"_blank\">Singh et al. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 2018; 39(8): 955-60</a>. A retrospective observation study which analysed 53 H3N2 out breaks during 2014-2015 in LTCFs in Manitoba, Canada. This study looked at secondary attack rate in relationship to timing of oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. The study observed that delay of oseltamivir was associated with increased odds of infection on both univariate (P&lt;0.0001) and multivariable analyses (p&lt;0.001)</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is no RCT evidence that hospitalisation rates would be reduced given the lack of level 1 evidence for efficacy of treatment in the elderly and the lack evidence for efficacy of prophylaxis in LTCF. The Subcommittee further considered that all other (non-RCT) evidence is noncontrolled observational data.\u00a0This data suggests that LTCF outbreaks may terminate quicker if prophylaxis is provided in a timely fashion, but does not address the hard endpoint of morbidity, hospitalisation or deaths.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee concluded that the only rationale for funding in this setting would be on the basis that international guidelines on LTCF antiviral treatments have recommended providing treatment and prophylaxis despite the poor evidence base. The Subcommittee noted that many statements in the guidelines that recommend treatment do not cite any supporting evidence or acknowledge that the evidence base is light and more studies are required. Members considered that in New Zealand, medicines of modest benefit with a poor evidence base that have a significant budget impact are difficult to justify funding ahead of better investments.</p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2013-02.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February 2013</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2013-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">May 2013</a> PTAC considered the role of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) including use in high risk patients. PTAC considered that the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors were limited, and that there is insufficient evidence of benefit (beyond a reduction of time to alleviation of symptoms) to recommend wider funding. PTAC had recommended that funding be limiting to hospitalised patients who are likely to have more severe forms of influenza and/or are at high risk of influenza complications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that between 2015 and 2017 there was an average of 11 outbreaks of influenza in LTCFs per year reported by ESR, with an average of 240 cases per year associated with these outbreaks. The Subcommittee noted applicant estimations that 649 residents would be treated per annum if oseltamivir was funded in this treatment setting. Members considered that if funding was included for this patient group there would likely be much higher patient numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that patients in LTCFs have a high health need as they are more frail that similarly aged patients in the community. Members also considered that influenza vaccination rates are high, however the protective effect of the vaccine is likely to be less than that seen in community dwelling elderly of similar age. Members also noted that due to communal living they are at risk of influenza spread within the facility. Members considered that the application did not consider whether or not a LTCF practises disease control and prevention during outbreaks, or whether prophylaxis would be based on a patient\u2019s immunisation status.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered whether Maori or Pacific Island people are at an increased risk of complication in nursing homes due to influenza infection. Members noted that Maori and Pacific people are less likely to dwell with in LTCF. In 2013, 32,000 people lived in LTCF for older people across 822 facilities; 68.1% of those were female and 92.5% were of European ethnicity (Maori 3.3%, Pacific Island 1.5%), 75% of the residents were over 80 years of age. The Subcommittee considered that Maori and Pacific people are less represented in LTCF population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the purpose of making oseltamivir available for treatment and prophylaxis is to reduce the morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza. Members noted that vaccination, infection control activities (e.g. isolation and prevention of cross infection) and GP care with provision of antibiotics for influenza complications are available within LTCFs. Members noted that oseltamivir is the current preferred antiviral option recommended in guidelines from overseas jurisdictions\u2019 review of the literature.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted the following publications:</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%E2%80%A2%09Peters%2C+P.H.%2C+et+al.%2C++Journal+of+the+American+Geriatrics+Society%2C+2001.+49(8)%3A+p.+1025-1031\" target=\"_blank\">Peters et al.

Emerging themes in Epidemiology, 2014; 11:13</a>) Members noted that of the 42 nursing homes recruited 15 outbreaks were included in the analysis which failed to find statistic significant of a protective effect, Members noted that the low outbreak numbers negatively impacted the power of the study. Members also noted that there were logistic challenges in ensuring the timely administration of prophylaxis. The Subcommittee considered this was relevant to the New Zealand setting and questioned whether prophylaxis could be given in a timely fashion if oseltamivir was funded in this patient group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a cluster RCT (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046509\" target=\"_blank\">Booy et al. PLoS one, 2012; 7(10): e46509</a>) which considered 16 aged care facilities randomly assigned treatment \u201cT\u201d (oseltamivir treatment 75 mg twice daily for five days) or treatment and prophylaxis \u201cT&amp;P\u201d (oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 10 days), the primary outcome being the attack rate of influenza like illness. The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed influenza case on residents between the two arms was not significant (p=0.4).\u00a0There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T= 24 days, T&amp;P=11 days p=0.04).\u00a0There was a non-significant reduction in deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia in the T&amp;P group. The Subcommittee noted the low power of the study which was a result of low number of influenza outbreaks during the reported period.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.115\" target=\"_blank\">Singh et al. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 2018; 39(8): 955-60</a>. A retrospective observation study which analysed 53 H3N2 out breaks during 2014-2015 in LTCFs in Manitoba, Canada. This study looked at secondary attack rate in relationship to timing of oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. The study observed that delay of oseltamivir was associated with increased odds of infection on both univariate (P&lt;0.0001) and multivariable analyses (p&lt;0.001)</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that there is no RCT evidence that hospitalisation rates would be reduced given the lack of level 1 evidence for efficacy of treatment in the elderly and the lack evidence for efficacy of prophylaxis in LTCF. The Subcommittee further considered that all other (non-RCT) evidence is noncontrolled observational data.\u00a0This data suggests that LTCF outbreaks may terminate quicker if prophylaxis is provided in a timely fashion, but does not address the hard endpoint of morbidity, hospitalisation or deaths.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee concluded that the only rationale for funding in this setting would be on the basis that international guidelines on LTCF antiviral treatments have recommended providing treatment and prophylaxis despite the poor evidence base. The Subcommittee noted that many statements in the guidelines that recommend treatment do not cite any supporting evidence or acknowledge that the evidence base is light and more studies are required. Members considered that in New Zealand, medicines of modest benefit with a poor evidence base that have a significant budget impact are difficult to justify funding ahead of better investments.</p>",
