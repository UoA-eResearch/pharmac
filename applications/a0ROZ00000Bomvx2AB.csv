The Committee also noted that transient ischemic event (TIA) is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke and may only last up to a few hours. The Committee noted that the ABCD2 score is a risk assessment tool designed to improve the prediction of short-term stroke risk after a TIA and that those with TIA considered to be at a high risk of stroke will have an ABCD2 score of 4 or higher.

The Committee also noted a 2022 study of inequities in stroke care access in New Zealand which reported that non-Europeans were less likely to achieve functional independence up to 12 months after suffering a stroke (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35036976/"" target=""_blank"">Thompson et al.

The Committee noted that although treatment with clopidogrel is effective over aspirin alone in patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA, patients must have a functioning CYP2C19 gene for clopidogrel to be correctly transformed into its active metabolite and that those without correctly functioning CYP2C19 will not derive the same benefit from clopidogrel as those without mutations in this gene.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the benefit of dual therapy over clopidogrel treatment alone is likely to be small.
