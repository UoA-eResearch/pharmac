          "s": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that a urinary tract infection (UTI) is either an infection of the bladder and lower urinary tract (cystitis) or an infection of the kidney and upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis), and that most UTIs are due to colonisation by pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that UTIs are classified as uncomplicated if there is no functional or anatomical abnormality in the urinary tract, no evidence of pyelonephritis, no renal functional impairment, and no concomitant condition that would promote a UTI. The Subcommittee noted that, if an uncomplicated UTI is left untreated, complications such as pyelonephritis, kidney damage, bacteraemia, and sepsis can develop.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of uncomplicated UTIs is very high, although most cases are mild and some require symptom management alone. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 200,000 patients each year are treated with funded antimicrobial agents for uncomplicated UTI according to community pharmacy claim data. The Subcommittee considered it was difficult to determine what proportion of antimicrobial agent use is for treatment of uncomplicated UTI (compared to prophylaxis).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of uncomplicated UTI is much higher in women and would account for more than 80% of cases. The Subcommittee noted that a UTI occurring in pregnancy is a complicated UTI and that treatment of complicated UTIs is outside the requested indication for this application.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that uncomplicated UTIs do not disproportionately affect M\u0101ori or Pacific people. The Subcommittee considered that patients with lower socio-economic status may have an increased risk of complications if they have difficulties in accessing healthcare.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that New Zealand adult patient with uncomplicated UTIs due to E. coli would receive treatment with either trimethoprim (between 65% and 70% of cases), nitrofurantoin (30% of cases) or cefalexin (less than 5% of cases). The Subcommittee considered that other agents such as quinolones or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid may be used for first-line treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in a small number of cases and co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, or cefaclor were commonly used in young children (syrup formulations) with nitrofurantoin increasingly being required due to resistance. The Subcommittee considered that standard of care second-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs in New Zealand adults would be with nitrofurantoin (if not used first-line) rather than with norfloxacin.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the 2017 Canterbury Antimicrobial Susceptibility Report demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance (predominantly of E. coli) is climbing but has been relatively stable since 2009, reporting resistance rates in Canterbury of around 25% to trimethoprim and 4% to nitrofurantoin. Members considered that resistance to fosfomycin, which is currently used in New Zealand under Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981, is approximately 2%. The Subcommittee considered that rates of resistance vary, and noted that Erdem et al. (J Glob Infect Dis. 2018:10;129-32) report E. coli resistance rates of almost 14% to fosfomycin and about 18% to nitrofurantoin in Turkey.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that 2% of patients would be intolerant of antibiotics (based on withdrawal rates in clinical trials), and that there would be a small proportion of female patients with poor renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of less than 60 ml per minute) for whom nitrofurantoin would be contraindicated.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a need for another treatment option after trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for multi-drug resistant E. coli. The Subcommittee considered that women with uncomplicated UTI due to multi-drug resistant E. coli have a high health need.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application is for fosfomycin trometamol (herein referred to as fosfomycin), a broad-spectrum antibiotic which inhibits the first stage of bacterial wall synthesis and is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee considered that although the mechanism of action of fosfomycin is different to that of currently funded agents used for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, fosfomycin would be used for the same indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is supplied as powder in a 3g sachet, to be dissolved and taken as a stat dose on an empty stomach. The Subcommittee noted that males would require an additional dose on day four.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is not registered for use in New Zealand, however, District Health Board Hospitals have been sourcing fosfomycin under Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981. The Subcommittee noted that Te Arai BioFarma Ltd submitted an application for registration of fosfomycin to Medsafe in February 2018, and evaluation is underway. The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is listed on the Hospital Medicines List (HML) and a proposal for fosfomycin is currently ranked on PHARMACs Options for Investment list (with use restricted to treatment of patients with acute symptomatic bacteriologically-proven lower UTIs and with proven resistance or contraindication to all other oral antibiotics including nitrofurantoin, on the recommendation of an Infectious Disease physician or Clinical Microbiologist).</p><p>\t</p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised MON-US-03 clinical trial which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of treatment with nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated lower UTIs predominantly due to E. coli in 749 females (Stein et al. Clin Therap. 1999;21:1864-1872). The Subcommittee noted that the 1-week and 4 to 6-week post-treatment cure rates were 87% and 96% respectively for fosfomycin compared to 81% and 91% respectively for nitrofurantoin, although these did not reach statistical significance.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the overall clinical success rate for cure and improvement reported by Stein et al. was 80% in both treatment groups, and that the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar with 5.3% of patients in the fosfomycin group and 5.6% in the nitrofurantoin group reporting AEs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial of a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of nitrofurantoin 50 mg four times daily used as first-line treatment in 231 patients with symptoms of acute dysuria, stranguria and/or urinary frequency (van Pienbroek et al. Pharm World Sci. 1993;15:257-262). The Subcommittee noted that the day 9 cure rates were 81% for fosfomycin compared to 90% for nitrofurantoin, and that overall efficacy (symptoms and dipslide results) at day 42 were 88% in the fosfomycin group compared to 85% in the nitrofurantoin group although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted van Pienbroek et al. reported a large proportion of patient withdrawals due to AEs occurring by day 9, with 14 of patients withdrawn from the fosfomycin group compared to 4 from the nitrofurantoin group (P=0.015). The Subcommittee noted that AEs were primarily gastrointestinal (GI) and were greater at both day 4 and day 9 in the fosfomycin group than the nitrofurantoin group, but the statistical significance of these results was not reported. The Subcommittee noted that there were no withdrawals due to AEs in the nitrofurantoin group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a randomised (2:1) comparative study which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 5 days of treatment with trimethoprim 300 mg daily in 300 female patients between 18 and 65 years of age with uncomplicated UTIs predominantly due to E. coli (Minassian et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 1998;10:39-47). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported microbiological cure rates at day 7-9 of 83.3% in the fosfomycin group compared to 83% in the trimethoprim group, and infection persisted after treatment in about 17% of patients in each group, although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant. The Subcommittee noted that no safety data was reported.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following additional evidence for fosfomycin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, including meta-analyses, reviews and international guidelines:</p><p>\u2022\tFalagas et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:1862-77.</p><p>\u2022\tGrigoryan et al. JAMA. 2014;312:1677-84.</p><p>\u2022\tGupta et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2011;52:e103-20</p><p>\u2022\tKranz et al. Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2017;114:866-873.</p><p>\u2022\tNICE guideline [NG109]. Urinary tract infection (lower): antimicrobial prescribing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional clinical trial evidence was submitted in support of this application, however commented that these trials used dose schedules (of trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin or cefalexin) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) in the control arm which are not used for standard care in New Zealand. It was also noted that some of the additional evidence pertained to prophylaxis or to the treatment of UTI in pregnancy. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence was not relevant to the indication under assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI was of moderate strength and quality, and that this supported a benefit of fosfomycin for the treatment of multi-drug resistant E. coli, however the risks of GI intolerance are likely to be higher than that of nitrofurantoin.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that women with frequent UTIs and multi-drug resistant E. coli infection would benefit the most from treatment with fosfomycin, noting that this would not include pregnant women with UTIs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was most important for fosfomycin to be used appropriately and that this use would be in patients for whom there is evidence of resistance and where fosfomycin is the most appropriate therapy. Members considered that it would be better to educate prescribers to use fosfomycin appropriately, rather than adding a requirement to the special authority criteria for this product not to be used as a first-line treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that restricted prescriber access was appropriate for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, as wider access would likely result in increased antimicrobial resistance to this broad-spectrum antibiotic which may have an important role in salvage antimicrobial therapy for patients with multi-drug resistant organisms.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC staff provided evidence from a longitudinal study conducted across 27 hospitals in Spain which monitored the development of antimicrobial resistance to fosfomycin after introduction of this antibiotic for the treatment of UTIs in primary care (Oteo et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:2459-63). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported an increase in fosfomycin resistance among ESBL producing E.coli from 4.4% to 11.4% between 2005 to 2009, and that this increase corresponded to a 340% increase in fosfomycin usage from 1997 to 2009.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the dose form of fosfomycin was appropriate and that the stat dosing offers some advantages over existing treatments. Members considered the convenience of fosfomycin was important and that this would be a suitable oral treatment for use in children also.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin, if funded, would not create any significant changes in health sector expenditure other than direct treatment costs. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin would either not change, or only minimally reduce, the rates of complicated UTI or pyelonephritis requiring hospital admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed cost of fosfomycin would need to be considered relative to its place in the New Zealand treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin should be used as last line treatment after proven resistance to current therapies, in which case it would be a sequential treatment which would not replace any other antimicrobial agents.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that New Zealand patients who do not achieve full resolution of their infection from prior therapies (due to antimicrobial resistance) would influence potential costs and savings relating to fosfomycin, and that resistance rates (especially to E. coli) should be based on New Zealand data where available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, out of all cases treated with antimicrobial agents, the proportion of uncomplicated UTIs occurring in men (~20% of cases, requiring an additional dose of fosfomycin) and the proportion of complicated UTIs (proportion unknown) would influence the cost of funding fosfomycin due to potential slippage of the Special Authority criteria. Members considered that fosfomycin should have criteria to restrict its use in only the most appropriate treatment settings. Members considered that there would be a risk of slippage even with restriction criteria and optimal clinician education regarding appropriate use of fosfomycin.</p>",

The Subcommittee considered that women with uncomplicated UTI due to multi-drug resistant E. coli have a high health need.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application is for fosfomycin trometamol (herein referred to as fosfomycin), a broad-spectrum antibiotic which inhibits the first stage of bacterial wall synthesis and is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee considered that although the mechanism of action of fosfomycin is different to that of currently funded agents used for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, fosfomycin would be used for the same indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is supplied as powder in a 3g sachet, to be dissolved and taken as a stat dose on an empty stomach. The Subcommittee noted that males would require an additional dose on day four.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is not registered for use in New Zealand, however, District Health Board Hospitals have been sourcing fosfomycin under Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981. The Subcommittee noted that Te Arai BioFarma Ltd submitted an application for registration of fosfomycin to Medsafe in February 2018, and evaluation is underway. The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is listed on the Hospital Medicines List (HML) and a proposal for fosfomycin is currently ranked on PHARMACs Options for Investment list (with use restricted to treatment of patients with acute symptomatic bacteriologically-proven lower UTIs and with proven resistance or contraindication to all other oral antibiotics including nitrofurantoin, on the recommendation of an Infectious Disease physician or Clinical Microbiologist).</p><p>\t</p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised MON-US-03 clinical trial which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of treatment with nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated lower UTIs predominantly due to E. coli in 749 females (Stein et al. Clin Therap. 1999;21:1864-1872). The Subcommittee noted that the 1-week and 4 to 6-week post-treatment cure rates were 87% and 96% respectively for fosfomycin compared to 81% and 91% respectively for nitrofurantoin, although these did not reach statistical significance.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the overall clinical success rate for cure and improvement reported by Stein et al. was 80% in both treatment groups, and that the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar with 5.3% of patients in the fosfomycin group and 5.6% in the nitrofurantoin group reporting AEs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial of a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of nitrofurantoin 50 mg four times daily used as first-line treatment in 231 patients with symptoms of acute dysuria, stranguria and/or urinary frequency (van Pienbroek et al. Pharm World Sci. 1993;15:257-262). The Subcommittee noted that the day 9 cure rates were 81% for fosfomycin compared to 90% for nitrofurantoin, and that overall efficacy (symptoms and dipslide results) at day 42 were 88% in the fosfomycin group compared to 85% in the nitrofurantoin group although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted van Pienbroek et al. reported a large proportion of patient withdrawals due to AEs occurring by day 9, with 14 of patients withdrawn from the fosfomycin group compared to 4 from the nitrofurantoin group (P=0.015). The Subcommittee noted that AEs were primarily gastrointestinal (GI) and were greater at both day 4 and day 9 in the fosfomycin group than the nitrofurantoin group, but the statistical significance of these results was not reported. The Subcommittee noted that there were no withdrawals due to AEs in the nitrofurantoin group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a randomised (2:1) comparative study which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 5 days of treatment with trimethoprim 300 mg daily in 300 female patients between 18 and 65 years of age with uncomplicated UTIs predominantly due to E. coli (Minassian et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 1998;10:39-47). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported microbiological cure rates at day 7-9 of 83.3% in the fosfomycin group compared to 83% in the trimethoprim group, and infection persisted after treatment in about 17% of patients in each group, although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant. The Subcommittee noted that no safety data was reported.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following additional evidence for fosfomycin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, including meta-analyses, reviews and international guidelines:</p><p>\u2022\tFalagas et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:1862-77.</p><p>\u2022\tGrigoryan et al. JAMA. 2014;312:1677-84.</p><p>\u2022\tGupta et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2011;52:e103-20</p><p>\u2022\tKranz et al. Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2017;114:866-873.</p><p>\u2022\tNICE guideline [NG109]. Urinary tract infection (lower): antimicrobial prescribing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional clinical trial evidence was submitted in support of this application, however commented that these trials used dose schedules (of trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin or cefalexin) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) in the control arm which are not used for standard care in New Zealand. It was also noted that some of the additional evidence pertained to prophylaxis or to the treatment of UTI in pregnancy. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence was not relevant to the indication under assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI was of moderate strength and quality, and that this supported a benefit of fosfomycin for the treatment of multi-drug resistant E. coli, however the risks of GI intolerance are likely to be higher than that of nitrofurantoin.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that women with frequent UTIs and multi-drug resistant E. coli infection would benefit the most from treatment with fosfomycin, noting that this would not include pregnant women with UTIs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was most important for fosfomycin to be used appropriately and that this use would be in patients for whom there is evidence of resistance and where fosfomycin is the most appropriate therapy. Members considered that it would be better to educate prescribers to use fosfomycin appropriately, rather than adding a requirement to the special authority criteria for this product not to be used as a first-line treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that restricted prescriber access was appropriate for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, as wider access would likely result in increased antimicrobial resistance to this broad-spectrum antibiotic which may have an important role in salvage antimicrobial therapy for patients with multi-drug resistant organisms.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC staff provided evidence from a longitudinal study conducted across 27 hospitals in Spain which monitored the development of antimicrobial resistance to fosfomycin after introduction of this antibiotic for the treatment of UTIs in primary care (Oteo et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:2459-63). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported an increase in fosfomycin resistance among ESBL producing E.coli from 4.4% to 11.4% between 2005 to 2009, and that this increase corresponded to a 340% increase in fosfomycin usage from 1997 to 2009.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the dose form of fosfomycin was appropriate and that the stat dosing offers some advantages over existing treatments. Members considered the convenience of fosfomycin was important and that this would be a suitable oral treatment for use in children also.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin, if funded, would not create any significant changes in health sector expenditure other than direct treatment costs. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin would either not change, or only minimally reduce, the rates of complicated UTI or pyelonephritis requiring hospital admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed cost of fosfomycin would need to be considered relative to its place in the New Zealand treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin should be used as last line treatment after proven resistance to current therapies, in which case it would be a sequential treatment which would not replace any other antimicrobial agents.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that New Zealand patients who do not achieve full resolution of their infection from prior therapies (due to antimicrobial resistance) would influence potential costs and savings relating to fosfomycin, and that resistance rates (especially to E. coli) should be based on New Zealand data where available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, out of all cases treated with antimicrobial agents, the proportion of uncomplicated UTIs occurring in men (~20% of cases, requiring an additional dose of fosfomycin) and the proportion of complicated UTIs (proportion unknown) would influence the cost of funding fosfomycin due to potential slippage of the Special Authority criteria. Members considered that fosfomycin should have criteria to restrict its use in only the most appropriate treatment settings. Members considered that there would be a risk of slippage even with restriction criteria and optimal clinician education regarding appropriate use of fosfomycin.</p>",

          "Published_Recommendation__c": "<p>The Subcommittee recommended that fosfomycin trometamol (\u2018fosfomycin\u2019) be funded for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) with a high priority. The Subcommittee made this recommendation based on the need for another sequential agent for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by multi-drug resistant microorganisms in adults, particularly in women with recurrent UTIs, and in children. The Subcommittee made this recommendation subject to the following criteria:\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Restricted\u00a0</p><p>Initiation On the recommendation of clinical microbiologist or infectious disease specialist.</p><p>All of the following:\u00a0</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patient has an acute, symptomatic, bacteriologically-proven uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI); and</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bacteria, based on the microbiology report, is resistant to all other antibiotics including nitrofurantoin; or</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The patient has a contraindication or documented intolerance to all UTI antibiotics including nitrofurantoin.</p><p>Note: Fosfomycin should not be used for first-line treatment.

The Subcommittee noted that a proposal for fosfomycin to be listed in Section B of the Pharmaceutical Schedule is currently ranked on PHARMACs Options for Investment list (with use restricted to treatment of patients with acute symptomatic bacteriologically-proven lower UTIs and with proven resistance or contraindication to all other oral antibiotics including nitrofurantoin, on the recommendation of an Infectious Disease physician or Clinical Microbiologist).</p><p><br></p>",

          "Published_Discussion__c": "<p>The Subcommittee noted that a urinary tract infection (UTI) is either an infection of the bladder and lower urinary tract (cystitis) or an infection of the kidney and upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis), and that most UTIs are due to colonisation by pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that UTIs are classified as uncomplicated if there is no functional or anatomical abnormality in the urinary tract, no evidence of pyelonephritis, no renal functional impairment, and no concomitant condition that would promote a UTI. The Subcommittee noted that, if an uncomplicated UTI is left untreated, complications such as pyelonephritis, kidney damage, bacteraemia, and sepsis can develop.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of uncomplicated UTIs is very high, although most cases are mild and some require symptom management alone. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 200,000 patients each year are treated with funded antimicrobial agents for uncomplicated UTI according to community pharmacy claim data. The Subcommittee considered it was difficult to determine what proportion of antimicrobial agent use is for treatment of uncomplicated UTI (compared to prophylaxis).\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the incidence of uncomplicated UTI is much higher in women and would account for more than 80% of cases. The Subcommittee noted that a UTI occurring in pregnancy is a complicated UTI and that treatment of complicated UTIs is outside the requested indication for this application.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that uncomplicated UTIs do not disproportionately affect M\u0101ori or Pacific people. The Subcommittee considered that patients with lower socio-economic status may have an increased risk of complications if they have difficulties in accessing healthcare.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that New Zealand adult patient with uncomplicated UTIs due to E. coli would receive treatment with either trimethoprim (between 65% and 70% of cases), nitrofurantoin (30% of cases) or cefalexin (less than 5% of cases). The Subcommittee considered that other agents such as quinolones or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid may be used for first-line treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in a small number of cases and co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, or cefaclor were commonly used in young children (syrup formulations) with nitrofurantoin increasingly being required due to resistance. The Subcommittee considered that standard of care second-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs in New Zealand adults would be with nitrofurantoin (if not used first-line) rather than with norfloxacin.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the 2017 Canterbury Antimicrobial Susceptibility Report demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance (predominantly of E. coli) is climbing but has been relatively stable since 2009, reporting resistance rates in Canterbury of around 25% to trimethoprim and 4% to nitrofurantoin. Members considered that resistance to fosfomycin, which is currently used in New Zealand under Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981, is approximately 2%. The Subcommittee considered that rates of resistance vary, and noted that Erdem et al. (J Glob Infect Dis. 2018:10;129-32) report E. coli resistance rates of almost 14% to fosfomycin and about 18% to nitrofurantoin in Turkey.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that 2% of patients would be intolerant of antibiotics (based on withdrawal rates in clinical trials), and that there would be a small proportion of female patients with poor renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of less than 60 ml per minute) for whom nitrofurantoin would be contraindicated.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that there is a need for another treatment option after trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for multi-drug resistant E. coli. The Subcommittee considered that women with uncomplicated UTI due to multi-drug resistant E. coli have a high health need.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application is for fosfomycin trometamol (herein referred to as fosfomycin), a broad-spectrum antibiotic which inhibits the first stage of bacterial wall synthesis and is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Subcommittee considered that although the mechanism of action of fosfomycin is different to that of currently funded agents used for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, fosfomycin would be used for the same indication.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is supplied as powder in a 3g sachet, to be dissolved and taken as a stat dose on an empty stomach. The Subcommittee noted that males would require an additional dose on day four.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is not registered for use in New Zealand, however, District Health Board Hospitals have been sourcing fosfomycin under Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981. The Subcommittee noted that Te Arai BioFarma Ltd submitted an application for registration of fosfomycin to Medsafe in February 2018, and evaluation is underway. The Subcommittee noted that fosfomycin is listed on the Hospital Medicines List (HML) and a proposal for fosfomycin is currently ranked on PHARMACs Options for Investment list (with use restricted to treatment of patients with acute symptomatic bacteriologically-proven lower UTIs and with proven resistance or contraindication to all other oral antibiotics including nitrofurantoin, on the recommendation of an Infectious Disease physician or Clinical Microbiologist).</p><p>\t</p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the phase III, double-blind, randomised MON-US-03 clinical trial which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of treatment with nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated lower UTIs predominantly due to E. coli in 749 females (Stein et al. Clin Therap. 1999;21:1864-1872). The Subcommittee noted that the 1-week and 4 to 6-week post-treatment cure rates were 87% and 96% respectively for fosfomycin compared to 81% and 91% respectively for nitrofurantoin, although these did not reach statistical significance.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the overall clinical success rate for cure and improvement reported by Stein et al. was 80% in both treatment groups, and that the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar with 5.3% of patients in the fosfomycin group and 5.6% in the nitrofurantoin group reporting AEs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of the double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial of a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 7 days of nitrofurantoin 50 mg four times daily used as first-line treatment in 231 patients with symptoms of acute dysuria, stranguria and/or urinary frequency (van Pienbroek et al. Pharm World Sci. 1993;15:257-262). The Subcommittee noted that the day 9 cure rates were 81% for fosfomycin compared to 90% for nitrofurantoin, and that overall efficacy (symptoms and dipslide results) at day 42 were 88% in the fosfomycin group compared to 85% in the nitrofurantoin group although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted van Pienbroek et al. reported a large proportion of patient withdrawals due to AEs occurring by day 9, with 14 of patients withdrawn from the fosfomycin group compared to 4 from the nitrofurantoin group (P=0.015). The Subcommittee noted that AEs were primarily gastrointestinal (GI) and were greater at both day 4 and day 9 in the fosfomycin group than the nitrofurantoin group, but the statistical significance of these results was not reported. The Subcommittee noted that there were no withdrawals due to AEs in the nitrofurantoin group.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of a randomised (2:1) comparative study which investigated a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin compared to 5 days of treatment with trimethoprim 300 mg daily in 300 female patients between 18 and 65 years of age with uncomplicated UTIs predominantly due to E. coli (Minassian et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 1998;10:39-47). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported microbiological cure rates at day 7-9 of 83.3% in the fosfomycin group compared to 83% in the trimethoprim group, and infection persisted after treatment in about 17% of patients in each group, although both of these comparisons were not statistically significant. The Subcommittee noted that no safety data was reported.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the following additional evidence for fosfomycin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, including meta-analyses, reviews and international guidelines:</p><p>\u2022\tFalagas et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:1862-77.</p><p>\u2022\tGrigoryan et al. JAMA. 2014;312:1677-84.</p><p>\u2022\tGupta et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2011;52:e103-20</p><p>\u2022\tKranz et al. Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2017;114:866-873.</p><p>\u2022\tNICE guideline [NG109]. Urinary tract infection (lower): antimicrobial prescribing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that additional clinical trial evidence was submitted in support of this application, however commented that these trials used dose schedules (of trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin or cefalexin) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) in the control arm which are not used for standard care in New Zealand. It was also noted that some of the additional evidence pertained to prophylaxis or to the treatment of UTI in pregnancy. The Subcommittee considered that this evidence was not relevant to the indication under assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the evidence for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI was of moderate strength and quality, and that this supported a benefit of fosfomycin for the treatment of multi-drug resistant E. coli, however the risks of GI intolerance are likely to be higher than that of nitrofurantoin.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that women with frequent UTIs and multi-drug resistant E. coli infection would benefit the most from treatment with fosfomycin, noting that this would not include pregnant women with UTIs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that it was most important for fosfomycin to be used appropriately and that this use would be in patients for whom there is evidence of resistance and where fosfomycin is the most appropriate therapy. Members considered that it would be better to educate prescribers to use fosfomycin appropriately, rather than adding a requirement to the special authority criteria for this product not to be used as a first-line treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that restricted prescriber access was appropriate for fosfomycin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, as wider access would likely result in increased antimicrobial resistance to this broad-spectrum antibiotic which may have an important role in salvage antimicrobial therapy for patients with multi-drug resistant organisms.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC staff provided evidence from a longitudinal study conducted across 27 hospitals in Spain which monitored the development of antimicrobial resistance to fosfomycin after introduction of this antibiotic for the treatment of UTIs in primary care (Oteo et al. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010;65:2459-63). The Subcommittee noted that the authors reported an increase in fosfomycin resistance among ESBL producing E.coli from 4.4% to 11.4% between 2005 to 2009, and that this increase corresponded to a 340% increase in fosfomycin usage from 1997 to 2009.</p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the dose form of fosfomycin was appropriate and that the stat dosing offers some advantages over existing treatments. Members considered the convenience of fosfomycin was important and that this would be a suitable oral treatment for use in children also.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin, if funded, would not create any significant changes in health sector expenditure other than direct treatment costs. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin would either not change, or only minimally reduce, the rates of complicated UTI or pyelonephritis requiring hospital admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the proposed cost of fosfomycin would need to be considered relative to its place in the New Zealand treatment paradigm. The Subcommittee considered that fosfomycin should be used as last line treatment after proven resistance to current therapies, in which case it would be a sequential treatment which would not replace any other antimicrobial agents.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that New Zealand patients who do not achieve full resolution of their infection from prior therapies (due to antimicrobial resistance) would influence potential costs and savings relating to fosfomycin, and that resistance rates (especially to E. coli) should be based on New Zealand data where available.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that, out of all cases treated with antimicrobial agents, the proportion of uncomplicated UTIs occurring in men (~20% of cases, requiring an additional dose of fosfomycin) and the proportion of complicated UTIs (proportion unknown) would influence the cost of funding fosfomycin due to potential slippage of the Special Authority criteria. Members considered that fosfomycin should have criteria to restrict its use in only the most appropriate treatment settings. Members considered that there would be a risk of slippage even with restriction criteria and optimal clinician education regarding appropriate use of fosfomycin.</p>",

At that time, the Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC received two items of correspondence (March 2019 and April 2019) from the applicant regarding the proposed place of fosfomycin in therapy, with the second correspondence item requesting fosfomycin as a second-line option after nitrofurantoin failure or where there is a contraindication or intolerance to other treatment options. In May 2019, the Subcommittee had recommended that fosfomycin be funded for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs with a high priority, subject to Special Authority criteria (for Section B) or Restriction criteria (for Section H) as detailed in the May 2019 record.</p><p>5.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that PHARMAC had received correspondence in July 2020 from Te Arai Biofarma, the supplier of UroFos (fosfomycin) following registration of this product. The Subcommittee noted that Te Arai Biofarma requested clarification on the recommended funding criteria for fosfomycin, including specific antibiotic treatments to be used for UTIs prior to use of fosfomycin; whether an endorsement was more appropriate than Restriction criteria; and proposing that urologists should be added as a prescriber type. In their correspondence, Te Arai Biofarma proposed the following endorsement for fosfomycin which the supplier considered would constrain fosfomycin to the third-line use in symptomatic, uncomplicated acute UTIs, which they believe is consistent with the Subcommittee\u2019s May 2019 recommendations:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">The bacteria, based on the microbiology report, is resistant to other </span><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">first line UTI\u00a0</b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">antibiotics including nitrofurantoin; or\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">The patient has a contraindication or documented intolerance to </span><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">other</b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">\u00a0</span><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">first line\u00a0</b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">UTI antibiotics including nitrofurantoin.</span></p><p>5.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered it important for the place of fosfomycin in the funded treatment paradigm for treatment of UTIs ensures its appropriate use in primary care and follows the principles of antimicrobial stewardship.
