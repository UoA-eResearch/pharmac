The Subcommittee noted that the proportion of Māori patients with ROS1 NSCLS is unknown; however, it has previously been considered reasonable to assume a similar rate of 1-2%, noting no elevated risk for Māori to account for the increased prevalence of ROS1 NSCLC amongst non-smokers.

The Subcommittee noted evidence indicating improved response to pemetrexed-based chemotherapies in ROS1 NSCLC patients with evidence of progression free survival (PFS) of approximately 8 months (range 6.4-11 months), however they also noted this evidence involved small patient numbers and was unlikely to be duplicated in the future given the international availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for this patient group (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29883837/"" target=""_blank"">Park et al.

The Subcommittee noted this may be followed with second line chemotherapy with 3 weekly docetaxel, for up to 6 cycles, in patients who remain well enough to receive treatment at disease progression. The Subcommittee noted that patients with a poor performance status, which can result from the symptom burden of advanced lung cancer, would be unlikely to tolerate systemic chemotherapy and this is generally not recommended in these patients.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that chemotherapy has high toxicity.

N Engl J Med. 2018;378:2078-92</a>). The Subcommittee consider that the proportion of patients who are unfit for standard platinum-based chemotherapy is unknown, as NSCLC is usually diagnosed with late-stage disease, and many patients are not even considered for chemotherapy.

This may be due to availability of the tissue as the biopsy sample is used hierarchically for mutation testing after the histology is confirmed, or patient suitability to undergo a tissue biopsy, and that ROS1 tissue-based testing at diagnosis is not currently part of the standard testing panel. The Subcommittee considered that biomarker testing for ROS1 would likely be sequential following testing for ALK and EGFR, and considered that, as testing for ROS1 becomes more prevalent and/or ctDNA blood testing becomes available, the number of patients tested may increase, and that given the low prevalence of disease a small increase in patient numbers eligible for ROS1 targeted therapy may be seen.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that crizotinib and entrectinib are both multi-targeted inhibitors with different targets and mechanisms of action: crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK and c-MET as well as ROS1, which acts as a target for p-Glycoprotein; entrectinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (encoded by the NTRK genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3, respectively), ROS1 and ALK.

The Subcommittee considered that the biological rationale is robust, the parallel data with ALK inhibitors and the clinical interpretation of this data supports the conclusion that ROS1 targeted treatments in ROS1 NSCLC provide a durable response and progression-free survival, substantively superior to chemotherapy, with favourable toxicity. The Subcommittee considered the evidence was compelling and consistent in the context of this disease with low patient numbers meaning that only phase I or II or retrospective cohort studies were viable, without randomised data available. The Subcommittee considered that it is very unlikely that there will be further phase III randomised trials for either of these agents against a chemotherapy comparator, as ROS1 targeted therapies have been approved in other jurisdictions for some time.

The Subcommittee considered that biomarker testing for ROS1 would likely be sequential following testing for ALK and EGFR, and considered that, as testing for ROS1 becomes more prevalent and/or ctDNA blood testing becomes available, the number of patients tested may increase, and that given the low prevalence of disease a small increase in patient numbers eligible for ROS1 targeted therapy may be seen.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that crizotinib and entrectinib are both multi-targeted inhibitors with different targets and mechanisms of action: crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK and c-MET as well as ROS1, which acts as a target for p-Glycoprotein; entrectinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (encoded by the NTRK genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3, respectively), ROS1 and ALK.

The Subcommittee considered that the biological rationale is robust, the parallel data with ALK inhibitors and the clinical interpretation of this data supports the conclusion that ROS1 targeted treatments in ROS1 NSCLC provide a durable response and progression-free survival, substantively superior to chemotherapy, with favourable toxicity. The Subcommittee considered the evidence was compelling and consistent in the context of this disease with low patient numbers meaning that only phase I or II or retrospective cohort studies were viable, without randomised data available. The Subcommittee considered that it is very unlikely that there will be further phase III randomised trials for either of these agents against a chemotherapy comparator, as ROS1 targeted therapies have been approved in other jurisdictions for some time. The Subcommittee noted that crizotinib has been approved by both the PBAC and Scottish Medicines Consortium in July 2018, and in Canada in May 2019, and that entrectinib was approved by the PBAC in March 2020, NICE (UK and Wales) August 2020, Scotland December 2020, and Canada in January 2021.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend single agent crizotinib or entrectinib in the first line or second line in patients with stage IV NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement, and considered this would be the likely treatment paradigm should these agents be funded in New Zealand <a href=""https://www.esmo.org/content/download/347819/6934778/1/ESMO-CPG-mNSCLC-15SEPT2020.pdf"" target=""_blank"">(ESMO 2020.

The Subcommittee considered that the biological rationale is robust, the parallel data with ALK inhibitors and the clinical interpretation of this data supports the conclusion that ROS1 targeted treatments in ROS1 NSCLC provide a durable response and progression-free survival, substantively superior to chemotherapy, with favourable toxicity. The Subcommittee considered the evidence was compelling and consistent in the context of this disease with low patient numbers meaning that only phase I or II or retrospective cohort studies were viable, without randomised data available. The Subcommittee considered that it is very unlikely that there will be further phase III randomised trials for either of these agents against a chemotherapy comparator, as ROS1 targeted therapies have been approved in other jurisdictions for some time. The Subcommittee noted that crizotinib has been approved by both the PBAC and Scottish Medicines Consortium in July 2018, and in Canada in May 2019, and that entrectinib was approved by the PBAC in March 2020, NICE (UK and Wales) August 2020, Scotland December 2020, and Canada in January 2021.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend single agent crizotinib or entrectinib in the first line or second line in patients with stage IV NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement, and considered this would be the likely treatment paradigm should these agents be funded in New Zealand <a href=""https://www.esmo.org/content/download/347819/6934778/1/ESMO-CPG-mNSCLC-15SEPT2020.pdf"" target=""_blank"">(ESMO 2020.

However, they considered that while the applicant has proposed there is a potential difference between crizotinib and entrectinib due to different effects on brain metastases relating to CNS penetration. The Subcommittee considered that a therapeutic agent that can cross the blood-brain barrier is an attractive option in NSCLC, but that there was currently insufficient evidence that entrectinib is more effective than crizotinib in this setting.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.24.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered both crizotinib and entrectinib have suitability advantages over current chemotherapy treatment and may provide health system advantages due to reduced infusion requirements when compared to chemotherapy.\xa0The Subcommittee considered the impact of these advantages was difficult to predict, as numbers are very small, and as there may be some patients who progress to chemotherapy following TKI treatment who may have been considered unsuitable for this in the first line.
