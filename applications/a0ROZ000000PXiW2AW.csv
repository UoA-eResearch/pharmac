The Subcommittee noted that PTAC had considered that although there were no head-to-head trials comparing abiraterone with enzalutamide, and taking into account different drug interaction profiles, it was reasonable to consider them clinically equivalent in the treatment of mCRPC. The Subcommittee considered that PTAC’s review indicated that the evidence for benefits from enzalutamide, including health-related quality of life (HRQOL), was relevant to the New Zealand population and of good quality</p><p>8.8<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the feedback relating to enzalutamide for mCRPC that was received in response to Pharmac’s <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations-and-decisions/consultation-2020-10-01-inactive-declines/?type=Consultation&amp;page=2&amp;dateFrom=2020-01&amp;dateTo=2021-01"" target=""_blank"">October 2020 proposal to decline currently inactive funding applications</a>, including the response from clinicians in Auckland who considered that those who can’t have abiraterone should have access to enzalutamide because this small proportion of patients would have no other treatment options.

The Subcommittee considered that intolerances or contraindications to abiraterone that prevent the safe and effective use of funded abiraterone in these populations would have the potential to increase inequitable outcomes.</p><p>8.11<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that abiraterone acetate is funded with <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2021/11/01/SA2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Special Authority criteria</a> and that patients with mCRPC may also be able to receive chemotherapy with docetaxel, usually in combination with prednisone. However, the Subcommittee considered that docetaxel has variable use around the country and might be used in select cases where a clinician has a strong preference for its use (eg as initial treatment for patients with greater disease volume or activity, or those with visceral involvement). The Subcommittee considered that if a contraindication or intolerance results in a patient not being suitable for abiraterone then they are unlikely to be suitable for docetaxel for the same reason, and therefore would have no effective treatment options.</p><p>8.12<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are known treatment-related toxicities that can occur with abiraterone and with docetaxel. The Subcommittee considered that abiraterone could be contraindicated due to liver disease, hypertension or adrenocorticoid deficiency, although those toxicities could also develop whilst on treatment and such cases would be challenging to disentangle. The Subcommittee considered that a significant intolerance to abiraterone acetate such as grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity, heart failure, or fluid retention could result in hospitalisation and/or a decrease in HRQOL. The Subcommittee considered that the clinical trial evidence suggests only 1% of patients would discontinue abiraterone acetate due to unmanageable intolerance.</p><p>8.13<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that even for those with mCRPC with pre-existing liver disease, most clinicians would commence treatment with abiraterone acetate and closely monitor patients on treatment with an intensity of monitoring relative to the extent of liver disease. The Subcommittee considered that clinicians would try to manage intolerances that arise (eg LFT abnormalities) with dose reductions and therefore that a confirmed intolerance could be observed within the first three- to six months from the start of treatment with abiraterone acetate. The Subcommittee considered that, for patients experiencing a significant intolerance, it would be reasonable for Pharmac to assume that in most cases this would occur within the first three months on abiraterone, as this would align with patient assessment at three-monthly clinic visits.</p><p>8.14<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in practice, few patients with mCRPC experience intolerance to abiraterone acetate that cannot be effectively managed and even fewer would have a contraindication that precluded treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to estimate that 10% of patients in the LATITUDE trial of abiraterone plus prednisone in mCRPC (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1704174#article_Abstract"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al. N Engl J Med 2017; 377:352-60</a>) might have been excluded at screening due to hepatotoxicity (ie 2.9% of the intention-to-treat population). The Subcommittee noted that about five patients per year in Auckland would be contraindicated to abiraterone and only one or two patients per year would be intolerant to abiraterone, and that smaller numbers per capita would be seen around the rest of the country, since Auckland is a treatment hub serving about 38% of the population. The Subcommittee considered that these assumptions supported an estimate of approximately 20 patients per year nationwide who would be contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone, which was lower than Pharmac’s estimate of about 33 patients per year.</p><p>8.15<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the evidence for enzalutamide in mCRPC that had been reviewed and detailed previously by PTAC in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2016-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">August 2016</a>; specifically, from the PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">8.15.1<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the first-line PREVAIL trial (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1405095"" target=""_blank"">Beer et al.

However, the Subcommittee noted that the chance of receiving a response to a second treatment after disease progression was low. The Subcommittee noted that in the treatment setting being considered, patients with mCRPC would either not have received abiraterone or only received abiraterone briefly until it was intolerable (as opposed to continuing until progression). The Subcommittee considered that it was likely that treatment with enzalutamide after more than three months treatment with abiraterone acetate would provide a lesser benefit and that this available evidence for sequencing supported the proposed three-month timeframe for an intolerance in the funding criteria for enzalutamide.</p><p>8.24<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would provide suitability benefits as it is an oral medicine that could enable treatment closer to home, improving quality of life for this subgroup with mCRPC. The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would be used in combination with ADT rather than replacing ADT and considered that no other treatments would be expected to be used at the same time. The Subcommittee considered that monitoring whilst on enzalutamide would be done more frequently than for patients receiving ADT alone, with extra clinic visits required while they were on treatment similar to what is performed for patients receiving abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that no additional resource for management of AEs would be expected as this would be similar to the standard of care already provided. The Subcommittee considered that patients would have blood tests three-monthly and radiologic scans performed as clinically indicated. The Subcommittee considered that patients with mCRPC would likely receive palliative care after disease progression (eg radiotherapy to metastatic bone lesions and medicine for pain) although there was no evidence to suggest that the rate of palliative radiotherapy would change with enzalutamide treatment. Members considered that the need for radiation therapy may be delayed due to improved disease control.</p><p>8.25<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that docetaxel would not be a comparator treatment option for the subgroup of patients who are intolerant of or contraindicated to abiraterone acetate, as they are unlikely to be candidates for docetaxel for the same reason. The Subcommittee considered that the estimate of 18% of patients receiving docetaxel upfront before use of enzalutamide (if funded) was plausible. The Subcommittee considered that for low volume disease there would likely be a preference to use abiraterone or enzalutamide ahead of docetaxel, unless there were concerns about disease activity or visceral involvement. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30% of patients who would receive enzalutamide might not receive docetaxel subsequently, primarily due to comorbidities or the same contraindication they had to abiraterone.</p><p>8.26<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding criteria for enzalutamide for patients with mCRPC who are contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone could target the intended population by requiring a significant intolerance, not further described, within the first three months of treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable for Pharmac to review enzalutamide usage within a year from the start of funding.</p><p>8.27<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for enzalutamide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for </span>patients with mCRPC who are contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone<span style=""color: black;"">.

The Subcommittee noted that PTAC had considered that although there were no head-to-head trials comparing abiraterone with enzalutamide, and taking into account different drug interaction profiles, it was reasonable to consider them clinically equivalent in the treatment of mCRPC. The Subcommittee considered that PTAC’s review indicated that the evidence for benefits from enzalutamide, including health-related quality of life (HRQOL), was relevant to the New Zealand population and of good quality</p><p>8.8<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the feedback relating to enzalutamide for mCRPC that was received in response to Pharmac’s <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations-and-decisions/consultation-2020-10-01-inactive-declines/?type=Consultation&amp;page=2&amp;dateFrom=2020-01&amp;dateTo=2021-01"" target=""_blank"">October 2020 proposal to decline currently inactive funding applications</a>, including the response from clinicians in Auckland who considered that those who can’t have abiraterone should have access to enzalutamide because this small proportion of patients would have no other treatment options.

The Subcommittee considered that intolerances or contraindications to abiraterone that prevent the safe and effective use of funded abiraterone in these populations would have the potential to increase inequitable outcomes.</p><p>8.11<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that abiraterone acetate is funded with <a href=""https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2021/11/01/SA2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Special Authority criteria</a> and that patients with mCRPC may also be able to receive chemotherapy with docetaxel, usually in combination with prednisone. However, the Subcommittee considered that docetaxel has variable use around the country and might be used in select cases where a clinician has a strong preference for its use (eg as initial treatment for patients with greater disease volume or activity, or those with visceral involvement). The Subcommittee considered that if a contraindication or intolerance results in a patient not being suitable for abiraterone then they are unlikely to be suitable for docetaxel for the same reason, and therefore would have no effective treatment options.</p><p>8.12<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are known treatment-related toxicities that can occur with abiraterone and with docetaxel. The Subcommittee considered that abiraterone could be contraindicated due to liver disease, hypertension or adrenocorticoid deficiency, although those toxicities could also develop whilst on treatment and such cases would be challenging to disentangle. The Subcommittee considered that a significant intolerance to abiraterone acetate such as grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity, heart failure, or fluid retention could result in hospitalisation and/or a decrease in HRQOL. The Subcommittee considered that the clinical trial evidence suggests only 1% of patients would discontinue abiraterone acetate due to unmanageable intolerance.</p><p>8.13<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that even for those with mCRPC with pre-existing liver disease, most clinicians would commence treatment with abiraterone acetate and closely monitor patients on treatment with an intensity of monitoring relative to the extent of liver disease. The Subcommittee considered that clinicians would try to manage intolerances that arise (eg LFT abnormalities) with dose reductions and therefore that a confirmed intolerance could be observed within the first three- to six months from the start of treatment with abiraterone acetate. The Subcommittee considered that, for patients experiencing a significant intolerance, it would be reasonable for Pharmac to assume that in most cases this would occur within the first three months on abiraterone, as this would align with patient assessment at three-monthly clinic visits.</p><p>8.14<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in practice, few patients with mCRPC experience intolerance to abiraterone acetate that cannot be effectively managed and even fewer would have a contraindication that precluded treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that it was reasonable to estimate that 10% of patients in the LATITUDE trial of abiraterone plus prednisone in mCRPC (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1704174#article_Abstract"" target=""_blank"">Fizazi et al. N Engl J Med 2017; 377:352-60</a>) might have been excluded at screening due to hepatotoxicity (ie 2.9% of the intention-to-treat population). The Subcommittee noted that about five patients per year in Auckland would be contraindicated to abiraterone and only one or two patients per year would be intolerant to abiraterone, and that smaller numbers per capita would be seen around the rest of the country, since Auckland is a treatment hub serving about 38% of the population. The Subcommittee considered that these assumptions supported an estimate of approximately 20 patients per year nationwide who would be contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone, which was lower than Pharmac’s estimate of about 33 patients per year.</p><p>8.15<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted the evidence for enzalutamide in mCRPC that had been reviewed and detailed previously by PTAC in <a href=""https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2016-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">August 2016</a>; specifically, from the PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">8.15.1<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the first-line PREVAIL trial (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1405095"" target=""_blank"">Beer et al.

However, the Subcommittee noted that the chance of receiving a response to a second treatment after disease progression was low. The Subcommittee noted that in the treatment setting being considered, patients with mCRPC would either not have received abiraterone or only received abiraterone briefly until it was intolerable (as opposed to continuing until progression). The Subcommittee considered that it was likely that treatment with enzalutamide after more than three months treatment with abiraterone acetate would provide a lesser benefit and that this available evidence for sequencing supported the proposed three-month timeframe for an intolerance in the funding criteria for enzalutamide.</p><p>8.24<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would provide suitability benefits as it is an oral medicine that could enable treatment closer to home, improving quality of life for this subgroup with mCRPC. The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would be used in combination with ADT rather than replacing ADT and considered that no other treatments would be expected to be used at the same time. The Subcommittee considered that monitoring whilst on enzalutamide would be done more frequently than for patients receiving ADT alone, with extra clinic visits required while they were on treatment similar to what is performed for patients receiving abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that no additional resource for management of AEs would be expected as this would be similar to the standard of care already provided. The Subcommittee considered that patients would have blood tests three-monthly and radiologic scans performed as clinically indicated. The Subcommittee considered that patients with mCRPC would likely receive palliative care after disease progression (eg radiotherapy to metastatic bone lesions and medicine for pain) although there was no evidence to suggest that the rate of palliative radiotherapy would change with enzalutamide treatment. Members considered that the need for radiation therapy may be delayed due to improved disease control.</p><p>8.25<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that docetaxel would not be a comparator treatment option for the subgroup of patients who are intolerant of or contraindicated to abiraterone acetate, as they are unlikely to be candidates for docetaxel for the same reason. The Subcommittee considered that the estimate of 18% of patients receiving docetaxel upfront before use of enzalutamide (if funded) was plausible. The Subcommittee considered that for low volume disease there would likely be a preference to use abiraterone or enzalutamide ahead of docetaxel, unless there were concerns about disease activity or visceral involvement. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30% of patients who would receive enzalutamide might not receive docetaxel subsequently, primarily due to comorbidities or the same contraindication they had to abiraterone.</p><p>8.26<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding criteria for enzalutamide for patients with mCRPC who are contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone could target the intended population by requiring a significant intolerance, not further described, within the first three months of treatment with abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that it would be reasonable for Pharmac to review enzalutamide usage within a year from the start of funding.</p><p>8.27<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for enzalutamide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for </span>patients with mCRPC who are contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone<span style=""color: black;"">.

The Subcommittee considered that a significant intolerance to abiraterone acetate such as grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity, heart failure, or fluid retention could result in hospitalisation and/or a decrease in HRQOL.

The Subcommittee considered that clinicians would try to manage intolerances that arise (eg LFT abnormalities) with dose reductions and therefore that a confirmed intolerance could be observed within the first three- to six months from the start of treatment with abiraterone acetate. The Subcommittee considered that, for patients experiencing a significant intolerance, it would be reasonable for Pharmac to assume that in most cases this would occur within the first three months on abiraterone, as this would align with patient assessment at three-monthly clinic visits.</p><p>8.14<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that in practice, few patients with mCRPC experience intolerance to abiraterone acetate that cannot be effectively managed and even fewer would have a contraindication that precluded treatment with abiraterone.

The Subcommittee noted that about five patients per year in Auckland would be contraindicated to abiraterone and only one or two patients per year would be intolerant to abiraterone, and that smaller numbers per capita would be seen around the rest of the country, since Auckland is a treatment hub serving about 38% of the population.

The Subcommittee noted that in the subset of patients with visceral liver or lung disease that there were no increased rates of elevated ALT compared with the overall trial population. The Subcommittee considered that the number of patients who discontinued enzalutamide in the clinical trials was relatively low. The Subcommittee considered that enzalutamide offers a treatment option that doesn’t have the same risk of LFT abnormalities that can occur with abiraterone acetate (or docetaxel) and considered that there is evidence that enzalutamide would provide a PFS benefit for entire population with mCRPC.</p><p>8.21<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the available evidence did not define the target subgroup of patients who were intolerant of or contraindicated to abiraterone.

However, the Subcommittee noted that the chance of receiving a response to a second treatment after disease progression was low. The Subcommittee noted that in the treatment setting being considered, patients with mCRPC would either not have received abiraterone or only received abiraterone briefly until it was intolerable (as opposed to continuing until progression). The Subcommittee considered that it was likely that treatment with enzalutamide after more than three months treatment with abiraterone acetate would provide a lesser benefit and that this available evidence for sequencing supported the proposed three-month timeframe for an intolerance in the funding criteria for enzalutamide.</p><p>8.24<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would provide suitability benefits as it is an oral medicine that could enable treatment closer to home, improving quality of life for this subgroup with mCRPC. The Subcommittee noted that enzalutamide would be used in combination with ADT rather than replacing ADT and considered that no other treatments would be expected to be used at the same time. The Subcommittee considered that monitoring whilst on enzalutamide would be done more frequently than for patients receiving ADT alone, with extra clinic visits required while they were on treatment similar to what is performed for patients receiving abiraterone. The Subcommittee considered that no additional resource for management of AEs would be expected as this would be similar to the standard of care already provided. The Subcommittee considered that patients would have blood tests three-monthly and radiologic scans performed as clinically indicated. The Subcommittee considered that patients with mCRPC would likely receive palliative care after disease progression (eg radiotherapy to metastatic bone lesions and medicine for pain) although there was no evidence to suggest that the rate of palliative radiotherapy would change with enzalutamide treatment. Members considered that the need for radiation therapy may be delayed due to improved disease control.</p><p>8.25<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that docetaxel would not be a comparator treatment option for the subgroup of patients who are intolerant of or contraindicated to abiraterone acetate, as they are unlikely to be candidates for docetaxel for the same reason. The Subcommittee considered that the estimate of 18% of patients receiving docetaxel upfront before use of enzalutamide (if funded) was plausible. The Subcommittee considered that for low volume disease there would likely be a preference to use abiraterone or enzalutamide ahead of docetaxel, unless there were concerns about disease activity or visceral involvement. The Subcommittee considered that approximately 30% of patients who would receive enzalutamide might not receive docetaxel subsequently, primarily due to comorbidities or the same contraindication they had to abiraterone.</p><p>8.26<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the funding criteria for enzalutamide for patients with mCRPC who are contraindicated to or intolerant of abiraterone could target the intended population by requiring a significant intolerance, not further described, within the first three months of treatment with abiraterone.
