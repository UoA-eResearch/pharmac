The Subcommittee noted that the health need of patients with unresectable HCC was described in depth at that meeting and considered these health need considerations remained accurate and would apply to the patient population considered for the atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab application. The Subcommittee reiterated its comments noting an unmet need for effective treatment options for patients with unresectable HCC and noted there is a disproportionately high incidence of this disease in Māori and Pacific people with incidence three times higher amongst the Māori population when compared with the non-Māori population (<a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/cancer-new-registrations-deaths-2013-nov16.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cancer – New Registrations and Deaths. 2013. Ministry of Health</a>) and also associated with an increased rate of mortality.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that, compared with reported international incidence rates, New Zealand has a high incidence of HCC and considered this may be associated with high rates of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fatty liver related HCC, compounded by increasing rates of metabolic disease. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there are no funded systemic treatment options for patients with advanced unresectable HCC in New Zealand beyond palliative care, with a median overall survival of HCC secondary to hepatitis B and hepatitis C of 5.2 and 8.3 months respectively (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32438374/"" target=""_blank"">Shauer et al. N Z Med J. 2020;133:25-34</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that international guidelines recommend atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of intermediate and advanced HCC, with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and lenvatinib then recommended in the second line setting or in patients ineligible for immunotherapy (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33510460/"" target=""_blank"">Llovet et al. Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2021;18:293-313</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted a lack of randomised controlled trials comparing atezolizumab with bevacizumab directly with best supportive care as is available in the New Zealand setting and considered indirect comparisons would be required to evaluate likely benefit in the New Zealand patient population. The Subcommittee noted two trials evaluating sorafenib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapeutic agent) as first line treatment of HCC compared to placebo: </p><p><br></p><p>A phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sorafenib compared with placebo for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19095497/"" target=""_blank"">Cheng et al. Lancet Oncol. 2009;10:25-34</a>). The Subcommittee noted that overall survival (OS) with sorafenib was 6.5 months, compared with the 4.2 months with placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68; p=0.014) with a time to progression of 2.8 months compared with 1.4 months with placebo (HR 0.57; p=0.0005). </p><p><br></p><p>A multi-centre phase III, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of sorafenib compared with placebo in the treatment of HCC (the SHARP trial<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18650514/"" target=""_blank"">; Llovet et al. N Engl J Med. 2008;359:378-90</a>), where the median overall survival for sorafenib was 10.7 months versus 7.9 months with placebo (HR 0.69; p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted it has previously reviewed both trials in its assessment of sorafenib for the treatment of HCC (<a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-catsop-subcommittee-minutes-2010-04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April 2010</a>) and at the time did not consider treatment with sorafenib to result in a meaningful change in progression-free or overall survival. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that atezolizumab and bevacizumab are recommended to be used in combination for HCC (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33716105/"" target=""_blank"">Vogel et al. Ann Oncol. 2021;36:801-5</a>) and considered this reflected their complementary activity through efficient tumour cells apoptosis secondary to bevacizumab usage combined with the ability of atezolizumab to enable efficient presentation of tumour antigens culminating in improved priming and activation of immune cells which can then travel to the tumour to perpetuate the cancer immunity cycle. The Subcommittee noted that various combinations of immunotherapy and angiogenic agents are being used and evaluated in cancer treatment and considered the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab for HCC to have the most mature data to date. The Subcommittee noted other trials comparing immunotherapy alone with sorafenib for HCC did not report clinically significant improvements in progression-free survival:</p><p><br></p><p>CheckMate 459 (<a href=""https://www.annalsofoncology.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0923-7534%2819%2960389-3"" target=""_blank"">Yau et al.

Lancet Oncol. 2020;21:808-20</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients in “Group A” (n=104) received atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks, with patients in “Group F” randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or atezolizumab alone (n=119; 60 to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; 59 to atezolizumab monotherapy). The Subcommittee noted the primary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms; with the primary end point for Group A of objective response rate (ORR) and the primary endpoint for Group F of PFS. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in Group A, 37 (36%; 95% CI 26 to 46) patients achieved a confirmed objective response, and in Group F, median PFS was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6 to 7·4) in the combination group, versus 3·4 months (95% CI 1·9 to 5·2) in the atezolizumab monotherapy group (HR 0·55; 80% CI 0·40 to 0·74; p=0·011). The Subcommittee noted that in Group A there was an apparent overall response rate benefit across all subgroups and noted that in Group F the PFS hazard ratios consistently favoured atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, as opposed to atezolizumab monotherapy, across all subgroups investigated. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the global open-label phase III trial of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in the treatment of unresectable HCC (IMbrave150; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32402160/"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:1894-1905</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the trial had a median follow up of 8.6 months at time of publishing, with a patient sample size of 501 and considered that the sample size was sufficient to enable power to detect a hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.71 using a log-rank test at a two-sided 0.048 significance level.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were no significant differences between the patient cohorts in the two treatment arms, and that all participants in the trial had an ECOG score of 0-1 with well-compensated disease and Child-Pugh Class A scores. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival (OS) for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group was not reached, with an OS at six months of 84.4% of participants. The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for the sorafenib group was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.4 to ‘not reached’) with an OS at six months of 72.2% of participants, which the Subcommittee noted was longer than the OS observed in sorafenib treatment arms in other trials. The Subcommittee considered that the longer OS for sorafenib observed in IMBrave 150 compared with SHARP was likely due to be related to subsequent systemic lines of treatments taken by sorafenib patients in IMBrave 150 (including tyrosine inhibitors and immunotherapy), which are not funded for patients in New Zealand with HCC. The Subcommittee also considered that best supportive care has improved over time, and that this may have an impact on prolonging OS in more recent studies compared to historical data. The Subcommittee considered the progression-free survival benefit in IMbrave 150 to be encouraging but considered the greatest benefit to be the prolonged overall survival with atezolizumab with bevacizumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for death was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79). The Subcommittee noted that the median progression free survival was 6.8 months for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab treated group (95% CI 5.7 to 8.3) compared with 4.3 months for the sorafenib group (95% CI 4.0 to 5.6). The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.59 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee was made aware of a 2021 update of IMbrave150 (<a href=""https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2021.39.3_suppl.267"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:267[no. 3 suppl</a>]), which had a median follow-up of 15.6 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival was 19.2 months with atezolizumab with bevacizumab compared to 13.4 months with sorafenib (HR for death 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85; p=0.0009). The Subcommittee noted that at 18 months OS was 52% in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group and 40% in the sorafenib group, with no new safety signals were reported. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that confirmed objective response rates (ORRs) were higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (ORR 27.3%, 95% CI 22.5 to 32.5) compared with the sorafenib group (11.9%, 95% CI 7.4 to 18.0) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed ORR for HCC-Specific mRECIST criteria was also higher for those receiving atezolizumab with bevacizumab (33.2%, 95% CI 28.1 to 38.6) compared with sorafenib (13.3%, 95% CI 8.4 to 19.6; p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the ongoing ORR at data cut-off was higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (86.5%) compared with the sorafenib group (68.4%) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the IMbrave 150 trial measured quality-of-life as reported by the patient with deterioration defined as a decrease from baseline of 10 points or more on the EORTC QLQ–C30 maintained for two consecutive assessments or a decrease of 10 points or more in one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the mean time to deterioration of quality of life in the atezolizumab combination group was longer than for the sorafenib group, at 13.1 months versus 4.9 months respectively for physical functioning (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73), and 9.1 months and 3.6 months respectively for role functioning (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered quality of life measurements had clearly defined endpoints from the start of the trial and considered that the improvement in quality of life alongside the survival benefit adds validity to the quality-of-life results indicating patients without disease progression experience better quality of life; however, considered that declines in HR-QoL in this patient population are also likely to be attributed to other comorbidities associated with severe liver disease or cirrhosis, probably independent of treatment efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that serious adverse events were more common with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy than with sorafenib (38.0% and 30.8%, respectively), and that there were more events leading to withdrawal of trial drug in the combination therapy group compared to the sorafenib group (15.5% and 10.3%, respectively). The Subcommittee noted that the median duration of treatment was 7.4 months for atezolizumab, 6.9 months with bevacizumab, and 2.8 months with sorafenib. The Subcommittee also noted that there was a higher incidence and severity of liver toxicities in the combination treated group. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although the IMbrave 150 trial reported a statistically significant benefit of atezolizumab with bevacizumab over sorafenib, that the true comparator for the New Zealand population is ‘no treatment’, and so the magnitude of potential incremental benefit of atezolizumab and bevacizumab treatment in the New Zealand HCC patient population is unknown., but likely to be improved. The Subcommittee considered, however, the IMbrave 150 patient population to be similar to the HCC patient population in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that patients would be screened for eligibility for trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) when first presenting with HCC with localised disease, and that a majority of patients eligible for TACE would receive this prior to systemic therapy. The Subcommittee considered that systemic therapy would therefore be targeted towards patients who are ineligible or unsuitable for TACE. The Subcommittee considered that TACE would therefore not be an appropriate comparator for this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that HCC patients may live longer and with a better quality of life if atezolizumab with bevacizumab were to be funded, but that treatment related toxicities may lead to an increase in hospital visits. The Subcommittee considered that treatment frequencies requiring three weekly infusions would mean that patients would have to visit infusion centres and clinics more often than they would with current standard of care, which can be difficult for patients living rurally or experiencing socioeconomic depravation. The Subcommittee noted that patients would also require restaging scans, which have been indicated to be approximately 3 monthly, with half of patients having at least an additional two scans, in addition to 3-weekly blood testing for safety monitoring. The Subcommittee considered noted that, when bevacizumab is used for the treatment of other malignancies, clinicians typically use a lower dose than what was proposed for this indication, and considered this dose modification may be a way to mitigate the toxicity related to the combination therapy in HCC patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab were to be funded for the requested indication that there would likely be between 60 and 70 new patients per year eligible for treatment, with a small prevalent influx of approximately 30 patients in the first year due to the short median survival of these patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the IMbrave 150 trial, patients were permitted to remain on treatment after disease progression, but that the proposed Special Authority criteria require treatment to be discontinued on progression. The Subcommittee considered that in clinical practice it may be difficult to accurately assess disease progression due to liver related changes seen on diagnostic imaging and noted that international practice typically also requires treatment to stop at progression. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atezolizumab with bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of HCC.

The Subcommittee noted the primary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms; with the primary end point for Group A of objective response rate (ORR) and the primary endpoint for Group F of PFS. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in Group A, 37 (36%; 95% CI 26 to 46) patients achieved a confirmed objective response, and in Group F, median PFS was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6 to 7·4) in the combination group, versus 3·4 months (95% CI 1·9 to 5·2) in the atezolizumab monotherapy group (HR 0·55; 80% CI 0·40 to 0·74; p=0·011). The Subcommittee noted that in Group A there was an apparent overall response rate benefit across all subgroups and noted that in Group F the PFS hazard ratios consistently favoured atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, as opposed to atezolizumab monotherapy, across all subgroups investigated. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the global open-label phase III trial of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in the treatment of unresectable HCC (IMbrave150; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32402160/"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:1894-1905</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the trial had a median follow up of 8.6 months at time of publishing, with a patient sample size of 501 and considered that the sample size was sufficient to enable power to detect a hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.71 using a log-rank test at a two-sided 0.048 significance level.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were no significant differences between the patient cohorts in the two treatment arms, and that all participants in the trial had an ECOG score of 0-1 with well-compensated disease and Child-Pugh Class A scores. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival (OS) for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group was not reached, with an OS at six months of 84.4% of participants. The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for the sorafenib group was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.4 to ‘not reached’) with an OS at six months of 72.2% of participants, which the Subcommittee noted was longer than the OS observed in sorafenib treatment arms in other trials. The Subcommittee considered that the longer OS for sorafenib observed in IMBrave 150 compared with SHARP was likely due to be related to subsequent systemic lines of treatments taken by sorafenib patients in IMBrave 150 (including tyrosine inhibitors and immunotherapy), which are not funded for patients in New Zealand with HCC. The Subcommittee also considered that best supportive care has improved over time, and that this may have an impact on prolonging OS in more recent studies compared to historical data. The Subcommittee considered the progression-free survival benefit in IMbrave 150 to be encouraging but considered the greatest benefit to be the prolonged overall survival with atezolizumab with bevacizumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for death was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79). The Subcommittee noted that the median progression free survival was 6.8 months for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab treated group (95% CI 5.7 to 8.3) compared with 4.3 months for the sorafenib group (95% CI 4.0 to 5.6). The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.59 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee was made aware of a 2021 update of IMbrave150 (<a href=""https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2021.39.3_suppl.267"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:267[no. 3 suppl</a>]), which had a median follow-up of 15.6 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival was 19.2 months with atezolizumab with bevacizumab compared to 13.4 months with sorafenib (HR for death 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85; p=0.0009). The Subcommittee noted that at 18 months OS was 52% in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group and 40% in the sorafenib group, with no new safety signals were reported. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that confirmed objective response rates (ORRs) were higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (ORR 27.3%, 95% CI 22.5 to 32.5) compared with the sorafenib group (11.9%, 95% CI 7.4 to 18.0) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed ORR for HCC-Specific mRECIST criteria was also higher for those receiving atezolizumab with bevacizumab (33.2%, 95% CI 28.1 to 38.6) compared with sorafenib (13.3%, 95% CI 8.4 to 19.6; p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the ongoing ORR at data cut-off was higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (86.5%) compared with the sorafenib group (68.4%) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the IMbrave 150 trial measured quality-of-life as reported by the patient with deterioration defined as a decrease from baseline of 10 points or more on the EORTC QLQ–C30 maintained for two consecutive assessments or a decrease of 10 points or more in one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the mean time to deterioration of quality of life in the atezolizumab combination group was longer than for the sorafenib group, at 13.1 months versus 4.9 months respectively for physical functioning (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73), and 9.1 months and 3.6 months respectively for role functioning (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered quality of life measurements had clearly defined endpoints from the start of the trial and considered that the improvement in quality of life alongside the survival benefit adds validity to the quality-of-life results indicating patients without disease progression experience better quality of life; however, considered that declines in HR-QoL in this patient population are also likely to be attributed to other comorbidities associated with severe liver disease or cirrhosis, probably independent of treatment efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that serious adverse events were more common with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy than with sorafenib (38.0% and 30.8%, respectively), and that there were more events leading to withdrawal of trial drug in the combination therapy group compared to the sorafenib group (15.5% and 10.3%, respectively). The Subcommittee noted that the median duration of treatment was 7.4 months for atezolizumab, 6.9 months with bevacizumab, and 2.8 months with sorafenib. The Subcommittee also noted that there was a higher incidence and severity of liver toxicities in the combination treated group. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although the IMbrave 150 trial reported a statistically significant benefit of atezolizumab with bevacizumab over sorafenib, that the true comparator for the New Zealand population is ‘no treatment’, and so the magnitude of potential incremental benefit of atezolizumab and bevacizumab treatment in the New Zealand HCC patient population is unknown., but likely to be improved. The Subcommittee considered, however, the IMbrave 150 patient population to be similar to the HCC patient population in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that patients would be screened for eligibility for trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) when first presenting with HCC with localised disease, and that a majority of patients eligible for TACE would receive this prior to systemic therapy. The Subcommittee considered that systemic therapy would therefore be targeted towards patients who are ineligible or unsuitable for TACE. The Subcommittee considered that TACE would therefore not be an appropriate comparator for this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that HCC patients may live longer and with a better quality of life if atezolizumab with bevacizumab were to be funded, but that treatment related toxicities may lead to an increase in hospital visits. The Subcommittee considered that treatment frequencies requiring three weekly infusions would mean that patients would have to visit infusion centres and clinics more often than they would with current standard of care, which can be difficult for patients living rurally or experiencing socioeconomic depravation. The Subcommittee noted that patients would also require restaging scans, which have been indicated to be approximately 3 monthly, with half of patients having at least an additional two scans, in addition to 3-weekly blood testing for safety monitoring. The Subcommittee considered noted that, when bevacizumab is used for the treatment of other malignancies, clinicians typically use a lower dose than what was proposed for this indication, and considered this dose modification may be a way to mitigate the toxicity related to the combination therapy in HCC patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab were to be funded for the requested indication that there would likely be between 60 and 70 new patients per year eligible for treatment, with a small prevalent influx of approximately 30 patients in the first year due to the short median survival of these patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the IMbrave 150 trial, patients were permitted to remain on treatment after disease progression, but that the proposed Special Authority criteria require treatment to be discontinued on progression. The Subcommittee considered that in clinical practice it may be difficult to accurately assess disease progression due to liver related changes seen on diagnostic imaging and noted that international practice typically also requires treatment to stop at progression. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atezolizumab with bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of HCC. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by PHARMAC staff.

Lancet Oncol. 2020;21:808-20</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that patients in “Group A” (n=104) received atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks, with patients in “Group F” randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or atezolizumab alone (n=119; 60 to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; 59 to atezolizumab monotherapy). The Subcommittee noted the primary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms; with the primary end point for Group A of objective response rate (ORR) and the primary endpoint for Group F of PFS. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in Group A, 37 (36%; 95% CI 26 to 46) patients achieved a confirmed objective response, and in Group F, median PFS was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6 to 7·4) in the combination group, versus 3·4 months (95% CI 1·9 to 5·2) in the atezolizumab monotherapy group (HR 0·55; 80% CI 0·40 to 0·74; p=0·011). The Subcommittee noted that in Group A there was an apparent overall response rate benefit across all subgroups and noted that in Group F the PFS hazard ratios consistently favoured atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, as opposed to atezolizumab monotherapy, across all subgroups investigated. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the global open-label phase III trial of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in the treatment of unresectable HCC (IMbrave150; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32402160/"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:1894-1905</a>). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the trial had a median follow up of 8.6 months at time of publishing, with a patient sample size of 501 and considered that the sample size was sufficient to enable power to detect a hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.71 using a log-rank test at a two-sided 0.048 significance level.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there were no significant differences between the patient cohorts in the two treatment arms, and that all participants in the trial had an ECOG score of 0-1 with well-compensated disease and Child-Pugh Class A scores. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival (OS) for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group was not reached, with an OS at six months of 84.4% of participants. The Subcommittee noted that the median OS for the sorafenib group was 13.2 months (95% CI 10.4 to ‘not reached’) with an OS at six months of 72.2% of participants, which the Subcommittee noted was longer than the OS observed in sorafenib treatment arms in other trials. The Subcommittee considered that the longer OS for sorafenib observed in IMBrave 150 compared with SHARP was likely due to be related to subsequent systemic lines of treatments taken by sorafenib patients in IMBrave 150 (including tyrosine inhibitors and immunotherapy), which are not funded for patients in New Zealand with HCC. The Subcommittee also considered that best supportive care has improved over time, and that this may have an impact on prolonging OS in more recent studies compared to historical data. The Subcommittee considered the progression-free survival benefit in IMbrave 150 to be encouraging but considered the greatest benefit to be the prolonged overall survival with atezolizumab with bevacizumab. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for death was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79). The Subcommittee noted that the median progression free survival was 6.8 months for the atezolizumab with bevacizumab treated group (95% CI 5.7 to 8.3) compared with 4.3 months for the sorafenib group (95% CI 4.0 to 5.6). The Subcommittee noted that the stratified hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.59 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.76; p&lt;0.001). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee was made aware of a 2021 update of IMbrave150 (<a href=""https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2021.39.3_suppl.267"" target=""_blank"">Finn et al. J Clin Oncol. 2021;39:267[no. 3 suppl</a>]), which had a median follow-up of 15.6 months. The Subcommittee noted that the median overall survival was 19.2 months with atezolizumab with bevacizumab compared to 13.4 months with sorafenib (HR for death 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85; p=0.0009). The Subcommittee noted that at 18 months OS was 52% in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group and 40% in the sorafenib group, with no new safety signals were reported. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that confirmed objective response rates (ORRs) were higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (ORR 27.3%, 95% CI 22.5 to 32.5) compared with the sorafenib group (11.9%, 95% CI 7.4 to 18.0) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the confirmed ORR for HCC-Specific mRECIST criteria was also higher for those receiving atezolizumab with bevacizumab (33.2%, 95% CI 28.1 to 38.6) compared with sorafenib (13.3%, 95% CI 8.4 to 19.6; p&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the ongoing ORR at data cut-off was higher in the atezolizumab with bevacizumab group (86.5%) compared with the sorafenib group (68.4%) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the IMbrave 150 trial measured quality-of-life as reported by the patient with deterioration defined as a decrease from baseline of 10 points or more on the EORTC QLQ–C30 maintained for two consecutive assessments or a decrease of 10 points or more in one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the mean time to deterioration of quality of life in the atezolizumab combination group was longer than for the sorafenib group, at 13.1 months versus 4.9 months respectively for physical functioning (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73), and 9.1 months and 3.6 months respectively for role functioning (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84). </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered quality of life measurements had clearly defined endpoints from the start of the trial and considered that the improvement in quality of life alongside the survival benefit adds validity to the quality-of-life results indicating patients without disease progression experience better quality of life; however, considered that declines in HR-QoL in this patient population are also likely to be attributed to other comorbidities associated with severe liver disease or cirrhosis, probably independent of treatment efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that serious adverse events were more common with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy than with sorafenib (38.0% and 30.8%, respectively), and that there were more events leading to withdrawal of trial drug in the combination therapy group compared to the sorafenib group (15.5% and 10.3%, respectively). The Subcommittee noted that the median duration of treatment was 7.4 months for atezolizumab, 6.9 months with bevacizumab, and 2.8 months with sorafenib. The Subcommittee also noted that there was a higher incidence and severity of liver toxicities in the combination treated group. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that although the IMbrave 150 trial reported a statistically significant benefit of atezolizumab with bevacizumab over sorafenib, that the true comparator for the New Zealand population is ‘no treatment’, and so the magnitude of potential incremental benefit of atezolizumab and bevacizumab treatment in the New Zealand HCC patient population is unknown., but likely to be improved. The Subcommittee considered, however, the IMbrave 150 patient population to be similar to the HCC patient population in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that patients would be screened for eligibility for trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) when first presenting with HCC with localised disease, and that a majority of patients eligible for TACE would receive this prior to systemic therapy. The Subcommittee considered that systemic therapy would therefore be targeted towards patients who are ineligible or unsuitable for TACE. The Subcommittee considered that TACE would therefore not be an appropriate comparator for this patient population.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that HCC patients may live longer and with a better quality of life if atezolizumab with bevacizumab were to be funded, but that treatment related toxicities may lead to an increase in hospital visits. The Subcommittee considered that treatment frequencies requiring three weekly infusions would mean that patients would have to visit infusion centres and clinics more often than they would with current standard of care, which can be difficult for patients living rurally or experiencing socioeconomic depravation. The Subcommittee noted that patients would also require restaging scans, which have been indicated to be approximately 3 monthly, with half of patients having at least an additional two scans, in addition to 3-weekly blood testing for safety monitoring. The Subcommittee considered noted that, when bevacizumab is used for the treatment of other malignancies, clinicians typically use a lower dose than what was proposed for this indication, and considered this dose modification may be a way to mitigate the toxicity related to the combination therapy in HCC patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that if atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab were to be funded for the requested indication that there would likely be between 60 and 70 new patients per year eligible for treatment, with a small prevalent influx of approximately 30 patients in the first year due to the short median survival of these patients. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that in the IMbrave 150 trial, patients were permitted to remain on treatment after disease progression, but that the proposed Special Authority criteria require treatment to be discontinued on progression. The Subcommittee considered that in clinical practice it may be difficult to accurately assess disease progression due to liver related changes seen on diagnostic imaging and noted that international practice typically also requires treatment to stop at progression. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for atezolizumab with bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of HCC. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by PHARMAC staff. This PICO is based on the Subcommittee’s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by PHARMAC staff.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000GxHdG&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001djtS"" alt=""12.PNG""></img></p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000DKw8QAG'}, 'change': None}]",Nov 2020,False,True
