The Committee noted that the number of people with GIST in New Zealand is small and there is consequently limited evidence in this area. The Committee noted that no evidence was identified regarding the impact of advanced GIST on Māori health outcomes.

The Committee also noted a systematic review of literature (2000-2014) on the epidemiology of GIST noted that most studies reported incidence at 10-15 per million per year (equivalent to 50-75 people annually in New Zealand). The Committee noted that the range of incidence was 4.2 to 22 cases per million, which would equate to 20-100 cases in New Zealand annually (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877782115002519?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"">Søreide et al.

The Committee noted that advanced GIST is associated with pain, nausea, GI bleeding, abdominal bloating, and fatigue. The Committee noted that larger tumours may cause obstruction of the gastrointestinal lumen by endophytic growth or compression of the GIT from exophytic growth leading to dysphagia, obstructive jaundice, or constipation, depending on the location of the mass (<a href=""https://jgo.amegroups.com/article/view/23883/19709"" target=""_blank"">Parab et al.

The Committee noted that their life expectancy is short (a matter of months) and they have no further treatment available to them, other than best supportive care (ie palliative care), including pain and symptom management. The Committee noted that in Sui et al, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for the entire study population was 69% and 64%, respectively. The Committee noted that the 5-year DFS was higher for all patients who have localised disease when compared with those who have metastatic disease (76% versus 28%, <em>P</em>=0.001) (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ans.12429"" target=""_blank"">Siu et al.

The Committee noted that nearly all patients will become resistant to imatinib, with 40% to 50% of patients developing resistance and experiencing disease progression within 2 years, largely driven by secondary receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) mutations. The Committee noted that once a patient progresses on sunitinib, best supportive care is provided, and that conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not effective in this population with advanced disease. The Committee noted that regorafenib is also approved by Medsafe for the treatment of advanced unresectable or metastatic GIST but is not commercially available in New Zealand, nor has Pharmac received a funding application for this medicine.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a cross-sectional study reporting that caregivers of those with GIST who had been treated with TKIs experience high levels of burden (10%) and distress (23%). The Committee noted that caregivers with high levels of burden perceived significantly lower mental health, less vitality, lower general health, and high levels of distress. The Committee noted that caregivers with high levels of distress perceived significantly more burden, lower social functioning, more role physical and emotional problems, lower mental health, less vitality, and lower general health (<a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0284186X.2018.1518592"" target=""_blank"">Langenberg et al.

The Committee considered that the evidence from the INVICTUS trial investigates the use of ripretinib in the fourth line, whereas this funding application proposes use of ripretinib in the third line, and that therefore a longer PFS would be expected if ripretinib were to be used in an earlier line. The Committee considered that the available evidence supports the use of ripretinib dose escalation after disease progression, and there is limited evidence on how outcomes may change if ripretinib was not permitted to be used after the first sign of disease progression. </p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that OS in the placebo arm of the INVICTUS trial was confounded by crossover from the ripretinib arm and considered that there is limited follow-up data for this study to further investigate this. The Committee considered that this resulted in the benefit of ripretinib being underestimated in the reported outcomes, and the that the OS benefit is likely to be greater than that observed. The Committee also noted that among those randomised to placebo, median OS was 11.6 months among those who crossed over to ripretinib upon progression, compared to 1.8 months for those who did not cross over. The Committee considered that those who did not cross over were likely a selected subgroup of individuals for whom ripretinib was not suitable, and that this does not represent outcomes for all patients treated with placebo. The Committee considered that median OS with placebo was likely to be somewhere between the OS of those who did not cross over (1.8 months) and the OS of the intention-to-treat population (6.3 months). </p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence demonstrates that ripretinib provides a health benefit in terms of PFS accompanied by improved overall wellbeing. The Committee considered that the quality-of-life improvements observed in patients would have a flow on impact to whānau and the community. The Committee considered that ripretinib has relatively few side effects requiring hospital admission.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ripretinib is an oral medication that is administered once daily at approximately the same time each day. The Committee noted that tablets should be swallowed whole with water, which may be challenging for those who have difficulty with swallowing medicines. The Committee noted that the oral formulation and straightforward dosing regimen may otherwise support adherence. The Committee noted that, as it can be self-administered by the individual or a caregiver in the community, the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility would be minimised.</p><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if ripretinib were to be funded, approximately 90% of those who initiate sunitinib would require ripretinib due to either disease progression of intolerable side effects. The Committee considered that individuals receiving ripretinib dose escalation upon disease progression would need to be of good performance status and that it is unlikely individuals would continue the escalated dose beyond second progression.

The Committee considered that ripretinib would also likely delay time to hospitalisation for those with advanced GIST due to the associated PFS benefit and quality of life benefit. The Committee noted that in the INVICTUS trial, patients were assessed fortnightly initially and then once every four weeks and considered this to be an appropriate estimate of health resource utilisation for people with advanced GIST. The Committee considered that those eligible to receive ripretinib will also require supportive care medications for the management of disease- or treatment-related symptoms (eg diarrhoea and nausea).</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the Pharmac estimate of 13 people per year who had progressed following prior sunitinib.

The Committee also noted that of the group managed in Auckland, two were Māori and two were of Pacific ethnicity, suggesting a disproportionate impact across ethnicities.

The Committee considered that the evidence from the INVICTUS trial investigates the use of ripretinib in the fourth line, whereas this funding application proposes use of ripretinib in the third line, and that therefore a longer PFS would be expected if ripretinib were to be used in an earlier line. The Committee considered that the available evidence supports the use of ripretinib dose escalation after disease progression, and there is limited evidence on how outcomes may change if ripretinib was not permitted to be used after the first sign of disease progression. </p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that OS in the placebo arm of the INVICTUS trial was confounded by crossover from the ripretinib arm and considered that there is limited follow-up data for this study to further investigate this. The Committee considered that this resulted in the benefit of ripretinib being underestimated in the reported outcomes, and the that the OS benefit is likely to be greater than that observed. The Committee also noted that among those randomised to placebo, median OS was 11.6 months among those who crossed over to ripretinib upon progression, compared to 1.8 months for those who did not cross over. The Committee considered that those who did not cross over were likely a selected subgroup of individuals for whom ripretinib was not suitable, and that this does not represent outcomes for all patients treated with placebo. The Committee considered that median OS with placebo was likely to be somewhere between the OS of those who did not cross over (1.8 months) and the OS of the intention-to-treat population (6.3 months). </p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence demonstrates that ripretinib provides a health benefit in terms of PFS accompanied by improved overall wellbeing. The Committee considered that the quality-of-life improvements observed in patients would have a flow on impact to whānau and the community. The Committee considered that ripretinib has relatively few side effects requiring hospital admission.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>1.20.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that ripretinib is an oral medication that is administered once daily at approximately the same time each day. The Committee noted that tablets should be swallowed whole with water, which may be challenging for those who have difficulty with swallowing medicines. The Committee noted that the oral formulation and straightforward dosing regimen may otherwise support adherence. The Committee noted that, as it can be self-administered by the individual or a caregiver in the community, the burden of treatment delivery and need for repeated attendance at a hospital or outpatient facility would be minimised.</p><h3><em>Cost and Savings</em></h3><p>1.21.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that, if ripretinib were to be funded, approximately 90% of those who initiate sunitinib would require ripretinib due to either disease progression of intolerable side effects. The Committee considered that individuals receiving ripretinib dose escalation upon disease progression would need to be of good performance status and that it is unlikely individuals would continue the escalated dose beyond second progression. The Committee noted there was little information about whether any patients in INVICTUS continued receiving the 150 mg daily dose after first progression. </p><p>1.22.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that funding ripretinib would result in the eligible population living longer, thereby increasing clinician follow up and imaging appointments to monitor disease activities. The Committee considered that ripretinib would also likely delay time to hospitalisation for those with advanced GIST due to the associated PFS benefit and quality of life benefit. The Committee noted that in the INVICTUS trial, patients were assessed fortnightly initially and then once every four weeks and considered this to be an appropriate estimate of health resource utilisation for people with advanced GIST. The Committee considered that those eligible to receive ripretinib will also require supportive care medications for the management of disease- or treatment-related symptoms (eg diarrhoea and nausea).</p><p>1.23.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted the Pharmac estimate of 13 people per year who had progressed following prior sunitinib. The Committee considered that there were five individuals managed in Auckland alone over the last three months who would meet the proposed Special Authority criteria, suggesting that the treatment group may be larger than this. The Committee also noted that of the group managed in Auckland, two were Māori and two were of Pacific ethnicity, suggesting a disproportionate impact across ethnicities. The Committee considered Pharmac should further interrogate the data to refine these numbers. </p><h3><em>Summary for Assessment</em></h3><p>1.24.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for ripretinib if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of advanced or metastatic unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) that have progressed following treatment with imatinib and sunitinib.

The Committee considered that the evidence from the INVICTUS trial investigates the use of ripretinib in the fourth line, whereas this funding application proposes use of ripretinib in the third line, and that therefore a longer PFS would be expected if ripretinib were to be used in an earlier line. The Committee considered that the available evidence supports the use of ripretinib dose escalation after disease progression, and there is limited evidence on how outcomes may change if ripretinib was not permitted to be used after the first sign of disease progression. </p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that OS in the placebo arm of the INVICTUS trial was confounded by crossover from the ripretinib arm and considered that there is limited follow-up data for this study to further investigate this. The Committee considered that this resulted in the benefit of ripretinib being underestimated in the reported outcomes, and the that the OS benefit is likely to be greater than that observed. The Committee also noted that among those randomised to placebo, median OS was 11.6 months among those who crossed over to ripretinib upon progression, compared to 1.8 months for those who did not cross over. The Committee considered that those who did not cross over were likely a selected subgroup of individuals for whom ripretinib was not suitable, and that this does not represent outcomes for all patients treated with placebo. The Committee considered that median OS with placebo was likely to be somewhere between the OS of those who did not cross over (1.8 months) and the OS of the intention-to-treat population (6.3 months). </p><p>1.19.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence demonstrates that ripretinib provides a health benefit in terms of PFS accompanied by improved overall wellbeing.

The Committee considered that individuals receiving ripretinib dose escalation upon disease progression would need to be of good performance status and that it is unlikely individuals would continue the escalated dose beyond second progression.

The Committee noted that in the INVICTUS trial, patients were assessed fortnightly initially and then once every four weeks and considered this to be an appropriate estimate of health resource utilisation for people with advanced GIST.
