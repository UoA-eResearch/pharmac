This advice was sought by PHARMAC staff to assist in the Committee\u2019s review of the application due to the specialised requirements of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU).</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that PTAC considered a funding application for sapropterin for the treatment of patients with PKU at risk of cognitive impairment in <a href=\"https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2018-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2018</a>. The Committee noted that at this time, PTAC recommended that PHARMAC consider broadening the range of dietary options and PKU supplements available on the Pharmaceutical Schedule. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that PKU is an autosomal inborn error of metabolism in which a deficiency or mutation in phenylalanine hydroxylase results in the inability to metabolize phenylalanine. The Committee noted that the degree of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency can vary among individuals with PKU and that the amount of residual phenylalanine hydroxylase activity dictates the severity of the resulting disorder.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that there are approximately 160 patients known to have PKU in New Zealand, and that dispensing data suggests that 105 patients are receiving supplements for PKU (79 of these on a regular basis).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that a restrictive diet low in phenylalanine is the cornerstone of management for PKU. The Committee noted that this requires patients to severely restrict the intake of all foods containing protein and to use supplements to ensure there is adequate intake of the other essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. </p><p><br></p><p>The Committee considered that dietary management of PKU is complex and difficult to maintain. The Committee considered that this can also be burdensome on the family and caregivers of children and adolescents with PKU (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27622144\" target=\"_blank\">MacDonald et al.

The Committee noted that GMP is a whole protein derived from whey that does not contain phenylalanine.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted that the process of extracting and refining GMP results in the inclusion of trace quantities of phenylalanine in the supplements; however, the Committee considered that these amounts would have minimal impact for the majority of patients with PKU.</p><p><br></p><p>The Committee noted evidence for GMP-containing supplements provided by the following studies:</p><ul><li>A two-stage, randomised crossover trial which investigated the efficacy and safety of a low-phenylalanine diet combined with GMP-medical foods or amino acid-medical foods in 30 subjects with early-treated PKU (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27413125\" target=\"_blank\">Ney et al.
