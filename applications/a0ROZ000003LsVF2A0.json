The Committee noted that the most common symptoms include bone pain, fractures, joint pain, pruritus, or rash, and that prolonged hyperphosphataemia in CKD patients can lead to cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease, and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The Committee noted that these symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, which worsens with increasing CKD severity grade, and is significantly influenced by age, gender, diabetes and history of cardiovascular co-morbidities (<a href=\"https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/4/8/1293.long\" target=\"_blank\">Mujais et al.

The Committee noted that hyperphosphataemia is considered inevitable among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) due to the extent of renal impairment associated with this condition and is present in the majority of dialysis patients (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815538246?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Hutchison. Kidney Int. 2009;75:906-14</a>), therefore adjunct treatment with a phosphate-binding agent is generally required (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815508041?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Achinger et al. Kidney International. 2005;67:S28-S32</a>). The Committee noted that dialysis patients in general are in extremely poor health, with significantly reduced survival relative to the general population. Overall, the Committee considered there is a high health need for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) reported that there were 2,855 patients (2000 on haemodialysis, 855 on peritoneal dialysis) receiving dialysis in New Zealand in 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>).<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\"> </span>The Committee noted that ANZDATA survival data is not stratified by the presence of hyperphosphataemia, however, between 75% and 90% of patients on dialysis are treated with phosphate binders, suggesting that approximately 2,500 individuals on dialysis will receive treatment for hyperphosphataemia each year in New Zealand (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195858\" target=\"_blank\">St Peter, et al.

The Committee considered this patient estimate to be appropriate. The Committee also noted that ANZDATA estimates a median survival of between 7.6 years (in patients aged 25 to 44) to 1.7 years (in patients aged 85 and above) among dialysis patients in New Zealand between 2010 to 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CKD disproportionally affects M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al.

The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also experience a higher incidence of diabetic and hypertensive ESRD, which cannot be fully explained by the underlying CKD prevalence (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al. Semin Nephrol. 2019;39:297-299</a>). The Committee also noted that between 2015 and 2019 M\u0101ori people were three to four times more likely to be on dialysis than non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific peoples (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>). The Committee noted that other factors that may contribute to this difference in incidence are socio-economic disadvantage, which is a known risk factor for ESRD, and underutilisation of medical services (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al. Semin Nephrol. 2019;39:297-299</a>).<b> </b>The Committee also noted that Pacific peoples, people living in rural and remote areas, as well as people with a low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by CKD and in turn hyperphosphataemia. Members considered that access to medication may also influence the outcomes in these patient populations.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hyperphosphataemia in patients with CKD and on dialysis is currently treated with phosphate-binding agents in conjunction with dietary phosphate restriction or limiting dietary phosphate intake alone. The Committee noted that there are two phosphate binding products funded in New Zealand: aluminium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, however, aluminium hydroxide is not recommended as there are concerns regarding the toxicity of absorbed aluminium. The Committee noted that other treatments that are not currently funded in New Zealand include sevelamer (hydrochloride and carbonate), calcium acetate, lanthanum carbonate, and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313253/\" target=\"_blank\">Chan et al. Aust Prescri. 2017;40:10-14</a>). Given the currently funded treatment options, the Committee considered that there may be an unmet health need for those who are contraindicated to using or inadequately controlled on calcium carbonate, however, were unsure of the number of individuals this would apply to.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder that forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/ProductDetail.asp?ID=20148\" target=\"_blank\">lanthanum carbonate is Medsafe approved</a> for the treatment of CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia on dialysis. The Committee noted that dosing is individualised to achieve acceptable serum phosphate levels, with a recommended starting dose of 750mg daily, titrated every 2-3 weeks up to a maximum of 3750mg daily, and that most patients will require a dose of between 1500mg to 3000mg daily.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the key evidence for lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with CKD comes from four clinical trials:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the NCT01578200 (Ogata 2021) trial was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial which investigated lanthanum carbonate compared to calcium carbonate in 2309 patients with CKD, hyperphosphataemia, and one or more risk factors for vascular calcification. The Committee noted that after a median duration of follow up of 3.16 years, composite cardiovascular events occurred in 13.8% of those in the lanthanum carbonate group versus 12.5% of those in the calcium carbonate group, and overall there was no significant difference in all cause death (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\">Ogata et al.

The Committee noted that after four weeks of randomised crossover treatment, serum phosphorus levels had decreased by 1.7 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a decrease of 1.4 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the sevelamer hydrochloride group. The Committee noted that serum calcium had a mean increase of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a mean decrease of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the sevelamer carbonate group (P=0.025), and that intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) had a mean increase of 296.1 \u00b1 16.4pg/mL in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a mean increase of 286.9 \u00b1 16.4pg/mL in the sevelamer hydrochloride group (P=0.552) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19825330/\" target=\"_blank\">Sprague et al.

The Committee noted that after 12 months of treatment, 14.5% of the lanthanum carbonate group showed decreased coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores versus 28.3% in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group, however that there was no significant difference in percentage change in CAC between the two groups. The Committee noted that serum phosphate levels had decreased by 0.57 \u00b1 1.45mg/dL in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a decrease of 0.82 \u00b1 1.33mg/dL in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33547218/\" target=\"_blank\">Isaka et al.

The Committee noted that in the Ogata 2021 trial, 25.7% of patients in the lanthanum carbonate group experienced GI-related side effects versus 23.4% in the calcium carbonate group. The Committee noted that other common adverse effects included infections and infestations (16.0% versus 13.9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (14.5% versus 17.0%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.6% versus 18.5%) in the lanthanum carbonate and calcium carbonate groups respectively.

The Committee noted that PTAC and the Nephrology Advisory Committee both recommended the application be declined due to poor quality evidence and safety concerns. At that time, PTAC and the Nephrology Advisory Committee noted that the carbonate formulation of sevelamer could have a better safety profile than the hydrochloride formulation and suggested that a funding application for sevelamer carbonate be submitted.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate was received from Sanofi in August 2016. The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is currently under assessment, and that the Nephrology Advisory Committee recommended the application for medium priority, and PTAC recommended the application for low priority.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hyperphosphataemia is defined as having serum phosphorous levels of greater than 1.46mmol/L (&gt;4.5mg/dL), which may present as clinically asymptomatic or symptomatic. The Committee noted that the most common symptoms include bone pain, fractures, joint pain, pruritus, or rash, and that prolonged hyperphosphataemia in CKD patients can lead to cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease, and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The Committee noted that these symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, which worsens with increasing CKD severity grade, and is significantly influenced by age, gender, diabetes and history of cardiovascular co-morbidities (<a href=\"https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/4/8/1293.long\" target=\"_blank\">Mujais et al.

The Committee noted that hyperphosphataemia is considered inevitable among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) due to the extent of renal impairment associated with this condition and is present in the majority of dialysis patients (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815538246?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Hutchison. Kidney Int. 2009;75:906-14</a>), therefore adjunct treatment with a phosphate-binding agent is generally required (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815508041?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Achinger et al. Kidney International. 2005;67:S28-S32</a>). The Committee noted that dialysis patients in general are in extremely poor health, with significantly reduced survival relative to the general population. Overall, the Committee considered there is a high health need for this patient group.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) reported that there were 2,855 patients (2000 on haemodialysis, 855 on peritoneal dialysis) receiving dialysis in New Zealand in 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>).<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\"> </span>The Committee noted that ANZDATA survival data is not stratified by the presence of hyperphosphataemia, however, between 75% and 90% of patients on dialysis are treated with phosphate binders, suggesting that approximately 2,500 individuals on dialysis will receive treatment for hyperphosphataemia each year in New Zealand (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195858\" target=\"_blank\">St Peter, et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2018;71:246-53</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901075/\" target=\"_blank\">Lopes et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2012;60:90-101</a>). The Committee considered this patient estimate to be appropriate. The Committee also noted that ANZDATA estimates a median survival of between 7.6 years (in patients aged 25 to 44) to 1.7 years (in patients aged 85 and above) among dialysis patients in New Zealand between 2010 to 2019 (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that CKD disproportionally affects M\u0101ori (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al. Semin Nephrol. 2019;39:297-299</a>), which was previously acknowledged by PTAC in their evaluation of sevelamer carbonate (<a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptrP/p000099\" target=\"_blank\">August 2019 PTAC minutes, paragraph 11.9</a>). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also experience a higher incidence of diabetic and hypertensive ESRD, which cannot be fully explained by the underlying CKD prevalence (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al. Semin Nephrol. 2019;39:297-299</a>). The Committee also noted that between 2015 and 2019 M\u0101ori people were three to four times more likely to be on dialysis than non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific peoples (<a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">ANZDATA 43</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">rd</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-43rd-annual-report-2020-data-to-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"> Annual Report 2020</a>). The Committee noted that other factors that may contribute to this difference in incidence are socio-economic disadvantage, which is a known risk factor for ESRD, and underutilisation of medical services (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0270-9295(19)30017-8\" target=\"_blank\">Walker 2019 et al. Semin Nephrol. 2019;39:297-299</a>).<b> </b>The Committee also noted that Pacific peoples, people living in rural and remote areas, as well as people with a low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by CKD and in turn hyperphosphataemia. Members considered that access to medication may also influence the outcomes in these patient populations.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.14.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that hyperphosphataemia in patients with CKD and on dialysis is currently treated with phosphate-binding agents in conjunction with dietary phosphate restriction or limiting dietary phosphate intake alone. The Committee noted that there are two phosphate binding products funded in New Zealand: aluminium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, however, aluminium hydroxide is not recommended as there are concerns regarding the toxicity of absorbed aluminium. The Committee noted that other treatments that are not currently funded in New Zealand include sevelamer (hydrochloride and carbonate), calcium acetate, lanthanum carbonate, and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313253/\" target=\"_blank\">Chan et al. Aust Prescri. 2017;40:10-14</a>). Given the currently funded treatment options, the Committee considered that there may be an unmet health need for those who are contraindicated to using or inadequately controlled on calcium carbonate, however, were unsure of the number of individuals this would apply to.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.15.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder that forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that <a href=\"https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/ProductDetail.asp?ID=20148\" target=\"_blank\">lanthanum carbonate is Medsafe approved</a> for the treatment of CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia on dialysis. The Committee noted that dosing is individualised to achieve acceptable serum phosphate levels, with a recommended starting dose of 750mg daily, titrated every 2-3 weeks up to a maximum of 3750mg daily, and that most patients will require a dose of between 1500mg to 3000mg daily.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.16.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the key evidence for lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with CKD comes from four clinical trials:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the NCT01578200 (Ogata 2021) trial was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial which investigated lanthanum carbonate compared to calcium carbonate in 2309 patients with CKD, hyperphosphataemia, and one or more risk factors for vascular calcification. The Committee noted that after a median duration of follow up of 3.16 years, composite cardiovascular events occurred in 13.8% of those in the lanthanum carbonate group versus 12.5% of those in the calcium carbonate group, and overall there was no significant difference in all cause death (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021;18:1946-1954.</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the NCT00441545 (Sprague 2009) trial was a prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised, cross-over study which investigated lanthanum carbonate compared to sevelamer hydrochloride in 182 patients with CKD undergoing stable haemodialysis 2-3 times weekly for at least two months. The Committee noted that after four weeks of randomised crossover treatment, serum phosphorus levels had decreased by 1.7 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a decrease of 1.4 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the sevelamer hydrochloride group. The Committee noted that serum calcium had a mean increase of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a mean decrease of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1mg/dl in the sevelamer carbonate group (P=0.025), and that intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) had a mean increase of 296.1 \u00b1 16.4pg/mL in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a mean increase of 286.9 \u00b1 16.4pg/mL in the sevelamer hydrochloride group (P=0.552) (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19825330/\" target=\"_blank\">Sprague et al. Clin Nephrol. 2009;72:252-258.</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the Kasai 2012 trial is a prospective, randomised, open blinded, endpoint (PROBE), crossover study which investigated lanthanum carbonate compared to sevelamer hydrochloride in 41 patients undergoing haemodialysis for at least three months. The Committee noted that after 13 weeks of randomised crossover treatment, the mean difference in serum phosphate was \u22120.3mg/dL (95% CI not reached [NR]; P=0.09), the mean difference in serum calcium was 0.1mg/dL (95% CI NR; P=0.47), and the mean difference in iPTH was 14.3pg/mL (95% CI NR; P=0.48), where a mean difference of &lt;0 favours lanthanum carbonate (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22817122/\" target=\"_blank\">Kasai et al. Ther Apher Dial. 2012; 16:341-349.</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the EPISODE trial is a randomised, open label, multicentre, interventional trial which investigated lanthanum carbonate compared to sucroferric oxyhydroxide in 160 patients on dialysis. The Committee noted that after 12 months of treatment, 14.5% of the lanthanum carbonate group showed decreased coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores versus 28.3% in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group, however that there was no significant difference in percentage change in CAC between the two groups. The Committee noted that serum phosphate levels had decreased by 0.57 \u00b1 1.45mg/dL in the lanthanum carbonate group versus a decrease of 0.82 \u00b1 1.33mg/dL in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33547218/\" target=\"_blank\">Isaka et al. J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021;32:723-735.</a>).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.16.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that the adverse events reported across the various trials were predominantly GI-related. The Committee noted that in the Ogata 2021 trial, 25.7% of patients in the lanthanum carbonate group experienced GI-related side effects versus 23.4% in the calcium carbonate group. The Committee noted that other common adverse effects included infections and infestations (16.0% versus 13.9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (14.5% versus 17.0%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.6% versus 18.5%) in the lanthanum carbonate and calcium carbonate groups respectively. The Committee also noted that the lanthanum carbonate group had a higher risk of cardiovascular death (HR 1.51) and a higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.10) than the calcium carbonate group. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021;18:1946-1954.</a>).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.17.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee considered that the evidence provided shows that lanthanum carbonate does not provide a strong additional health benefit over the comparators investigated. The Committee considered the following during their critical appraisal of the evidence:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.17.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee considered that the Ogata 2021 trial provided strong quality of evidence, however that this evidence showed numerically worse outcomes in lanthanum carbonate compared to calcium carbonate.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.17.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee considered that the results of the Sprague 2009 trial showed that both lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride reduce phosphate levels, but that neither treatment was superior.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">7.17.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee considered that although the EPISODE and Kasai 2012 trials showed that lanthanum carbonate provided a moderate improvement versus comparators, they are of weak quality and have poor generalisation to the New Zealand population. The Committee considered that the results of these studies are difficult to translate to the New Zealand population as both trials were conducted in a Japanese population with low rates of diabetes, and the comparators (sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer hydrochloride) are not currently available treatments in New Zealand. Additionally, the Committee considered that the outcome measured in the EPISODE trial (percentage change in CAC score) is difficult to interpret in terms of clinically meaningful outcomes in the New Zealand setting in people with ESRD, and that the small population size in the Kasai 2012 trial (n=41) leads to low statistical power.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.18.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee was made aware of the ongoing PHOSPHATE trial: A randomised, interventional trial investigating whether reduction of serum phosphate concentration toward the normal level with phosphate-lowering medications reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or non-fatal major cardiovascular events; improves physical health, fatigue, and patient satisfaction in kidney failure patients receiving dialysis; and is cost-effective. The Committee noted that the trial includes 3600 participants in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and UK (600 in Australia and New Zealand) with kidney failure and on dialysis aged over 45 years or over 18 years with diabetes (<a href=\"https://aktn.org.au/phosphate-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">Australasia Kidney Trials Network</a>). The Committee considered it would be appropriate to follow the results of this trial to help inform future funding decisions in this area.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is provided as a chewable tablet, and therefore provides a suitability benefit for patients with swallowing difficulties and those with restricted fluid intake. The Committee noted that there is currently no Medsafe-approved chewable tablet for sevelamer carbonate, therefore lanthanum carbonate also provides benefit over this product.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is more expensive than calcium carbonate, with no additional health benefit over this currently available treatment. The Committee considered that there may be changes in health sector expenditure, however that it was not possible to accurately define what these would be compared to currently funded treatments. The Committee also considered that the uptake of lanthanum carbonate would be the patient group who are uncontrolled on calcium carbonate.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">7.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\"> </span>The Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for lanthanum carbonate if it were to be funded in New Zealand for CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.\u00a0</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ0000099jTs&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000001tsjn\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",

The Committee noted that there are inequities in the incidence and prevalence of kidney failure, and treatment practices in kidney replacement therapy for M\u0101ori compared to non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific people population in New Zealand. The Committee noted that M\u0101ori have a substantially higher rate of type 2 diabetic nephropathy causing kidney failure, and are significantly less likely to receive a kidney transplant, and more likely to initiate dialysis with haemodialysis, M\u0101ori are provided with facility-based dialysis as the principal modality of care, with a lower provision of home-based modalities compared with non-M\u0101ori, non-Pacific peoples (</span><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. 44</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 9px;\">th</a><a href=\"https://www.anzdata.org.au/report/anzdata-44th-annual-report-2021-data-to-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> Annual Report.2021</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">). The Committee noted that M\u0101ori also have significantly lower rates of kidney transplantation prior to requiring dialysis. The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence of differences in hyperphosphataemia between ethnicities.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Background</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with CKD, receiving dialysis and whose phosphate serum levels cannot be controlled on calcium carbonate was previously reviewed by </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> in November 2021 where PTAC recommended the application be declined and considered that the evidence available at the time was consistent with only a modest clinically meaningful health benefit, with some difficulty in translating this into the New Zealand setting, and the high-quality evidence demonstrates no benefit of lanthanum carbonate over calcium carbonate. The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018. The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-nephrology-subcommittee-minutes-2018-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2018</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">, it recommended that sevelamer carbonate to be listed with a medium priority on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for individuals who are on dialysis and expected to be on dialysis for at least 12-months, currently taking a calcium-based binding agent and with a phosphate level equal or greater than 4.5 mmol/L2.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptrP/p000099\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2019, PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> recommended that sevelamer carbonate be funded with a low priority for the management of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis subject to Special Authority criteria. The Committee noted that, at that time PTAC requested that advice be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the Special Authority criteria, in particular whether eligibility should include CT coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores to identify those at greatest need. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Need</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia describes an individual\u2019s measured serum phosphate levels being greater than 4.5mg/dL (1.46mol/L). The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate. The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia in CKD is associated with cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that dialysis commonly inadequately controls serum phosphorus. The Committee noted that individuals on dialysis are often treated with phosphate-binding agents.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the currently available treatment for hyperphosphataemia secondary to CKD are calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide. The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia. The Committee considered that the benefits/harms of phosphate binders are likely to be the same between these two groups. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Benefit</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder, which forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (</span><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">NG203</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis. The Committee noted that this guideline discussed and interpreted the evidence and made recommendations for a combined population of individuals with stage 5 CKD on dialysis and stage 4 or 5 CKD not on dialysis. The Committee noted that this guidance document commented on the lack of credible mortality data available. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis presented in NG203 compared eleven different treatments, including those currently funded in New Zealand, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate. The Committee noted that there was not a clinically significant difference between any of the agents in reducing phosphate levels, and that treatments varied in their efficacy at different time points. The Committee considered the quality of evidence included in the network meta-analysis to be of low quality. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that calcium carbonate treatment increases calcium in the blood, but considered that this is not necessarily harmful to individuals receiving treatment unless calcium levels are already high (i.e. hypercalcaemia). The Committee noted that in this instance, calcium containing binders would likely not be used. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee note the LANDMARK trial (</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021; 18:1946-1954</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">)\u00a0where individuals with CKD, hyperphosphatasaemia and at least one factor of vascular calcification were randomised to receive either lanthanum carbonate (n = 1154) or calcium carbonate (n = 1155) and titrated to achieve serum phosphate levels of between 3.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia). Following 3.16 years cardiovascular events occurred in 147 of 1063 patients in the lanthanum calcium group and 134 of 1072 patients in the calcium carbonate group (incidence rate, 4.80 vs 4.30 per 100 person-years; difference 0.50 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.57 to 1.56]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95%, CI, 0.88 to 1.41], P = 0.37). There were no significant differences in all-cause death (difference, 0.43 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.63 to 1.49]; HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.37]; P = 0.42). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the available evidence does not suggest lanthanum is likely to significantly reduce mortality or the number of cardiovascular events. The Committee considered that mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, and vascular calcification outcomes are clinically important to consider for individuals with CKD but considered that there is no strong evidence to inform how and to what degree this is impacted by lowering phosphate. However, the Committee considered that lowering phosphate was clinically desirable and that lanthanum would be a useful additional option for clinicians.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the context of the applications for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate was to include these agents as alternatives to current treatments and not necessarily as a replacement. The Committee considered that for the majority, lanthanum would be combined with calcium-phosphate binders. The Committee noted that there is no data relating to the benefit of the addition of these agents into regiments with currently funded phosphate lowering binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the </span><a href=\"https://aktn.org.au/phosphate-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PHOSPHATE</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> study, currently being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand, and noted that hard outcomes relating to any benefits for lowering phosphate in individuals with CKD may be clearer following publication of results from this study.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would not replace current treatment for many individuals with hyperphosphataemia but would rather be in addition to their current treatment. The Committee considered that funding these treatments would add to already significant \u201cpill burden\u201d experienced by these individuals. However, the Committee considered that the impact of this is unclear and that if all medications were to be taken at the same time of day (ie three times daily with meals) adherence may not be impacted.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Cost and savings</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that use of aluminium hydroxide in New Zealand would almost exclusively be for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, and not use as antacid treatment. The Committee considered that individuals from this group are likely to access sevelamer or lanthanum as both medications can be utilised as an add-on to calcium or aluminium based binders or replacement therapy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the number of individuals with chronic renal failure potentially requiring treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would be two to three times the number of individuals receiving dialysis. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that there would be a subset of patients currently receiving aluminium hydroxide who would switch over to lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate due to the potential toxicities associated with aluminium but considered that this number would be small.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The </span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate if it were to be funded in New Zealand for hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD.

The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence of differences in hyperphosphataemia between ethnicities.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Background</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with CKD, receiving dialysis and whose phosphate serum levels cannot be controlled on calcium carbonate was previously reviewed by </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> in November 2021 where PTAC recommended the application be declined and considered that the evidence available at the time was consistent with only a modest clinically meaningful health benefit, with some difficulty in translating this into the New Zealand setting, and the high-quality evidence demonstrates no benefit of lanthanum carbonate over calcium carbonate. The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018. The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-nephrology-subcommittee-minutes-2018-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2018</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">, it recommended that sevelamer carbonate to be listed with a medium priority on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for individuals who are on dialysis and expected to be on dialysis for at least 12-months, currently taking a calcium-based binding agent and with a phosphate level equal or greater than 4.5 mmol/L2.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptrP/p000099\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2019, PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> recommended that sevelamer carbonate be funded with a low priority for the management of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis subject to Special Authority criteria. The Committee noted that, at that time PTAC requested that advice be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the Special Authority criteria, in particular whether eligibility should include CT coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores to identify those at greatest need. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Need</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia describes an individual\u2019s measured serum phosphate levels being greater than 4.5mg/dL (1.46mol/L). The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate. The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia in CKD is associated with cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that dialysis commonly inadequately controls serum phosphorus. The Committee noted that individuals on dialysis are often treated with phosphate-binding agents.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the currently available treatment for hyperphosphataemia secondary to CKD are calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide. The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia. The Committee considered that the benefits/harms of phosphate binders are likely to be the same between these two groups. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Benefit</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder, which forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (</span><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">NG203</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis. The Committee noted that this guideline discussed and interpreted the evidence and made recommendations for a combined population of individuals with stage 5 CKD on dialysis and stage 4 or 5 CKD not on dialysis. The Committee noted that this guidance document commented on the lack of credible mortality data available. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis presented in NG203 compared eleven different treatments, including those currently funded in New Zealand, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate. The Committee noted that there was not a clinically significant difference between any of the agents in reducing phosphate levels, and that treatments varied in their efficacy at different time points. The Committee considered the quality of evidence included in the network meta-analysis to be of low quality. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that calcium carbonate treatment increases calcium in the blood, but considered that this is not necessarily harmful to individuals receiving treatment unless calcium levels are already high (i.e. hypercalcaemia). The Committee noted that in this instance, calcium containing binders would likely not be used. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee note the LANDMARK trial (</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021; 18:1946-1954</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">)\u00a0where individuals with CKD, hyperphosphatasaemia and at least one factor of vascular calcification were randomised to receive either lanthanum carbonate (n = 1154) or calcium carbonate (n = 1155) and titrated to achieve serum phosphate levels of between 3.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia). Following 3.16 years cardiovascular events occurred in 147 of 1063 patients in the lanthanum calcium group and 134 of 1072 patients in the calcium carbonate group (incidence rate, 4.80 vs 4.30 per 100 person-years; difference 0.50 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.57 to 1.56]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95%, CI, 0.88 to 1.41], P = 0.37). There were no significant differences in all-cause death (difference, 0.43 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.63 to 1.49]; HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.37]; P = 0.42). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the available evidence does not suggest lanthanum is likely to significantly reduce mortality or the number of cardiovascular events. The Committee considered that mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, and vascular calcification outcomes are clinically important to consider for individuals with CKD but considered that there is no strong evidence to inform how and to what degree this is impacted by lowering phosphate. However, the Committee considered that lowering phosphate was clinically desirable and that lanthanum would be a useful additional option for clinicians.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the context of the applications for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate was to include these agents as alternatives to current treatments and not necessarily as a replacement. The Committee considered that for the majority, lanthanum would be combined with calcium-phosphate binders. The Committee noted that there is no data relating to the benefit of the addition of these agents into regiments with currently funded phosphate lowering binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the </span><a href=\"https://aktn.org.au/phosphate-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PHOSPHATE</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> study, currently being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand, and noted that hard outcomes relating to any benefits for lowering phosphate in individuals with CKD may be clearer following publication of results from this study.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would not replace current treatment for many individuals with hyperphosphataemia but would rather be in addition to their current treatment. The Committee considered that funding these treatments would add to already significant \u201cpill burden\u201d experienced by these individuals. However, the Committee considered that the impact of this is unclear and that if all medications were to be taken at the same time of day (ie three times daily with meals) adherence may not be impacted.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Cost and savings</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that use of aluminium hydroxide in New Zealand would almost exclusively be for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, and not use as antacid treatment. The Committee considered that individuals from this group are likely to access sevelamer or lanthanum as both medications can be utilised as an add-on to calcium or aluminium based binders or replacement therapy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the number of individuals with chronic renal failure potentially requiring treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would be two to three times the number of individuals receiving dialysis. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that there would be a subset of patients currently receiving aluminium hydroxide who would switch over to lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate due to the potential toxicities associated with aluminium but considered that this number would be small.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The </span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate if it were to be funded in New Zealand for hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD.

The Committee noted that there is no direct evidence of differences in hyperphosphataemia between ethnicities.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Background</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with CKD, receiving dialysis and whose phosphate serum levels cannot be controlled on calcium carbonate was previously reviewed by </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-11-PTAC-meeting-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> in November 2021 where PTAC recommended the application be declined and considered that the evidence available at the time was consistent with only a modest clinically meaningful health benefit, with some difficulty in translating this into the New Zealand setting, and the high-quality evidence demonstrates no benefit of lanthanum carbonate over calcium carbonate. The Committee noted that PTAC requested advice from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the health benefit of lanthanum carbonate versus sevelamer carbonate, and whether there is a subgroup of individuals who would benefit from lanthanum carbonate, such as those contraindicated to using, or refractory to, calcium carbonate, including patient number estimates for this population.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that an application for sevelamer carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia experienced by adult individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and are receiving dialysis has previously been discussed by the Nephrology Subcommittee (now the Nephrology Advisory Committee) in 2018. The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-nephrology-subcommittee-minutes-2018-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2018</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">, it recommended that sevelamer carbonate to be listed with a medium priority on the Pharmaceutical Schedule for individuals who are on dialysis and expected to be on dialysis for at least 12-months, currently taking a calcium-based binding agent and with a phosphate level equal or greater than 4.5 mmol/L2.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that, in </span><a href=\"https://connect.pharmac.govt.nz/apptracker/s/application-public/a102P000008ptrP/p000099\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2019, PTAC</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> recommended that sevelamer carbonate be funded with a low priority for the management of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis subject to Special Authority criteria. The Committee noted that, at that time PTAC requested that advice be sought from the Nephrology Advisory Committee regarding the Special Authority criteria, in particular whether eligibility should include CT coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores to identify those at greatest need. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Need</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia describes an individual\u2019s measured serum phosphate levels being greater than 4.5mg/dL (1.46mol/L). The Committee noted that daily phosphate load is largely excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hyperphosphatemia occurs when renal function is impaired to the extent that reduced renal phosphate excretion and other homeostatic mechanisms fail to eliminate the excess phosphate. The Committee noted that hyperphosphatemia in CKD is associated with cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that dialysis commonly inadequately controls serum phosphorus. The Committee noted that individuals on dialysis are often treated with phosphate-binding agents.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the currently available treatment for hyperphosphataemia secondary to CKD are calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide. The Committee noted that individuals with progressive CKD are treated with phosphate binders before they reach dialysis. The Committee noted that a minority of individuals receiving treatment with aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia would experience some adverse events and toxicity and considered that this would not be common. The Committee also noted that aluminium is partially absorbed by the body and is excreted through the kidneys, leading to a higher risk of aluminium accumulation in the kidneys of individuals with CKD, compared to lanthanum which is very poorly absorbed and not excreted by the kidneys. The Committee noted that children with hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism are contradicted to aluminium due to the toxicity risks and the impact on the brain and skeleton.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that in 2021, there were approximately 3155 New Zealanders on dialysis, 75-90% of which would be using phosphate binders. Hence, the Committee considered that approximately 2500-2850 individuals on dialysis would be receiving medical treatment for hyperphosphataemia annually. The Committee considered that if those with CKD not yet on dialysis are taken into consideration, this number could be potentially two to three times higher. The Committee note that there is no data relating to how well current treatments for hyperphosphataemia are working, or how many individuals with hyperphosphataemia who are taking currently funded treatments still do not have adequately controlled phosphate levels.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the applications being assessed were targeted to individuals who require treatment for hyperphosphataemia who are on dialysis but considered that this should be expanded to include all individuals with CKD requiring treatment for hyperphosphataemia. The Committee considered that the benefits/harms of phosphate binders are likely to be the same between these two groups. </span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Health Benefit</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that lanthanum carbonate is a non-aluminium, non-calcium-based phosphate binder, which forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed, reducing phosphate absorption. The Committee noted that sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchanged resin which lowers the phosphate concentration in serum by binding phosphorous in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption and does not contain calcium.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the NICE 2021 guideline for the assessment and management for chronic kidney disease (</span><a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">NG203</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">) which compared all phosphate binders, which included a network metanalysis. The Committee noted that this guideline discussed and interpreted the evidence and made recommendations for a combined population of individuals with stage 5 CKD on dialysis and stage 4 or 5 CKD not on dialysis. The Committee noted that this guidance document commented on the lack of credible mortality data available. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis presented in NG203 compared eleven different treatments, including those currently funded in New Zealand, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate. The Committee noted that there was not a clinically significant difference between any of the agents in reducing phosphate levels, and that treatments varied in their efficacy at different time points. The Committee considered the quality of evidence included in the network meta-analysis to be of low quality. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that calcium carbonate treatment increases calcium in the blood, but considered that this is not necessarily harmful to individuals receiving treatment unless calcium levels are already high (i.e. hypercalcaemia). The Committee noted that in this instance, calcium containing binders would likely not be used. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee note the LANDMARK trial (</span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003226/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Ogata et al. JAMA. 2021; 18:1946-1954</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">)\u00a0where individuals with CKD, hyperphosphatasaemia and at least one factor of vascular calcification were randomised to receive either lanthanum carbonate (n = 1154) or calcium carbonate (n = 1155) and titrated to achieve serum phosphate levels of between 3.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia). Following 3.16 years cardiovascular events occurred in 147 of 1063 patients in the lanthanum calcium group and 134 of 1072 patients in the calcium carbonate group (incidence rate, 4.80 vs 4.30 per 100 person-years; difference 0.50 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.57 to 1.56]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95%, CI, 0.88 to 1.41], P = 0.37). There were no significant differences in all-cause death (difference, 0.43 per 100 person-years [95% CI, -0.63 to 1.49]; HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.37]; P = 0.42). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the available evidence does not suggest lanthanum is likely to significantly reduce mortality or the number of cardiovascular events. The Committee considered that mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, and vascular calcification outcomes are clinically important to consider for individuals with CKD but considered that there is no strong evidence to inform how and to what degree this is impacted by lowering phosphate. However, the Committee considered that lowering phosphate was clinically desirable and that lanthanum would be a useful additional option for clinicians.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that the context of the applications for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate was to include these agents as alternatives to current treatments and not necessarily as a replacement. The Committee considered that for the majority, lanthanum would be combined with calcium-phosphate binders. The Committee noted that there is no data relating to the benefit of the addition of these agents into regiments with currently funded phosphate lowering binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted the </span><a href=\"https://aktn.org.au/phosphate-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">PHOSPHATE</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> study, currently being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand, and noted that hard outcomes relating to any benefits for lowering phosphate in individuals with CKD may be clearer following publication of results from this study.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Suitability</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would not replace current treatment for many individuals with hyperphosphataemia but would rather be in addition to their current treatment. The Committee considered that funding these treatments would add to already significant \u201cpill burden\u201d experienced by these individuals. However, the Committee considered that the impact of this is unclear and that if all medications were to be taken at the same time of day (ie three times daily with meals) adherence may not be impacted.\u00a0</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Cost and savings</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that use of aluminium hydroxide in New Zealand would almost exclusively be for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, and not use as antacid treatment. The Committee considered that individuals from this group are likely to access sevelamer or lanthanum as both medications can be utilised as an add-on to calcium or aluminium based binders or replacement therapy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that the number of individuals with chronic renal failure potentially requiring treatment with lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate would be two to three times the number of individuals receiving dialysis. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee considered that there would be a subset of patients currently receiving aluminium hydroxide who would switch over to lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer carbonate due to the potential toxicities associated with aluminium but considered that this number would be small.</span></p><h3><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1.21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The </span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: black;\">Advisory Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate if it were to be funded in New Zealand for hyperphosphataemia in adults with CKD. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.
