The Subcommittee also noted that Pacific people have previously been reported to have a higher age-standardised rate of thyroid cancer compared with European/other New Zealanders; standardised rate ratio 1.27 for Pacific males compared with European/other males (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-2.18) and 3.58 (2.87-4.47) for Pacific females compared with European/other females (<a href=\"https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/otago036828.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Meredith et al.

The Subcommittee noted that 10-15% of trial participants had poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and that this patient group was not included as part of this application. The Subcommittee noted that the median progression-free survival was 18.3 months in the lenvatinib group compared with 3.6 months in placebo; hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14-0.31; P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that the response rate was 64.8% in the lenvatinib group compared with 1.5% in the placebo group, odds ratio 28.9 (95% CI: 12.5-66.9; P&lt;0.001). </p><p>1.4.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that 95.6% of patients originally assigned to placebo crossed over to lenvatinib in the subsequent optional open-label extension phase of the trial. The Subcommittee noted that the crude overall survival was not statistically significant, and considered that this was likely due to the large amount of cross over; however, when adjusted to correct for potential cross-over effects (resampling with a bootstrapping method), the reported crossover-corrected hazard ratio was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40- to 1.00, P=0.051; <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1406470/suppl_file/nejmoa1406470_appendix.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix to Schlumberger et al. 2015</b></a>). </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that NICE guidance published in <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta535/resources/lenvatinib-and-sorafenib-for-treating-differentiated-thyroid-cancer-after-radioactive-iodine-pdf-82606902620101\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>August 2018</b></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> regarding lenvatinib (and sorafenib) for treating differentiated thyroid cancer after radioactive iodine had reported that</span><span style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 250, 251); color: black;\"> \u201cin SELECT, median overall survival for lenvatinib was 41.6\u00a0months compared with 34.5\u00a0</span><span style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 250, 251); color: rgb(14, 14, 14);\">months for placebo. After correcting for crossover, there was a statistically significant overall survival benefit for lenvatinib compared with placebo (RPSFT-adjusted HR 0.54, 95% bootstrapping CI 0.36 to 0.80)\u201d, where RPSFT referred to the rank preserving structural failure time method. The Subcommittee noted that the supplier application had stated this was based on analysis of an August 2015 data cut-off </span>with median OS of 41.6 months for lenvatinib versus 19.1 months for placebo. The Subcommittee considered the statistical methodology to be appropriate and that the statistically adjusted crossover-corrected results appeared credible.\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the RECIST v1.1 response rate according to RECIST v1.1 in the lenvatinib group, from an updated analysis with data cut-off in September 2016, was 64.8% compared with 1.5% in the placebo group (odds ratio 28.87, 95% CI: 12.46-66.86, P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee also noted that the median duration of response for all lenvatinib responders was 30 months, indicating lenvatinib responders having prolonged, durable and clinically meaningful responses (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5958278/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Gianoukakis et al.

The Subcommittee considered that the WHO performance status should be amended to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, noting that while the two measurements are very similar in practice, New Zealand clinicians are more familiar ECOG, and that this would also maintain consistency with other oncology Special Authority criteria. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that under the proposed Special Authority criteria, approximately 5-6% of all thyroid cancer patients (equal to approximately 20 patients per year) would be eligible for lenvatinib treatment if it were funded, and noted that many of these patients would have likely received one or more courses of radioactive iodine. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that patients with radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer currently receive best supportive care and considered that this is appropriate comparator for lenvatinib in this indication. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that hypertension was a common adverse event associated with lenvatinib in the SELECT trial, and therefore considered that anti-hypertensives would likely be used concurrently in many patients.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.12.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if lenvatinib were funded, there may be an increased need for imaging resources which would align with imaging requirements in the SELECT trial, however as an oral medication it was unlikely to have any other substantial impacts to health system resources. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.13.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered likely uptake in the first year could be 60%, rising in later years to 90-95%, reflective of the crossover uptake seen in the SELECT trial. The Subcommittee considered that the duration of response of 30 months demonstrated in the SELECT trial would indicate that patients may remain on treatment into a third year.</p>",
