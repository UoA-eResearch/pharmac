The Committee considered that the main treatment benefits of somatropin after one year of treatment were an increase in height standard deviation score [mean difference (MD) 0.91; 95% CI 0.58–1.23] and increase in height velocity (MD 3.88 cm/y, 95% CI 3.32 to 4.44). The Committee noted that height velocity remained significantly greater in treated children than untreated children during the second year of therapy and considered that the estimated increase in adult height after two to five years of treatment could be about 7.4cm in boys and 7.0cm in girls. The Committee noted that a dose of 14 IU/m<sup>2</sup> per week (equivalent to 0.023 mg/kg per day) was associated with a higher increase in height velocity at one year compared with 28 IU/m<sup>2</sup> per week.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the available evidence supported a treatment benefit in terms of accelerated growth rate spanning at least two years of treatment and had been observed in pre-pubertal children with various manifestations of renal insufficiency.

The Committee also noted that most international guidelines set the eGFR threshold for growth hormone eligibility at &lt;60ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and that it was appropriate for the New Zealand Special Authority to be amended to align with these guidelines. The Committee considered that this widening access to children/adolescents with &lt;60ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> would not result in a substantial increase in patient numbers compared to the numbers currently observed at the 30ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> threshold, as most children with impaired growth due to renal insufficiency would be among the currently funded patient group who have more advanced renal disease. The Committee considered that younger children with renal impairment would be considered for transplant rather than somatropin treatment.</p><p>1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that dosing of somatropin among children was usually calculated on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis compared to adult dosages, which were based on mg/kg. The Committee noted that the usual starting dose for somatropin in children with chronic renal insufficiency was 1mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, and that the dose could be increased to 1.4mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day for effect. The Committee considered that the dosages reported in most trials and observational studies for somatropin in this indication were roughly equivalent to those used in New Zealand clinical practice.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that most children with chronic renal insufficiency were older children, and it was reasonable to assume an average age at treatment initiation of 8 years, and a body surface area of 1m<sup>2</sup>. The Committee considered that renal function of between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> would remain relatively stable once treatment commences, although the length of time on treatment would vary depending on the underlying disease. The Committee therefore considered that the eligible patient group would increase over time. The Committee considered a very minor increase in resource usage may occur with annual bone age monitoring (usually to check predicted height) and IGF-1 testing twice per year (to check adherence and dosing), although noted that this population of children would routinely undergo blood testing every three or six months.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for somatropin if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of short stature due to chronic renal insufficiency.

3,"<p>Pharmac staff uses a prioritisation process to compare and rank funding options. Possible opportunities for new investment will always exceed the budget Pharmac has available; therefore, prioritisation is an intrinsic part of Pharmac’s decision-making process.</p>

<p>A funding application or proposal is considered ready for prioritisation when sufficient information is available to permit it to be reviewed against Pharmac's Factors for Consideration and to inform a comparison with other possible investment decisions.</p>
