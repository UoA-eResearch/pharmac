The study reported the highest odds ratio was observed in the comparison group of trastuzumab emtansine (3.6 mg/kg) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) for the mean incidence of serious adverse event (2.04; 95% CrI, 1.79\u20132.31). The odds ratio in the same comparison group of the mean incidences of high-grade adverse event and drug discontinuation due to adverse event were 1.78 (95% CrI, 1.65\u20131.90) and 1.56 (95% CrI, 1.25\u20131.91), respectively. In addition, the overall mean incidences of adverse events of trastuzumab deruxtecan was also higher than trastuzumab emtansine, the odds ratio of high-grade adverse event and serious adverse event were 1.49 (95% CrI, 1.42\u20131.58) and 1.45 (95% CrI, 1.32\u20131.58), respectively.

The Committee considered that it was likely that people treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan would stay on treatment significantly longer when compared with trastuzumab emtansine. </p><p>35.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that an increase in monitoring due to ILD risk would be required including regular computerised tomography (CT) monitoring. The Committee noted any increased length of treatment would be associated with an increased requirement for individuals to travel for treatment and monitoring. </p><h3><em>Cost and savings</em></h3><p>36.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that additional screening for ILD would be necessary. The Committee noted that ILD was monitored in the key trial through CT monitoring and pulmonary function tests, although considered that pulmonary function tests do not occur routinely in practice. The Committee considered that while CT scans occurred every 6 weeks in the trial population to check for ILD, this may occur approximately every 3 months in New Zealand clinical practice for those with metastatic breast cancer. </p><p>37.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if ILD was not detected early, and prior to symptoms, it could lead to rapid deterioration and potentially death. The Committee noted that ILD was treated with corticosteroids. </p><p>38.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that it was possible that there may be a greater need for central line access with the funding of trastuzumab deruxtecan, given the duration of treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. However, the Committee considered that the vast majority of those eligible for trastuzumab deruxtecan would already have central line access, given the infusion requirements for currently funded treatments.</p><p>39.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if funded, given the improvement in efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan compared to trastuzumab emtansine, most people with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer would be treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (approximately 90%). However, the Committee considered that individuals who were more physically frail may instead be treated with trastuzumab emtansine due to the increased toxicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan. The Committee considered that this was unlikely to change over time.</p><h3><em>Funding criteria</em></h3><p>40.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there was insufficient evidence to support subsequent treatment of this population group with trastuzumab emtansine following treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. <span style=\"color: black;\">However, those who received trastuzumab emtansine in the early breast cancer setting, or are receiving trastuzumab emtansine in the metastatic setting at the time a positive funding decision is made, should be eligible to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan in the metastatic setting upon progression. </span></p><p>41.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that additional amendments to the Special Authority criteria for both trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan would be needed to reflect this, should a positive funding decision be made. </p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p>42.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for trastuzumab deruxtecan if it were to be funded in New Zealand for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer. This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff.

Compared with other ethnicities, Pacific women have the lowest proportion of breast cancer diagnoses made through the screening process, the lowest proportion of disease diagnosed at stage 1, and the highest proportion of disease diagnosed at Stage 3 and 4. In addition, Pacific women were more likely to decline treatment for breast cancer than any other ethnicity, had longer delays to surgery than other ethnic groups and the highest rate of mastectomy. Furthermore, following mastectomy, Pacific women were less likely to receive radiation therapy than those of European ethnicity.</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.breastcancerregister.org.nz/latest-research/register-report-2003-2020\" target=\"_blank\">Breast Cancer Foundation National Register 2003-2020</a> \u00a0reported that the requirement to travel, access to transport, taking time off work for both the person undergoing treatment and the caregiver, and other costs are likely barriers preventing equitable access to care.</p><h3><em>Health benefit </em></h3><p>18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that trastuzumab deruxtecan is a humanised HER-2-targeted antibody and topoisomerase I inhibitor conjugate.

QLQ-C30 baseline GHS scores recorded for trastuzumab deruxtecan (n = 253) and trastuzumab emtansine (n = 260) were similar. Median time to definitive deterioration (TDD) of QLQ-C30 GHS was 9.7 months for trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 8.3 months for trastuzumab emtansine (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.70-1.11]), Median TDD of EQ-5D-5L VAS was 13.2 months for trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 8.5 months for trastuzumab emtansine (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.98]).

The Committee noted that ILD was monitored in the key trial through CT monitoring and pulmonary function tests, although considered that pulmonary function tests do not occur routinely in practice. The Committee considered that while CT scans occurred every 6 weeks in the trial population to check for ILD, this may occur approximately every 3 months in New Zealand clinical practice for those with metastatic breast cancer. </p><p>37.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that if ILD was not detected early, and prior to symptoms, it could lead to rapid deterioration and potentially death.
