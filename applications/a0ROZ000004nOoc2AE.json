The Committee noted that ACS is a significant cause of mortality, with significant inequity experienced by M\u0101ori and Pacific people who experience ACS at a younger age. The Committee noted that ACS is encompassed in the M\u0101ori health area of focus, Hauora Arotahi - Manawa Ora (Heart Health \u2013 high blood pressure and stroke), with Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) responsible for 40% of deaths in M\u0101ori under the age of 65 versus 10% for non-M\u0101ori. It is estimated that the one year post-ACS presentation, the mortality rate for M\u0101ori is 2.55 times that of non-M\u0101ori / non-Pacific populations (<a href=\"https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/inequity-in-one-year-mortality-after-first-myocardial-infarction-in-maori-and-pacific-patients-how-much-is-associated-with-differences-in-modifiable-clinical-risk-factors-anzacs-qi-49\" target=\"_blank\">Mazengarb et al.

The Committee noted that the ISAR-REACT 5 trial was designed to show a benefit of ticagrelor over prasugrel in the treatment of patients post-ACS. The trial reported an advantage to prasugrel with regards to the composite endpoint of death any cause / myocardial infarction or stroke at one year with a hazard ratio for ticagrelor of 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.70 P&lt;0.006). It was also noted that the hazard ratio for death any cause for ticagrelor was 1.23 (95% CI 0.91-1.69) versus prasugrel, and the hazard ratio for ticagrelor for myocardial infarction was 1.63 (95% CI 1.18-2.25).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the findings of the HOST_REDUCE_POLYTECH_ACS open label non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620317918\" target=\"_blank\">Kim et al.

The Committee noted that the ISAR-REACT 5 trial was designed to show a benefit of ticagrelor over prasugrel in the treatment of patients post-ACS. The trial reported an advantage to prasugrel with regards to the composite endpoint of death any cause / myocardial infarction or stroke at one year with a hazard ratio for ticagrelor of 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.70 P&lt;0.006). It was also noted that the hazard ratio for death any cause for ticagrelor was 1.23 (95% CI 0.91-1.69) versus prasugrel, and the hazard ratio for ticagrelor for myocardial infarction was 1.63 (95% CI 1.18-2.25).</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.6.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the findings of the HOST_REDUCE_POLYTECH_ACS open label non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620317918\" target=\"_blank\">Kim et al. Lancet 2020; 396:1079-89</a>), which randomised 2338 patients presenting with ACS to treatment with prasugrel using either a standard dose (n=1168) of 10 mg prasugrel + 100 mg aspirin for one year versus a de-escalation dose (n=1170) of 10 mg prasugrel + 100 mg aspirin for one month then 5 mg prasugrel + 100 mg aspirin for 11 months. The trial reported on Net Adverse Clinical Events defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal MI, stent thrombosis and bleeding events BARC grade 2 or higher. The Committee noted that the trial reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 (CI 0.52-0.92) in favour of the de-escalation treatment arm. The Committee noted that the advantage of the de-escalation dosing strategy was particularly noticeable with the secondary safety end point of bleeding BARC type 2 or greater, where a HR of 0.48 (CI 0.32-0.73) was observed.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the trial evidence demonstrated that prasugrel was at least as effective as ticagrelor in the treatment of patient post-ACS, with the advantage of having once daily dosing, which the Committee considered may result in improved treatment adherence over the required 12-month post-ACS treatment period.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.8.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the evidence tabled in the HOST_REDUCE POLYTECH_ACS trial was impressive, demonstrating non-inferior primary efficacy with a significant reduction in on-treatment bleeding. However, the Committee noted that this was an open-label trial and that it was conducted on an East Asian population (Korean), and its results may or may not be realised in a New Zealand population to the same degree. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that both trials used objective endpoints of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. It was observed by some Members of the Committee that the period of the trials was only 12 months; however it was noted that there was no strong evidence available to support continued post-ACS dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) past 12 months.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.10.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that most prescribers would likely favour the use of prasugrel over ticagrelor should it be made available on the Pharmaceutical Schedule.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.11.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for prasugrel if it were to be funded in New Zealand for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ST elevation myocardial infarct or non-ST elevation myocardial infarct (STEMI or non-STEMI). This PICO captures key clinical aspects of the proposal and may be used to frame any future economic assessment by Pharmac staff. This PICO is based on the Advisory Committee\u2019s assessment at this time and may differ from that requested by the applicant. The PICO may change based on new information, additional clinical advice, or further analysis by Pharmac staff.</p><p><img src=\"/apptracker/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0POZ00000CNY3p&amp;feoid=00N2P000000YsIc&amp;refid=0EM2P000002ZNIl\" alt=\"image.png\"></img></p>",
