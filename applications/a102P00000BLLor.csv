The Committee noted that there is limited information regarding appropriate dosing of venetoclax for those with severe renal impairment (creatine clearance less than 30 mL/min).

The Committee noted that there are some logistical difficulties for managing rural patients during this venetoclax dose titration stage, due to limited access to timely blood tests. The Committee considered that about 50% of patients would require the low-risk blood testing protocol during venetoclax dose titration. The Committee considered that a BTK inhibitor without the TLS risk associated with venetoclax and not requiring TLS prophylaxis would be more convenient, as patients would be able to start treatment at home, without the need for blood testing or hospital admission.\xa0\xa0</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that for both treatment naïve patients and patients with relapsed disease, venetoclax would be intolerable for approximately 20% of patients, and that a further 20% of patients would experience an inadequate response to venetoclax containing regimens upfront (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27178240/"" target=""_blank"">Stilgenbauer et al.

The Committee considered that any evidence relating to acalabrutinib efficacy post treatment with venetoclax is unlikely to be forthcoming as BTK inhibitors are already used widely internationally, usually before treatment with venetoclax. The Committee considered that although it is not aware of any direct evidence relating to the efficacy of acalabrutinib following treatment with a venetoclax containing regimen, given the class effect of these BTK inhibitors, it would be reasonable to assume similar efficacy in later lines of therapy between ibrutinib and acalabrutinib.</p><p><em>Remaining unmet need</em></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there remains an unmet need for those patients whose disease progresses after 36 months of previous treatment. The Committee noted that fit patients with good performance status without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation who are treated with FCR and relapse after three years or more following treatment have limited treatment options. The Committee noted that FCR is not usually considered for patients who have reduced performance status (eg. older than 70-75 years), meaning that few patients would be fit enough to be re-treated with FCR at relapse. Fit patients who relapse after treatment with bendamustine in combination with rituximab or after treatment with obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil also have limited further options. The Committee considered that retreatment with venetoclax/rituximab may be an option for those patients whose disease progresses after greater than 36 months of prior venetoclax treatment. The Committee considered that restricting access to acalabrutinib to only those patients whose disease had relapsed within 36 months would mean that those whose disease responded better to treatment with venetoclax with rituximab would be without effective treatment options in later lines of therapy.</p><p><em>Other considerations</em></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that whilst the patient populations considered for acalabrutinib have unmet health needs, there is a broader need for a BTK inhibitor or expanded access to venetoclax treatment for CLL patients.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that whilst the oral administration of BTK inhibitors is a more practical option especially for those living rurally, treatment with acalabrutinib or ibrutinib is until progression, as opposed to a fixed duration of treatment with some venetoclax containing regimens. Therefore, the Committee considered that ongoing treatment with a BTK inhibitor would require continued adherence, frequent prescription pick-ups, and increased outpatient clinic visits compared with fixed duration therapy. The Committee also noted that acalabrutinb dosing is twice daily whilst ibrutinib dosing is once daily. The Committee considered it important to consider the ease of oral therapy as well as the duration of treatment. The Committee noted that there is also an increased risk of development of secondary malignancies for patients treated with BTK inhibitors, including non-melanoma skin cancers (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704159/"" target=""_blank"">Bond et al.

For patients with relapsed/refractory disease, the Committee noted that fixed duration of venetoclax containing regimens (2 years) would be replaced by continuous acalabrutinib treatment until progression which could mean BTK inhibitor treatment for longer than 5 years.

The Committee considered that although it is not aware of any direct evidence relating to the efficacy of acalabrutinib following treatment with a venetoclax containing regimen, given the class effect of these BTK inhibitors, it would be reasonable to assume similar efficacy in later lines of therapy between ibrutinib and acalabrutinib.</p><p><em>Remaining unmet need</em></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.20.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that there remains an unmet need for those patients whose disease progresses after 36 months of previous treatment.

The Committee noted that FCR is not usually considered for patients who have reduced performance status (eg. older than 70-75 years), meaning that few patients would be fit enough to be re-treated with FCR at relapse. Fit patients who relapse after treatment with bendamustine in combination with rituximab or after treatment with obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil also have limited further options. The Committee considered that retreatment with venetoclax/rituximab may be an option for those patients whose disease progresses after greater than 36 months of prior venetoclax treatment. The Committee considered that restricting access to acalabrutinib to only those patients whose disease had relapsed within 36 months would mean that those whose disease responded better to treatment with venetoclax with rituximab would be without effective treatment options in later lines of therapy.</p><p><em>Other considerations</em></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that whilst the patient populations considered for acalabrutinib have unmet health needs, there is a broader need for a BTK inhibitor or expanded access to venetoclax treatment for CLL patients.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">1.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that whilst the oral administration of BTK inhibitors is a more practical option especially for those living rurally, treatment with acalabrutinib or ibrutinib is until progression, as opposed to a fixed duration of treatment with some venetoclax containing regimens.

The Committee also noted that acalabrutinb dosing is twice daily whilst ibrutinib dosing is once daily.
