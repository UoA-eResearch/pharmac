The Subcommittee noted that patients with intermediate risk disease (ie no history of thrombosis, JAK2 un-mutated, over 60 years of age) are usually treated with hydroxyurea in combination with aspirin.

In particular, the Subcommittee considered that the risk of development of acute myeloid leukaemia from prolonged exposure to hydroxyurea was unknown and the evidence supporting the tumorgenicity of hydroxyurea in the setting of leukaemia was limited. The Subcommittee noted that interferons can reduce tumour mutational burden and considered that this could be considered beneficial for younger patients as they would likely be exposed to treatment for many years.

The Subcommittee noted that the use of busulfan was favoured in elderly, or frail, patients as it is well tolerated and very effective.

The Subcommittee noted that preliminary results showed similar overall response rate for hydroxyurea and peginterferon alfa-2a after 12 months of treatment (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/132/Supplement%201/577/263247/Results-of-the-Myeloproliferative-Neoplasms"" target=""_blank"">Mascarenhas J et al.

However, the Subcommittee noted that at 24 months, among 106 patients eligible to receive treatment at 24 months, peginterferon alfa-2a response rates were similar to hydroxyurea but peginterferon alfa-2a was associated with higher rates of grade 3/4 toxicity, with no clear advantage in quality of life (<a href=""https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/132/Supplement%201/3032/263702/Impact-on-MPN-Symptoms-and-Quality-of-Life-of"" target=""_blank"">Mesa R et al.

Leukemia. 2021. 35, 1643–1660</a>.). The Subcommittee considered that peginterferon alfa-2a had similar efficacy with respect to both molecular response and haematological response. The Subcommittee considered that there may be a rationale for superiority upon longer exposure and considered that it would be useful to obtain longer-term data for the use of peginterferon alfa-2a in this setting to inform on its long-term efficacy and safety.</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that peginterferon alfa-2a would likely initially result in an increase in adverse events, and that the pattern of these would differ compared to hydroxyurea. The Subcommittee considered that peginterferon alfa-2a is widely considered an acceptable alternative to hydroxyurea in patients with the following: low-risk disease requiring frequent phlebotomy, pruritis, symptomatic splenomegaly, persistent microvascular symptoms, intolerance to hydroxyurea, and in young women of reproductive age.</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the treatment of polycythaemia vera (PV) in New Zealand was largely aligned to that described in a recent review (Tefferi A et al. Leukemia. 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-021-01401-3). The Subcommittee noted that in patients less than 60 years of age there would be very few that would require additional treatment beyond phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. However, the Subcommittee noted that for those that do require additional treatment, peginterferon alfa-2a could be used. The Subcommittee considered that it is important for women of reproductive age to receive peginterferon alfa-2a as opposed to hydroxyurea. The Subcommittee noted that this group of patients could already access peginterferon alfa-2a via the current Special Authority criteria. The Subcommittee considered that the additional patient populations for whom peginterferon alfa-2a provides a benefit in the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders can also already access it via the Special Authority criteria, which were widened when interferon-alfa was discontinued in June 2020.</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there is increasing concern regarding the longer-term safety (eg. tumorigenicity) of hydroxyurea in young patients who are likely to be exposed to this treatment for a long period of time, however considered that the risk of this remained uncertain and that the evidence supporting this was largely circumstantial. In particular, the Subcommittee considered that the risk of development of acute myeloid leukaemia from prolonged exposure to hydroxyurea was unknown and the evidence supporting the tumorgenicity of hydroxyurea in the setting of leukaemia was limited. The Subcommittee noted that interferons can reduce tumour mutational burden and considered that this could be considered beneficial for younger patients as they would likely be exposed to treatment for many years. However, the Subcommittee considered that predisposition for tumorigenicity was more likely to be related to other background factors associated with the disease such as clonal instability, mutational landscape and risk status of the myeloproliferative disorder.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee noted that there would be a small proportion of younger patients that would present with myeloproliferative disorders and therefore, there would be a small group of patients that would be treated with peginterferon alfa-2a if funded for this group. The Subcommittee noted that there would be a greater cost to the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget if peginterferon alfa-2a were funded for the universal first-line treatment of myeloproliferative disorders. However, the Subcommittee considered that most haematologists would likely use hydroxyurea even if peginterferon alfa-2a were made available, according to the guidelines regarding the treatment of PV.</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the incidence of adverse events that would be experienced with peginterferon alfa-2a would be greater than that of both hydroxyurea and anagrelide. The Subcommittee noted that very few patients receive anagrelide in New Zealand and considered that this was primarily due to cardiac adverse events, which is of particular concern for this patient group. The Subcommittee noted that the use of busulfan was favoured in elderly, or frail, patients as it is well tolerated and very effective. The Subcommittee further noted that peginterferon alfa-2a has been previously associated with mood alterations (eg. depression, a common adverse event for patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a) in patients receiving this agent for treatment of hepatitis C.</p><p><br></p><p>1.1.13.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Subcommittee considered that if funded, the use of peginterferon alfa-2a would be similar to other refrigerated products that are administered subcutaneously.

However, the Subcommittee considered that there was no new evidence presented that would alter or impact its previous recommendation at this time. The Subcommittee considered that the current levels of evidence supporting longer term outcomes in relation to tumorigenicity of hydroxyurea compared to peginterferon alfa-2a remain insufficient, that there is no survival benefit for peginterferon alfa-2a compared to hydroxyurea, and that decreasing mutational burden does not change a patients risk profile. The Subcommittee therefore did not change its previous recommendation to decline this funding application for widened access to peginterferon alfa-2a for the first-line treatment of myeloproliferative disorders.</p>', 'Status_History__c': 'a132P000000DbnLQAS'}, 'change': None}]",Nov 2020,False,True
