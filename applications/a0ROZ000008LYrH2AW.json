The Committee was informed of data from Te Whatu Ora that reported up to 10% of cases of malignant neoplasms of the brain in 2020 were M\u0101ori. The Committee noted despite similar incidence rates, there have been reports of M\u0101ori waiting 1.32 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.79) times longer to receive radiotherapy, and having poorer median survival times compared to non-M\u0101ori (hazard ratio 1.55 [95% CI 0.95\u20132.55]) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586810001888?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander et al. J. Clin. Neurosci. 2010;17;1144-7</a>).</p><h3><em>Background</em></h3><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that PTAC had previously recommended that bevacizumab as a monotherapy for individuals with relapsed or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) be declined, following their consideration of the clinical benefit and risk, the cost effectiveness, and the budgetary impact (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2016-02-update-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PTAC February 2016</a>). PTAC had considered that the evidence was of poor strength and quality, as the studies did not compare bevacizumab&#39;s use with a control arm, and due to the relatively small number of individuals involved. The Committee noted that PTAC had also deferred making any recommendation for bevacizumab as a combination therapy with lomustine for individuals with relapsed or recurrent gliomas, pending publication of data from the EORTC phase III trial.</p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that lomustine, a treatment used to treat the same population, is being discontinued by the supplier, and that as Pharmac has not been able to secure an alternative brand.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that gliomas refer to all forms of intra-axial tumours that originate from glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the CNS classifies gliomas into grades (I-IV) based on pathological evaluation using molecular information on the malignancy level.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the most common form of high-grade glioma is a grade IV subtype GBM, with grade III glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), a rarer form. The Committee noted that GBM refers to an astrocytoma with WHO grade 4 classification, and an AA is the same tumour type, but with a grade 3 classification. The Committee noted that the determination of grade is related to adverse histologic prognostic factors identified following biopsy.</p><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of glioma depends on the tumour location and size at diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms and signs at diagnosis are headaches and/or nausea and seizures in the context of a large tumour or significant cerebral oedema. The Committee noted that differentiation of tumour type between grade III or IV usually occurs at surgery, as the clinical symptoms and radiological signs associated with the two tumour types are relatively similar and nonspecific in nature, and noted that both have a poor response to medical management and a poor prognosis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552189/\" target=\"_blank\">Tian et al, Front Oncol. 2019;9:876</a>).</p><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the 5-year overall relative survival rate for those with GBM is 6.8%, which varies by age at diagnosis and sex, with median overall survival (OS) approximately 10-12 months in a New Zealand population-based studies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8789307/\" target=\"_blank\">McManus, Neurooncol Pract. 2022;9:43-9</a>). The Committee noted that a study that used evidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database reported the overall 5-year survival of AA is reported to be 22%, with the highest 5-year survival rate of 49.9% seen in those in the 15- to 24-year-old age group, and the lowest of 2.5% seen in the 75- to 84-year-old age group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\">Smoll et al, Neuro Oncol. 2014;16:1400-7</a>).</p><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the annual incidence of gliomas is approximately six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Men are 1.6-fold more likely to be diagnosed with gliomas than women, with approximately 5% of gliomas having a familial origin (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293629/\" target=\"_blank\">Weller et al. Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2021;18:170-86</a>). The Committee noted the incidence of malignant gliomas is bimodal with the highest incidence observed in the young and the elderly, the age distribution varying by histological type. GBM is known to have the highest incidence in people aged in their late 60s and early 70s, with frequency then reducing in older age groups. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827837/\" target=\"_blank\">Ostrom et al, Neuro Oncol. 2019; 21:1357-75</a>). The incidence of AA has been reported to also increase with age (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\">Smoll et al. </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">2014</a><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(33, 33, 33);\">)</span>.The rates were 2.6 in young adults, 4.7 in adults, and 8.4 in elderly per million person-years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\">Smoll et al,</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Neuro Oncol.\u00a02014; 16:1400-7</a><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(33, 33, 33);\">).</span></p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee previously noted (<a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-catsop-subcommittee-minutes-2014-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CaTSoP March 2014</a>) that approximately 260 people were diagnosed with primary brain cancer each year in New Zealand, with peak incidence occurring between 45-75 years old. Members had noted that approximately 70% were diagnosed with GBM, and the rest AA.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted individuals with relapsed, recurrent gliomas including AA and GBM present with a variety of largely non-specific symptoms that vary based on the position of the tumour but which can also be accompanied by problems in motor function and speech and commonly epileptic seizures, which reduce quality of life (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. J Basic Med Sci. 2019;19:116-24</a>). In addition, treatment with radiotherapy can reduce the quality of life in some individuals from the associated adverse effects (AEs) such as hair loss, fatigue, somnolence, or cognitive problems, and some may also experience the progression of dementia.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at present there is no cure for relapsed, recurrent gliomas or GBM, with a life expectancy of 12 to 18 months after diagnosis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. 2019</a>).</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and prolonging progression free survival (PFS) and survival times. The Committee noted first-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy plus six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy (Stupp regimen). The Committee noted standards of care at recurrence are less well defined. A minority of individuals with recurrence may be offered a second surgery or irradiation treatment if possible. The majority of those affected then progress to systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or temozolomide (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318/\" target=\"_blank\">Schaff et al JAMA. 2023;329:574-87</a>). The Committee noted that temozolomide is funded for people with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas and that funding allows for beyond six cycles of maintenance temozolomide treatment.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a recent study of caregivers of people with a GBM diagnosis that found that performance status is a critical clinical factor that significantly affects caregiver burden, caregiving tasks, and caregiver time. Additionally, caring for individuals with GBM who are confused, affects multiple facets of caregiver burden and their quality of life. <em>(</em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34510238/\" target=\"_blank\">Au et al, Supportive Care in Cancer, 2022;30:1365-75</a>).</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a study that highlighted that, despite similar incidence rates, M\u0101ori waited 1.32 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.79) times longer to receive radiotherapy, and had poorer median survival times compared to non-M\u0101ori (hazard ratio 1.55 [95% CI 0.95\u20132.55]) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586810001888?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander et al. osci. 2010;17;1144-7</a>).</p><p>14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The noted that approximately 50% of individuals with newly diagnosed GBM are over the age of 65. Overall survival (OS) in this population remains low, with this group reported as surviving approximately 9 months compared to approximately 15 months for the those aged below 65 years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8774312/\" target=\"_blank\">Chahal et al. Curr Oncol. 2022;29:360-6</a>). The Committee noted that older individuals may be treated with less aggressive surgical care due to concerns regarding the greater relative frailty of this population.</p><h3><em>Health benefit</em></h3><p>15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Neutralising the biologic activity of VEGF reduces tumour angiogenesis, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.</p><p>16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1707358?articleTools=true\" target=\"_blank\">Wick et al, N Engl J Med 2017;377:1954-63</a> study that reported the results of the phase 3 EORTC trial. 437 people at first progression of glioblastoma, after standard chemotherapy, were randomised 2:1 to lomustine plus bevacizumab (combination group, 288 people) or lomustine alone (monotherapy group, 149 people). Health-related quality of life and neurocognitive function were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks. The primary end point of the trial was OS.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there was a total of 329 OS events (75.3%), the combination therapy did not provide a statistically significant survival advantage; the median OS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 10.1) in the combination group and 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 10.4) in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.21; P=0.65).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the locally assessed progression free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months longer in the combination group than in the monotherapy group: 4.2 months versus 1.5 months (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61; P&lt;0.001). Deterioration-free survival was also longer in the combination group than in the monotherapy group (12.4 weeks vs. 6.7 weeks; P&lt;0.001). Grade 3 to 5 AEs occurred in 63.6% of the people in the combination group and 38.1% of the people in the monotherapy group. The addition of bevacizumab to lomustine affected neither health related quality of life nor neurocognitive function.</p><p>17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1308345\" target=\"_blank\">Chinot et al N Engl J Med 2014; 370:709-22</a> phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 921 people with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, supratentorial glioblastoma. People were treated with bevacizumab or placebo, plus radiotherapy (2 Gy 5 days a week; maximum, 60 Gy) temozolomide. Median PFS was 10.6 months bevacizumab vs 6.2 months placebo (stratified hazard ratio for progression or death with bevacizumab, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.74; P&lt;0.001 with the use of the log-rank test) Median OS was 16.8 months bevacizumab vs 16.7 months placebo (stratified hazard ratio for death with bevacizumab, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; P=0.10). The study reported that for quality of life, deterioration-free survival significantly longer in bevacizumab than placebo group for all five prespecified scales ((global health status, social functioning, and communication deficit, (hazard ratio for deterioration in global health status with bevacizumab, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74; P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). Glucocorticoid (ie corticosteroid) use was discontinued (for \u22655 consecutive days) in 66.3% of the bevacizumab treated individual\u2019s vs 47.1% in placebo treated receiving corticosteroids at baseline. Among those who were not receiving glucocorticoids at baseline, the time to initiation of glucocorticoids was longer with bevacizumab than with placebo (12.3 months vs. 3.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.88; P=0.002).

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021;5:CD013579</a> indirect comparison network meta-analysis reviewing treatment options for progression or recurrence of glioblastoma. The study reported that evidence of treatment efficacy on second recurrence is sparse.</p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonials provided of people with the disease, those caring for someone with the disease and clinicians. Brain Tumour Support NZ stated that affected individuals cared about the quality of life, not just the extended survival time. In addition, they stated bevacizumab provided an increase in PFS that extended time living without the symptoms of their brain tumour. They also stated that the resultant improvement in quality of life brings immediate benefits to people in their daily life and relationships.</p><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonial of one carer of an individual with GBM who had taken bevacizumab for 7 months, the carer stating that there had been a reduction in the swelling around the tumours that enabled a reduction in corticosteroid use. Several carers provided statements on the use of bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan, with one stating it had improved balance and cognitive function in a person with GBM, whilst another carer testified that for another person it allowed progression from being wheelchair bound to walking 30 minutes around their neighbourhood.</p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonials of clinicians which also stated that they were convinced of its very meaningful benefit in PFS, and enabling lower corticosteroid use, to improve quality of life in a number of those affected.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that whilst there were positive testimonials from clinicians, the clinical trial data was of poor quality. The Committee considered co-endpoints of PFS and OS indicated an improvement in PFS, however there was no evidence to suggest an increase in survival. The Committee considered that PFS is difficult to measure in gliomas, as there are imaging difficulties measuring cerebral oedema in recurrence. The Committee considered however that while bevacizumab is not a life-extending treatment, it is a corticosteroid sparing agent that can be used to manage and reduce oedema, which can result in clinical improvement in signs and symptoms.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given its use and primary efficacy as a corticosteroid sparing agent, bevacizumab would not be a useful replacement for lomustine, which is being discontinued globally. The Committee considered that replacement therapies for lomustine would likely be other cytotoxic agents.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted bevacizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion, and this treatment must be administered in an infusion centre, thereby placing a potential burden on anyone who must travel from rural or remote areas to receive treatment, as well as on the capacity of infusion services.</p><h3><em>Cost and savings</em></h3><p>31.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there would be a reduction in the use of corticosteroids in those receiving bevacizumab. The Committee noted that anti-hypertensives are also prescribed with high dose corticosteroids, and these are likely to be reduced with bevacizumab administration.</p><p>32.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>\u00a0The Committee considered that modelling cerebral oedema, the clinically relevant outcome bevacizumab affects in this context, would be difficult as it had been an exploratory/secondary endpoint (hence underpowered). The Committee considered that the evidence for effects on cerebral oedema was of poor quality and from trials that were negative in their primary endpoints (OS and PFS). The Committee however considered that treatment with bevacizumab would reduce the likelihood of cerebral oedema, and this may result in the increases observed in PFS. However, members considered this unlikely to translate to a benefit in overall survival.\u00a0</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab could be used in combination with carmustine, temozolomide, irinotecan and carboplatin. The Committee considered that the PICO (referred to below) should reflect that the comparator for bevacizumab as monotherapy (in comparison to the addition of bevacizumab to an active agent) would be corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisone. The Committee considered that the rationale for this was based on the reduction in side effects bevacizumab may offer over high dose corticosteroids. The Committee however considered that relevant evidence would be difficult to find, but that the research literature on myeloma could inform these extrapolations.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bevacizumab may not result in any significant changes in health-sector expenditure (diagnostic testing, nursing costs or treatment of side effects) except for the additional need for the infusions associated with bevacizumab administration. The Committee estimated that if funded, approximately 50% of people would receive best supportive care, instead of bevacizumab monotherapy or combination therapy.</p><p>35.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that modelling of AE was unlikely to be relevant, as serious AEs are rare and responders have a short survival time to experience any complications with bevacizumab.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">36.</span><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for individuals with relapsed, recurrent high-grade gliomas who have had a prior first line systemic therapy.

The Committee was informed of data from Te Whatu Ora that reported up to 10% of cases of malignant neoplasms of the brain in 2020 were M\u0101ori. The Committee noted despite similar incidence rates, there have been reports of M\u0101ori waiting 1.32 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.79) times longer to receive radiotherapy, and having poorer median survival times compared to non-M\u0101ori (hazard ratio 1.55 [95% CI 0.95\u20132.55]) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586810001888?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander et al.

PTAC had considered that the evidence was of poor strength and quality, as the studies did not compare bevacizumab&#39;s use with a control arm, and due to the relatively small number of individuals involved. The Committee noted that PTAC had also deferred making any recommendation for bevacizumab as a combination therapy with lomustine for individuals with relapsed or recurrent gliomas, pending publication of data from the EORTC phase III trial.</p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that lomustine, a treatment used to treat the same population, is being discontinued by the supplier, and that as Pharmac has not been able to secure an alternative brand.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that gliomas refer to all forms of intra-axial tumours that originate from glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the CNS classifies gliomas into grades (I-IV) based on pathological evaluation using molecular information on the malignancy level.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the most common form of high-grade glioma is a grade IV subtype GBM, with grade III glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), a rarer form. The Committee noted that GBM refers to an astrocytoma with WHO grade 4 classification, and an AA is the same tumour type, but with a grade 3 classification. The Committee noted that the determination of grade is related to adverse histologic prognostic factors identified following biopsy.</p><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of glioma depends on the tumour location and size at diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms and signs at diagnosis are headaches and/or nausea and seizures in the context of a large tumour or significant cerebral oedema. The Committee noted that differentiation of tumour type between grade III or IV usually occurs at surgery, as the clinical symptoms and radiological signs associated with the two tumour types are relatively similar and nonspecific in nature, and noted that both have a poor response to medical management and a poor prognosis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552189/\" target=\"_blank\">Tian et al, Front Oncol. 2019;9:876</a>).</p><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the 5-year overall relative survival rate for those with GBM is 6.8%, which varies by age at diagnosis and sex, with median overall survival (OS) approximately 10-12 months in a New Zealand population-based studies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8789307/\" target=\"_blank\">McManus, Neurooncol Pract. 2022;9:43-9</a>). The Committee noted that a study that used evidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database reported the overall 5-year survival of AA is reported to be 22%, with the highest 5-year survival rate of 49.9% seen in those in the 15- to 24-year-old age group, and the lowest of 2.5% seen in the 75- to 84-year-old age group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\">Smoll et al, Neuro Oncol. 2014;16:1400-7</a>).</p><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the annual incidence of gliomas is approximately six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Men are 1.6-fold more likely to be diagnosed with gliomas than women, with approximately 5% of gliomas having a familial origin (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293629/\" target=\"_blank\">Weller et al. Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2021;18:170-86</a>). The Committee noted the incidence of malignant gliomas is bimodal with the highest incidence observed in the young and the elderly, the age distribution varying by histological type. GBM is known to have the highest incidence in people aged in their late 60s and early 70s, with frequency then reducing in older age groups.

Members had noted that approximately 70% were diagnosed with GBM, and the rest AA.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted individuals with relapsed, recurrent gliomas including AA and GBM present with a variety of largely non-specific symptoms that vary based on the position of the tumour but which can also be accompanied by problems in motor function and speech and commonly epileptic seizures, which reduce quality of life (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. J Basic Med Sci. 2019;19:116-24</a>). In addition, treatment with radiotherapy can reduce the quality of life in some individuals from the associated adverse effects (AEs) such as hair loss, fatigue, somnolence, or cognitive problems, and some may also experience the progression of dementia.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at present there is no cure for relapsed, recurrent gliomas or GBM, with a life expectancy of 12 to 18 months after diagnosis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. 2019</a>).</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and prolonging progression free survival (PFS) and survival times. The Committee noted first-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy plus six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy (Stupp regimen). The Committee noted standards of care at recurrence are less well defined. A minority of individuals with recurrence may be offered a second surgery or irradiation treatment if possible. The majority of those affected then progress to systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or temozolomide (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318/\" target=\"_blank\">Schaff et al JAMA. 2023;329:574-87</a>). The Committee noted that temozolomide is funded for people with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas and that funding allows for beyond six cycles of maintenance temozolomide treatment.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a recent study of caregivers of people with a GBM diagnosis that found that performance status is a critical clinical factor that significantly affects caregiver burden, caregiving tasks, and caregiver time. Additionally, caring for individuals with GBM who are confused, affects multiple facets of caregiver burden and their quality of life. <em>(</em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34510238/\" target=\"_blank\">Au et al, Supportive Care in Cancer, 2022;30:1365-75</a>).</p><p>13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a study that highlighted that, despite similar incidence rates, M\u0101ori waited 1.32 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.79) times longer to receive radiotherapy, and had poorer median survival times compared to non-M\u0101ori (hazard ratio 1.55 [95% CI 0.95\u20132.55]) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586810001888?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander et al. osci. 2010;17;1144-7</a>).</p><p>14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The noted that approximately 50% of individuals with newly diagnosed GBM are over the age of 65. Overall survival (OS) in this population remains low, with this group reported as surviving approximately 9 months compared to approximately 15 months for the those aged below 65 years (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8774312/\" target=\"_blank\">Chahal et al. Curr Oncol. 2022;29:360-6</a>). The Committee noted that older individuals may be treated with less aggressive surgical care due to concerns regarding the greater relative frailty of this population.</p><h3><em>Health benefit</em></h3><p>15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Neutralising the biologic activity of VEGF reduces tumour angiogenesis, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.</p><p>16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1707358?articleTools=true\" target=\"_blank\">Wick et al, N Engl J Med 2017;377:1954-63</a> study that reported the results of the phase 3 EORTC trial. 437 people at first progression of glioblastoma, after standard chemotherapy, were randomised 2:1 to lomustine plus bevacizumab (combination group, 288 people) or lomustine alone (monotherapy group, 149 people). Health-related quality of life and neurocognitive function were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks. The primary end point of the trial was OS.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted there was a total of 329 OS events (75.3%), the combination therapy did not provide a statistically significant survival advantage; the median OS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 10.1) in the combination group and 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 10.4) in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.21; P=0.65).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">16.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the locally assessed progression free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months longer in the combination group than in the monotherapy group: 4.2 months versus 1.5 months (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61; P&lt;0.001).

The study reported that evidence of treatment efficacy on second recurrence is sparse.</p><p>25.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonials provided of people with the disease, those caring for someone with the disease and clinicians. Brain Tumour Support NZ stated that affected individuals cared about the quality of life, not just the extended survival time. In addition, they stated bevacizumab provided an increase in PFS that extended time living without the symptoms of their brain tumour. They also stated that the resultant improvement in quality of life brings immediate benefits to people in their daily life and relationships.</p><p>26.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonial of one carer of an individual with GBM who had taken bevacizumab for 7 months, the carer stating that there had been a reduction in the swelling around the tumours that enabled a reduction in corticosteroid use. Several carers provided statements on the use of bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan, with one stating it had improved balance and cognitive function in a person with GBM, whilst another carer testified that for another person it allowed progression from being wheelchair bound to walking 30 minutes around their neighbourhood.</p><p>27.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the testimonials of clinicians which also stated that they were convinced of its very meaningful benefit in PFS, and enabling lower corticosteroid use, to improve quality of life in a number of those affected.</p><p>28.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that whilst there were positive testimonials from clinicians, the clinical trial data was of poor quality. The Committee considered co-endpoints of PFS and OS indicated an improvement in PFS, however there was no evidence to suggest an increase in survival. The Committee considered that PFS is difficult to measure in gliomas, as there are imaging difficulties measuring cerebral oedema in recurrence. The Committee considered however that while bevacizumab is not a life-extending treatment, it is a corticosteroid sparing agent that can be used to manage and reduce oedema, which can result in clinical improvement in signs and symptoms.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given its use and primary efficacy as a corticosteroid sparing agent, bevacizumab would not be a useful replacement for lomustine, which is being discontinued globally. The Committee considered that replacement therapies for lomustine would likely be other cytotoxic agents.</p><h3><em>Suitability</em></h3><p>30.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted bevacizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion, and this treatment must be administered in an infusion centre, thereby placing a potential burden on anyone who must travel from rural or remote areas to receive treatment, as well as on the capacity of infusion services.</p><h3><em>Cost and savings</em></h3><p>31.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there would be a reduction in the use of corticosteroids in those receiving bevacizumab. The Committee noted that anti-hypertensives are also prescribed with high dose corticosteroids, and these are likely to be reduced with bevacizumab administration.</p><p>32.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>\u00a0The Committee considered that modelling cerebral oedema, the clinically relevant outcome bevacizumab affects in this context, would be difficult as it had been an exploratory/secondary endpoint (hence underpowered). The Committee considered that the evidence for effects on cerebral oedema was of poor quality and from trials that were negative in their primary endpoints (OS and PFS). The Committee however considered that treatment with bevacizumab would reduce the likelihood of cerebral oedema, and this may result in the increases observed in PFS. However, members considered this unlikely to translate to a benefit in overall survival.\u00a0</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab could be used in combination with carmustine, temozolomide, irinotecan and carboplatin. The Committee considered that the PICO (referred to below) should reflect that the comparator for bevacizumab as monotherapy (in comparison to the addition of bevacizumab to an active agent) would be corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisone. The Committee considered that the rationale for this was based on the reduction in side effects bevacizumab may offer over high dose corticosteroids. The Committee however considered that relevant evidence would be difficult to find, but that the research literature on myeloma could inform these extrapolations.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bevacizumab may not result in any significant changes in health-sector expenditure (diagnostic testing, nursing costs or treatment of side effects) except for the additional need for the infusions associated with bevacizumab administration. The Committee estimated that if funded, approximately 50% of people would receive best supportive care, instead of bevacizumab monotherapy or combination therapy.</p><p>35.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that modelling of AE was unlikely to be relevant, as serious AEs are rare and responders have a short survival time to experience any complications with bevacizumab.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">36.</span><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for individuals with relapsed, recurrent high-grade gliomas who have had a prior first line systemic therapy.

As first-line treatment, the majority were treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. At recurrence of 146 people with GBM, 106 had recurrence. These individuals were treated with the following: 50% best supportive care only, 26% chemotherapy alone, 8.5% surgery alone, and 11% surgery and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy given included procarbazine, PCV regime, temozolomide, irinotecan, carboplatin, and carboplatin plus etoposide.

J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2019;63:665-73</a> New Zealand-based study conducted between 2006-2015, involving 405 people, of whom 363 had high-grade gliomas. As first-line treatment, the majority were treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. At recurrence of 146 people with GBM, 106 had recurrence. These individuals were treated with the following: 50% best supportive care only, 26% chemotherapy alone, 8.5% surgery alone, and 11% surgery and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy given included procarbazine, PCV regime, temozolomide, irinotecan, carboplatin, and carboplatin plus etoposide. The Committee considered this highlighted the impact of the lomustine discontinuation on those with relapsed high-grade gliomas, as part of the PCV regime.</p><p>2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered however that the primary use of lomustine was in those with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas.

The Committee was informed of data from Te Whatu Ora that reported up to 10% of cases of malignant neoplasms of the brain in 2020 were M\u0101ori. The Committee noted despite similar incidence rates, there have been reports of M\u0101ori waiting 1.32 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.79) times longer to receive radiotherapy, and having poorer median survival times compared to non-M\u0101ori (hazard ratio 1.55 [95% CI 0.95\u20132.55]) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967586810001888?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander et al.

PTAC had considered that the evidence was of poor strength and quality, as the studies did not compare bevacizumab&#39;s use with a control arm, and due to the relatively small number of individuals involved. The Committee noted that PTAC had also deferred making any recommendation for bevacizumab as a combination therapy with lomustine for individuals with relapsed or recurrent gliomas, pending publication of data from the EORTC phase III trial.</p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that lomustine, a treatment used to treat the same population, is being discontinued by the supplier, and that as Pharmac has not been able to secure an alternative brand.</p><h3><em>Health need</em></h3><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that gliomas refer to all forms of intra-axial tumours that originate from glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.1.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the CNS classifies gliomas into grades (I-IV) based on pathological evaluation using molecular information on the malignancy level.</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">4.2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the most common form of high-grade glioma is a grade IV subtype GBM, with grade III glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), a rarer form. The Committee noted that GBM refers to an astrocytoma with WHO grade 4 classification, and an AA is the same tumour type, but with a grade 3 classification. The Committee noted that the determination of grade is related to adverse histologic prognostic factors identified following biopsy.</p><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that clinical presentation of glioma depends on the tumour location and size at diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms and signs at diagnosis are headaches and/or nausea and seizures in the context of a large tumour or significant cerebral oedema. The Committee noted that differentiation of tumour type between grade III or IV usually occurs at surgery, as the clinical symptoms and radiological signs associated with the two tumour types are relatively similar and nonspecific in nature, and noted that both have a poor response to medical management and a poor prognosis (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552189/\" target=\"_blank\">Tian et al, Front Oncol. 2019;9:876</a>).</p><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the 5-year overall relative survival rate for those with GBM is 6.8%, which varies by age at diagnosis and sex, with median overall survival (OS) approximately 10-12 months in a New Zealand population-based studies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8789307/\" target=\"_blank\">McManus, Neurooncol Pract. 2022;9:43-9</a>). The Committee noted that a study that used evidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database reported the overall 5-year survival of AA is reported to be 22%, with the highest 5-year survival rate of 49.9% seen in those in the 15- to 24-year-old age group, and the lowest of 2.5% seen in the 75- to 84-year-old age group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165416/\" target=\"_blank\">Smoll et al, Neuro Oncol. 2014;16:1400-7</a>).</p><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the annual incidence of gliomas is approximately six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Men are 1.6-fold more likely to be diagnosed with gliomas than women, with approximately 5% of gliomas having a familial origin (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293629/\" target=\"_blank\">Weller et al. Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2021;18:170-86</a>). The Committee noted the incidence of malignant gliomas is bimodal with the highest incidence observed in the young and the elderly, the age distribution varying by histological type. GBM is known to have the highest incidence in people aged in their late 60s and early 70s, with frequency then reducing in older age groups. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827837/\" target=\"_blank\">Ostrom et al, Neuro Oncol. 2019; 21:1357-75</a>).

Members had noted that approximately 70% were diagnosed with GBM, and the rest AA.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted individuals with relapsed, recurrent gliomas including AA and GBM present with a variety of largely non-specific symptoms that vary based on the position of the tumour but which can also be accompanied by problems in motor function and speech and commonly epileptic seizures, which reduce quality of life (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. J Basic Med Sci. 2019;19:116-24</a>). In addition, treatment with radiotherapy can reduce the quality of life in some individuals from the associated adverse effects (AEs) such as hair loss, fatigue, somnolence, or cognitive problems, and some may also experience the progression of dementia.</p><p>10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that at present there is no cure for relapsed, recurrent gliomas or GBM, with a life expectancy of 12 to 18 months after diagnosis (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535385/\" target=\"_blank\">Jov\u010devska Bosn et al. 2019</a>).</p><p>11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and prolonging progression free survival (PFS) and survival times. The Committee noted first-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy plus six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy (Stupp regimen). The Committee noted standards of care at recurrence are less well defined. A minority of individuals with recurrence may be offered a second surgery or irradiation treatment if possible. The majority of those affected then progress to systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or temozolomide (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318/\" target=\"_blank\">Schaff et al JAMA. 2023;329:574-87</a>). The Committee noted that temozolomide is funded for people with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas and that funding allows for beyond six cycles of maintenance temozolomide treatment.</p><p>12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a recent study of caregivers of people with a GBM diagnosis that found that performance status is a critical clinical factor that significantly affects caregiver burden, caregiving tasks, and caregiver time.

Brain Tumour Support NZ stated that affected individuals cared about the quality of life, not just the extended survival time.

The Committee considered co-endpoints of PFS and OS indicated an improvement in PFS, however there was no evidence to suggest an increase in survival. The Committee considered that PFS is difficult to measure in gliomas, as there are imaging difficulties measuring cerebral oedema in recurrence. The Committee considered however that while bevacizumab is not a life-extending treatment, it is a corticosteroid sparing agent that can be used to manage and reduce oedema, which can result in clinical improvement in signs and symptoms.</p><p>29.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that given its use and primary efficacy as a corticosteroid sparing agent, bevacizumab would not be a useful replacement for lomustine, which is being discontinued globally.

The Committee considered that the evidence for effects on cerebral oedema was of poor quality and from trials that were negative in their primary endpoints (OS and PFS). The Committee however considered that treatment with bevacizumab would reduce the likelihood of cerebral oedema, and this may result in the increases observed in PFS. However, members considered this unlikely to translate to a benefit in overall survival.\u00a0</p><p>33.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that bevacizumab could be used in combination with carmustine, temozolomide, irinotecan and carboplatin. The Committee considered that the PICO (referred to below) should reflect that the comparator for bevacizumab as monotherapy (in comparison to the addition of bevacizumab to an active agent) would be corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisone. The Committee considered that the rationale for this was based on the reduction in side effects bevacizumab may offer over high dose corticosteroids. The Committee however considered that relevant evidence would be difficult to find, but that the research literature on myeloma could inform these extrapolations.</p><p>34.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that bevacizumab may not result in any significant changes in health-sector expenditure (diagnostic testing, nursing costs or treatment of side effects) except for the additional need for the infusions associated with bevacizumab administration. The Committee estimated that if funded, approximately 50% of people would receive best supportive care, instead of bevacizumab monotherapy or combination therapy.</p><p>35.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that modelling of AE was unlikely to be relevant, as serious AEs are rare and responders have a short survival time to experience any complications with bevacizumab.</p><h3><em>Summary for assessment</em></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">36.</span><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0</span>The Advisory Committee considered that the table below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for bevacizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for individuals with relapsed, recurrent high-grade gliomas who have had a prior first line systemic therapy.

The Committee therefore considered that it would be useful to consider the potential widening of access to temozolomide for this indication, to mitigate some of the impact of the lomustine discontinuation. </p><p>3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered it important to review the evidence supporting the use of temozolomide in both high-grade gliomas upon recurrence and in low-grade gliomas as a replacement product, to inform any potential widening of access to address the unmet need that would result from the discontinuation of lomustine.</p><p>4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the delisting of lomustine should be clearly communicated to the prescribing community as soon as possible, and that it was important to engage with consumer advocacy groups regarding the discontinuation of lomustine. The Committee considered that it would be reasonable, if access to a replacement product were enabled, to limit new individuals commencing treatment with lomustine, to ensure that no one was required to change from lomustine mid-course.</p><p>5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted regorafenib may be an alternative treatment for those currently receiving lomustine. The Committee also noted the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30522967/\" target=\"_blank\">Lombardi et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:110-9</a> randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 2 trial REGOMA study that compared the use of lomustine or regorafenib in those with glioblastoma at first relapse. The Committee considered the trial to be well balanced in trial participant baseline characteristics in each treatment arm. The Committee noted the overall survival was significantly improved in the regorafenib group compared with the lomustine group, with a median overall survival of 7\u00b74 months (95% CI 5\u00b78-12\u00b70) in the regorafenib group and 5\u00b76 months (4\u00b77-7\u00b73) in the lomustine group (hazard ratio 0\u00b750, 95% CI 0\u00b733-0\u00b775; log-rank p=0\u00b70009). The Committee noted that an application to Pharmac for this pharmaceutical has not yet been received.</p><h3><em>Procurement considerations for bevacizumab</em></h3><p>6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted bevacizumab\u2019s utility in the treatment of recurrent glioblastomas is as a steroid sparing agent. The Committee considered that it would therefore not directly replace lomustine in the treatment of gliomas. </p><p>7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted several bevacizumab biosimilars are approved by Medsafe. The Committee noted that there were no concerns regarding the implementation of biosimilar bevacizumab, as no brand is currently funded in New Zealand. </p><p>8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted other indications for the use of bevacizumab have been previously reviewed by either PTAC or CTAC including:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>advanced cervical cancer </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>advanced first line ovarian cancer </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>advanced second line ovarian cancer </p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>metastatic colorectal cancer.</p><p>9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that cancer services\u2019 infusion capacity was a concern in ensuring the equitable implementation and availability of bevacizumab treatment if it were funded.</p>",
