The Committee considered that the implied cost of an infusion is likely to be a significant underestimate of the current cost, given the demands on infusion centres.

Alternative requirements for infusion capacity may well be more complex intravenous regimens with long infusion times. It could not be assumed that there would be a 1:1 individual increase in access to infusion services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that the funding of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab could result in people receiving infliximab earlier in the treatment paradigm for some indications, and that infliximab could therefore displace the use of other biologics.

The Committee considered that the implied cost of an infusion is likely to be a significant underestimate of the current cost, given the demands on infusion centres. Currently, the Committee considered there was likely to be significant variation in infusion costs according to the region of New Zealand; whether the infusion is administered in the public or private sector; and whether individuals required admission to an inpatient facility.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that a potential method for reflecting the impact of infusion capacity constraints in cost-utility analyses was to assume that a proportion of people in the comparator arm were currently receiving no treatment. The Committee noted that this approach was subject to uncertainty, as it was unclear which individuals were more likely to miss out on treatment as a result of infusion constraints.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that one of the challenges to estimating the opportunity for improved infusion center capacity from a shift of individuals to subcutaneous infliximab could arise from the current common short infliximab infusion times. Alternative requirements for infusion capacity may well be more complex intravenous regimens with long infusion times. It could not be assumed that there would be a 1:1 individual increase in access to infusion services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that the funding of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab could result in people receiving infliximab earlier in the treatment paradigm for some indications, and that infliximab could therefore displace the use of other biologics. The Committee considered that the extent to which treatment paradigms may change was uncertain and suggested that it would be useful for Pharmac to seek advice from the relevant Specialist Advisory Committees to inform this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered there may be an increase in demand for laboratory testing of drug levels to support adequate drug dosing and confirm adherence, most likely in the setting of inadequate clinical response to therapy.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Funding criteria</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that should funding of the subcutaneous formulation be progressed any required amendments to the Special Authority criteria for each indication should be considered by the appropriate Special Advisory Committee.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was important to consider whether the proposed funding criteria allows for similar use of dose escalation, as is currently permitted for the intravenous formulation.

The Committee considered that the implied cost of an infusion is likely to be a significant underestimate of the current cost, given the demands on infusion centres. Currently, the Committee considered there was likely to be significant variation in infusion costs according to the region of New Zealand; whether the infusion is administered in the public or private sector; and whether individuals required admission to an inpatient facility.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that a potential method for reflecting the impact of infusion capacity constraints in cost-utility analyses was to assume that a proportion of people in the comparator arm were currently receiving no treatment. The Committee noted that this approach was subject to uncertainty, as it was unclear which individuals were more likely to miss out on treatment as a result of infusion constraints.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that one of the challenges to estimating the opportunity for improved infusion center capacity from a shift of individuals to subcutaneous infliximab could arise from the current common short infliximab infusion times. Alternative requirements for infusion capacity may well be more complex intravenous regimens with long infusion times. It could not be assumed that there would be a 1:1 individual increase in access to infusion services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that the funding of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab could result in people receiving infliximab earlier in the treatment paradigm for some indications, and that infliximab could therefore displace the use of other biologics. The Committee considered that the extent to which treatment paradigms may change was uncertain and suggested that it would be useful for Pharmac to seek advice from the relevant Specialist Advisory Committees to inform this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered there may be an increase in demand for laboratory testing of drug levels to support adequate drug dosing and confirm adherence, most likely in the setting of inadequate clinical response to therapy.</span></p><p><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Funding criteria</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that should funding of the subcutaneous formulation be progressed any required amendments to the Special Authority criteria for each indication should be considered by the appropriate Special Advisory Committee.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: black;\">1.35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Committee considered that it was important to consider whether the proposed funding criteria allows for similar use of dose escalation, as is currently permitted for the intravenous formulation.
