The Committee considered that this change in staging criteria will be seen in future clinical trial protocols and in standard of care guidelines, which may affect interpretation of clinical trial data due to the new classifications use of radiological, rather than pathological, methods for staging.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a US study of patients with stage III melanoma reported 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of at least 63%, 32%, and 11% for stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIIC melanoma, respectively (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479405\" target=\"_blank\">Romano et al. J Clin Oncol. 2010;28:3042-7</a>). The Committee noted data from a single-centre, Australian study in which more than half of stage III melanoma cases had stage I or stage II melanoma which progressed to stage III, and noted that the 5-year RFS was 81.4%, 64.0%, 44.5% and 9.8% for stages IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID, respectively, according to AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28375785\" target=\"_blank\">Haydu et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:1721-9</a>). The Committee considered 5-year RFS was poor in patients with stage IIID disease, however, the data suggested a proportion of patients could potentially be cured by resection alone although this group is not currently clearly defined.</p><p>1.4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that standard care treatment for resectable stage III melanoma in New Zealand consists of curative surgical resection, sentinel lymph node removal and completion lymph node dissection for patients with stage IIIB disease or above. The Committee noted emerging evidence that performing complete lymph node dissection does not increase melanoma-specific survival in patients with melanoma and sentinel-node metastases (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591523\" target=\"_blank\">Faries et al. N Engl J Med. 2017;376:2211-22</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27161539\" target=\"_blank\">Leiter et al. Lancet Oncol. 2016;17:757-67</a>), and this evidence has changed international guidelines; and considered this may affect the applicability of data from clinical trials that included mandatory complete lymph node dissection.</p><p>1.5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that most patients with resected stage III melanoma would be generally well (ECOG score 0), however, they would have a level of psychological distress that is not reported in the current literature, despite the existence of tools to measure this. The Committee noted that males are at higher risk of disease progression, as are patients with a higher stage of disease within the first 2 years after diagnosis. </p><p>1.6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Melanoma in Australia and New Zealand (<a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/melanoma-guideline-nov08-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Cancer Council Australia and Australian Cancer Network, Sydney and New Zealand Guidelines Group, Wellington [2008])</a> recommend observation for completely resected stage I-III melanoma without detail of specific surveillance. The Committee considered that current accepted care for patients whose stage III melanoma has been completely resected is observation only, by skin examination by a medical practitioner with or without ultrasound/radiological assessments. The Committee noted that the type and frequency of radiological assessments (including PET-CT) for surveillance varies between centres, and that use of MRI/CT/PET-CT is influenced by geographic location and access e.g. in the private setting. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment for patients with unresectable or high-risk (stage IV) melanoma includes systemic e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy; or local therapies; e.g. radiotherapy, surgery, which are also given in different settings e.g. adjuvant, neoadjuvant, palliative.\u00a0</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy may be used internationally and in clinical trials for adjuvant treatment of melanoma, intended to reduce the risk of relapse and progression to metastatic disease. The Committee considered that adjuvant therapies are not widely used in New Zealand for resected stage III melanoma and that adjuvant interferon-alpha 2b (which is not funded in New Zealand) can lead to considerable toxicity with only a small benefit in overall survival.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase III CheckMate 238 trial of adjuvant nivolumab compared with ipilimumab in 906 patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma, which reports 1-year RFS of 60.8% with ipilimumab and 70.5% with nivolumab (HR 0.65; 97.56% CI: 0.51 to 0.83; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891423\" target=\"_blank\">Weber et al.

J Clin Oncol. 2018;36(suppl; abstr 9502</a>)). The Committee considered that nivolumab improved overall survival (OS) and had a better toxicity profile than ipilimumab.</p><p><i style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Primary clinical trial evidence</i></p><p>1.10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the pivotal trial evidence for the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab for the treatment of resected stage III melanoma is from the randomised (1:1), phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled KeyNote-054 clinical trial which investigated pembrolizumab (200 mg) compared to placebo every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in 1,019 patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658430?dopt=Abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Eggermont et al.

Members considered that the trial had certainty of staging due to complete lymphadenectomies and pathological staging with AJCC 7<sup>th</sup> Edition, compared to future trials which would be more reliant on radiological staging with AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition. The Committee considered the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were relevant to New Zealand patients except few New Zealand patients may now have complete lymph node dissections in standard care.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median RFS of the KeyNote-054 intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint, was not reached and so not able to be estimated, with pembrolizumab compared to 20.4 months with placebo (95% CI: 16.2 to not estimable). The Committee noted one-year RFS was 75.4% with pembrolizumab compared to 61.0% with placebo: HR 0.57, 98.4% CI: 0.43 to 0.74, P&lt;0.001.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was little difference in RFS between patients with PD-L1 positive tumour status (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.69, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and PD-L1 negative tumour status (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.85, <i>P</i>=0.01) who received pembrolizumab in the KeyNote-054 clinical trial. The Committee considered that the trial data suggests consistent RFS with pembrolizumab across various sub-groups. </p><p>1.14.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the KeyNote-054 trial demonstrated a significant effect on RFS but there is insufficient data to suggest this is associated with a clinically meaningful increase in OS. The Committee considered the quality of life benefits of adjuvant pembrolizumab were uncertain, given that patients with resected stage III melanoma are generally asymptomatic.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median duration of KeyNote-054 trial treatment was 12 months (15.1 months median follow up) and similar proportions of patients completed the treatment regimen in each group, however, 13.8% of pembrolizumab patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity and 35.7% of placebo patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression. The Committee noted that grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in a higher proportion of patients who received pembrolizumab (14.7%), including 1 treatment-related death, than placebo (3.4%).</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that adjuvant pembrolizumab conveys significantly more adverse effects for patients with resected stage III melanoma, including the risk of a significant adverse reaction to immunotherapy. The Committee considered that grade 4 or 5 serious adverse events can be difficult to manage and require hospitalisation, multidisciplinary care and additional treatments e.g. steroids, infliximab. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a subsequent publication which assessed the prognostic and predictive values of AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging on the KeyNote-054 trial patient cohort, reporting 1-year RFS in stage IIIA, IIB, IIIC and IIID of 92.7%, 79.0%, 73.6% and 50.0% respectively (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200321\" target=\"_blank\">Eggermont et al. Eur J Cancer. 2019: 116;148-57</a>). The Committee considered that AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging was strongly associated with RFS but did not have predictive importance for the treatment comparison in regard to RFS (<i>P</i> = 0.68). </p><p>1.18.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that there is limited data for the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab, but since there may be a higher risk of relapse in the first 2-3 years, early treatment of patients diagnosed with stage IIIB melanoma or higher may be more suitable. However, the Committee considered that there is no evidence for whether the OS benefit would be greater with adjuvant pembrolizumab for stage III disease compared to treatment with pembrolizumab in the unresectable stage IV setting that is currently funded.</p><p>1.19.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that the KeyNote-054 trial did not provide data for OS, sequencing of treatment, or evidence of benefit from further pembrolizumab treatment after relapse. The Committee considered that the relevance of the primary trial endpoint (RFS) and the external validity of the KeyNote-054 trial remained uncertain, although the individual trial was of high quality. The Committee noted that data collection is ongoing to address the secondary endpoints of the KeyNote-054 trial including distant metastasis-free survival, OS, safety measures, and measures of health-related quality of life.</p><p><i style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Recurrence-free survival as a surrogate outcome for overall survival </i></p><p>1.20.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of a meta-analysis which included a total of about 5,000 patients with stage II or III melanoma from 11 studies comparing interferon to observation, and 1 study of interferon compared to vaccination (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922786\" target=\"_blank\">Suciu et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2018; 110. Doi: 10.1093/jnci/djx133)</a>. The Committee noted that the authors predicted that a hazard ratio of 0.77 or less for RFS would predict a benefit in OS. </p><p>1.21.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that there is a statistical link between the probability of RFS and OS, although its external validity was unclear.

The Committee considered that this change in staging criteria will be seen in future clinical trial protocols and in standard of care guidelines, which may affect interpretation of clinical trial data due to the new classifications use of radiological, rather than pathological, methods for staging.</p><p>1.3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a US study of patients with stage III melanoma reported 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of at least 63%, 32%, and 11% for stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIIC melanoma, respectively (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479405\" target=\"_blank\">Romano et al. J Clin Oncol. 2010;28:3042-7</a>).

The Committee considered that current accepted care for patients whose stage III melanoma has been completely resected is observation only, by skin examination by a medical practitioner with or without ultrasound/radiological assessments. The Committee noted that the type and frequency of radiological assessments (including PET-CT) for surveillance varies between centres, and that use of MRI/CT/PET-CT is influenced by geographic location and access e.g. in the private setting. </p><p>1.7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that treatment for patients with unresectable or high-risk (stage IV) melanoma includes systemic e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy; or local therapies; e.g. radiotherapy, surgery, which are also given in different settings e.g. adjuvant, neoadjuvant, palliative.\u00a0</p><p>1.8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy may be used internationally and in clinical trials for adjuvant treatment of melanoma, intended to reduce the risk of relapse and progression to metastatic disease. The Committee considered that adjuvant therapies are not widely used in New Zealand for resected stage III melanoma and that adjuvant interferon-alpha 2b (which is not funded in New Zealand) can lead to considerable toxicity with only a small benefit in overall survival.</p><p>1.9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted the results of the randomised, double-blind, phase III CheckMate 238 trial of adjuvant nivolumab compared with ipilimumab in 906 patients with completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma, which reports 1-year RFS of 60.8% with ipilimumab and 70.5% with nivolumab (HR 0.65; 97.56% CI: 0.51 to 0.83; P&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891423\" target=\"_blank\">Weber et al.

Members considered that the trial had certainty of staging due to complete lymphadenectomies and pathological staging with AJCC 7<sup>th</sup> Edition, compared to future trials which would be more reliant on radiological staging with AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition. The Committee considered the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were relevant to New Zealand patients except few New Zealand patients may now have complete lymph node dissections in standard care.</p><p>1.12.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median RFS of the KeyNote-054 intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint, was not reached and so not able to be estimated, with pembrolizumab compared to 20.4 months with placebo (95% CI: 16.2 to not estimable). The Committee noted one-year RFS was 75.4% with pembrolizumab compared to 61.0% with placebo: HR 0.57, 98.4% CI: 0.43 to 0.74, P&lt;0.001.</p><p>1.13.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered there was little difference in RFS between patients with PD-L1 positive tumour status (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.69, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and PD-L1 negative tumour status (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.85, <i>P</i>=0.01) who received pembrolizumab in the KeyNote-054 clinical trial.

The Committee considered the quality of life benefits of adjuvant pembrolizumab were uncertain, given that patients with resected stage III melanoma are generally asymptomatic.</p><p>1.15.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted that the median duration of KeyNote-054 trial treatment was 12 months (15.1 months median follow up) and similar proportions of patients completed the treatment regimen in each group, however, 13.8% of pembrolizumab patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity and 35.7% of placebo patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression. The Committee noted that grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in a higher proportion of patients who received pembrolizumab (14.7%), including 1 treatment-related death, than placebo (3.4%).</p><p>1.16.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee considered that adjuvant pembrolizumab conveys significantly more adverse effects for patients with resected stage III melanoma, including the risk of a significant adverse reaction to immunotherapy. The Committee considered that grade 4 or 5 serious adverse events can be difficult to manage and require hospitalisation, multidisciplinary care and additional treatments e.g. steroids, infliximab. </p><p>1.17.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Committee noted a subsequent publication which assessed the prognostic and predictive values of AJCC 8<sup>th</sup> Edition staging on the KeyNote-054 trial patient cohort, reporting 1-year RFS in stage IIIA, IIB, IIIC and IIID of 92.7%, 79.0%, 73.6% and 50.0% respectively (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200321\" target=\"_blank\">Eggermont et al.

The Subcommittee noted that patients with resected stage III melanoma would not currently receive active treatment as part of standard of care in New Zealand, however, noted that patients whose disease progressed to stage IV may be eligible to receive funded pembrolizumab in the metastatic setting, subject to <a href=\"https://schedule.pharmac.govt.nz/2021/12/01/RS1810.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Special Authority criteria</a>.</p><p>8.12<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of survival data from an Australian study of conditional survival in 2,042 patients with stage III melanoma (<a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2016.71.9393?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">Haydu et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017;35:1721-9</a>) and a retrospective review of 340 US patients with stage III melanoma who eventually relapsed (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/20479405/\" target=\"_blank\">Romano et al. J Clin Oncol. 2010; 28:3042-7</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the conditional survival of patients with melanoma increases with each year of survival, and therefore considered that adjuvant pembrolizumab would likely be of most benefit early in the course of disease.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the five-year survival of patients with metastatic (stage IV) melanoma has improved with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors including pembrolizumab or nivolumab for metastatic melanoma. The Subcommittee was made aware of five-year overall survival (OS) of 34% in patients with metastatic melanoma who received pembrolizumab in the Keynote-001 trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30715153/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamid et al. Ann Oncol. 2019;30:582-8</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the greatest benefit was received in the first two years of treatment and that responses were durable in patients who received a complete response. Members considered that the implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors including pembrolizumab had reduced the usefulness of evidence from historical controls, given that comparison with controls treated without immunotherapy for metastatic disease is inconsistent with current practice.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab was proposed to be administered at a flat dose of 200mg three-weekly for a maximum duration of 12 months. However, the Subcommittee was made aware of emerging evidence for the less frequent pembrolizumab dosing schedule of 400mg six-weekly which could be effective and appropriate in this setting (<a href=\"https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/presentation/10751\" target=\"_blank\">Lala et al. Presented at American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 2020</a>). The Subcommittee considered that pembrolizumab\u2019s relatively large vial size and requirement not to share vials among treated patients would result in wastage and artificially inflate the pharmaceutical\u2019s cost.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided updated evidence from the randomised, phase III, placebo-controlled Keynote-054 trial reporting three-year RFS outcomes, results of a secondary analysis, 3.5 year distant-metastasis free survival (DFMS) outcomes and health-related quality of life data. The Subcommittee noted that the trial design and outcomes from the earlier publications of the Keynote-054 trial had been described by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2019</a> and by CaTSoP in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">October 2019</a>, and that it had been noted that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The AJCC cancer staging was updated to the 8<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> Edition, which included stage IIID disease (previously part of stage IIIC group); the Keynote-054 trial used AJCC 7<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> Edition.

J Clin Oncol. 2020;38:3925-36</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the three-year RFS rate in those with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)\u2013positive tumours was longer with pembrolizumab compared with placebo (HR, 0.57; 99% CI, 0.43 to 0.74). The Subcommittee considered that outcomes did not substantially differ by PD-L1 status, noting the number of patients with PD-L1 negative disease was low. The Subcommittee considered that subgroups were relatively homogenous and that results were similar regardless of AJCC 7<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> or 8<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> Edition staging for stage IIIA disease.

Presented at European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2020</a>). The Subcommittee noted that the 42-months DFMS in PD-L1+ participants was 66.7% with pembrolizumab compared with 51.6% with placebo (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.76; P&lt;0.0001). The Subcommittee considered that a small number of patients were available for follow-up at four years which limited the reliability of these results.</p><p>8.18<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were reported in 190 (37.4%) of patients who received pembrolizumab compared with 45 (9.0%) who received placebo in Keynote-054 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/31895407/\" target=\"_blank\">Eggermont et al. JAMA Oncol. 2020;6:519-27</a>). The Subcommittee noted that about half of the reported irAEs occurred in the first six months of treatment.</p><p>8.19<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that after median follow-up of 15.1 months in Keynote-054, the reported differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores were within the five-point clinical relevance threshold and were clinically non-significant, although compliance with the questionnaire was relatively low (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(21)00081-4\" target=\"_blank\">Bottomley et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:655-64</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the results indicated there was no significant difference in HRQOL between the adjuvant pembrolizumab treated group and the placebo group and noted that the effect of all toxicity (not just irAEs) seemed to occur early in treatment.</p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Keynote-054 trial provided evidence for use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in resected stage III melanoma that was of good quality but unclear strength. The Subcommittee considered that a greater proportion of patients would experience longer disease-free survival with adjuvant pembrolizumab, however, this would be associated a greater rate of immune-related adverse events per 100 patients. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence suggested 16% of patients treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab may not experience later relapse within three years, however,<i> </i>the Keynote-054 trial evidence did not provide survival data to inform whether this results in improvement in long-term survival. The Subcommittee considered that, due to the substantial treatment cross-over, OS data is not expected to eventuate.</p><p>8.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of real-world evidence from 641 patients in the Netherlands who received 12 months of adjuvant pembrolizumab which reported a 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 70% (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-8049(21)00575-X\" target=\"_blank\">De Meza et al. Eur J Cancer. 2021;158:234-45</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the survival data was inconclusive given the limitations of this type of evidence and the short period of follow-up. The Subcommittee noted that early discontinuation occurred in 61% of participants primarily in the first three months due to either progression and/or toxicity; discontinuations at nine to 12 months were primarily due to patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment. The Subcommittee noted explanation for patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment was not provided, although members considered that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in discontinuations. The Subcommittee considered that this patient population was slightly different to the New Zealand patient population with resected stage III melanoma in terms of risk profile (eg lesion resectability, grade and Breslow score), however, considered that the evidence provided evidence of higher toxicity, greater discontinuation rates but similar recurrence rates to those reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that different surrogate endpoints for survival were reported in melanoma trials. The Subcommittee was made aware of publications assessing surrogates for OS in advanced melanoma including PFS and RFS; some of the evidence reported an association between endpoints whilst some did not (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040-8428(19)30044-7\" target=\"_blank\">Branchoux et al. Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2019;137:35-42</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32595775/\" target=\"_blank\">Nie et al. Ther Adv Med Oncol.2020;12:1758835920929583</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27368007/\" target=\"_blank\">Petrelli et al. Medicine (Baltimore). 2016;95:e3997</a>). The Subcommittee considered that there were many contributing factors including the length of follow-up and resulting hazard ratio, and the differences between populations (noting that the forest plots appeared quite consistent but there were differences between patient populations). The Subcommittee considered that there was some evidence of a reasonable correlation between PFS and OS in melanoma, however, no strong data existed for disease-free survival (DFS) or RFS as a surrogate for improved OS. The Subcommittee considered that an association between RFS and OS was theoretical and therefore an OS benefit from increased RFS could not be assumed in cost-effectiveness modelling, however, acknowledged that there could be a moderate correlation between RFS and OS.</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence from a systematic review and network meta-analysis of adjuvant immunotherapy in stages IIC to stage IV melanoma, with regimens including ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, nivolumab/ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib/trametinib (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33680957/\" target=\"_blank\">Christofyllakis et al. Front Oncol. 2020;10:637161</a>). The authors suggested that treatment benefits are cumulative, however, the magnitude of benefit differed by disease stage. The Subcommittee noted that lesser effects were reported in stage IIIA disease compared with stages IIIB and IIIC, and the greatest effect was seen in stage IIIC. The Subcommittee considered that this may suggest there is a class effect of adjuvant immunotherapy agents in this setting, although noted that evidence for specific use of atezolizumab was not identified in melanoma.</p><p>8.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee were not able to determine whether early adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma with 12 months of pembrolizumab improved overall survival compared to later treatment of stage IV disease with 24 months of pembrolizumab.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that subsequent re-treatment</span>/s in the locally advanced or metastatic setting could differ depending on an individual patient\u2019s response and the duration of any treatment received in the adjuvant setting. The Subcommittee <span style=\"color: black;\">noted that </span>one out of 20 patients (5%) <span style=\"color: black;\">in the Keynote-054 trial</span> who had a second course of pembrolizumab post-recurrence received a complete response, and that PFS was limited to 4.1 months for the 20 retreated patients (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-8049(21)00620-1\" target=\"_blank\">Eggermont et al.

The Subcommittee considered that there was limited evidence for a benefit from retreatment with pembrolizumab, ie adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment of stage III followed by retreatment for metastatic stage IV disease. On balance, the Subcommittee considered it reasonable to consider retreatment for patients with metastatic disease who had not relapsed during adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment or within the six months following adjuvant treatment, however, retreatment would likely have a reduced benefit compared to use for treatment-na\u00efve patients.</p><p>8.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the second criterion of the current Special Authority criteria for pembrolizumab/nivolumab for metastatic (stage IV) melanoma would require amendment if pembrolizumab were funded for adjuvant treatment of resected stage III melanoma (proposed changes to relevant Special Authority criteria are shown below in <b>bold</b> and <strike>strikethrough</strike> as applicable):</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">Patient did not experience a recurrence while on treatment or within six months of completing prior therapy with </span><strike style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">pembrolizumab</strike><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> </span><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor</b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> in the resected stage III setting; and</span></p><p>8.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s proposed criteria for adjuvant pembrolizumab were broadly appropriate and that amendments in line with the published evidence (specifically, changes to disease stage sub-types and ECOG scores) were reasonable.</p><p>8.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the increase in health sector costs and referral volumes associated with adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment and monitoring could be significant (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33624271/\" target=\"_blank\">Wurcel et al.

The Subcommittee considered that patients may receive a CT scan after six months of adjuvant treatment for melanoma, at the treating clinician\u2019s discretion. The Subcommittee considered that in some cases, relapsed disease would be clinically identified due to symptomatic progression rather than being identified by routine radiology assessments.</p><p>8.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the </span>most<span style=\"color: black;\"> appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) </span>information<span style=\"color: black;\"> for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for adjuvant treatment of resected stage III melanoma.

The Subcommittee noted that early discontinuation occurred in 61% of participants primarily in the first three months due to either progression and/or toxicity; discontinuations at nine to 12 months were primarily due to patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment. The Subcommittee noted explanation for patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment was not provided, although members considered that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in discontinuations. The Subcommittee considered that this patient population was slightly different to the New Zealand patient population with resected stage III melanoma in terms of risk profile (eg lesion resectability, grade and Breslow score), however, considered that the evidence provided evidence of higher toxicity, greater discontinuation rates but similar recurrence rates to those reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that different surrogate endpoints for survival were reported in melanoma trials.

The Subcommittee considered that there were many contributing factors including the length of follow-up and resulting hazard ratio, and the differences between populations (noting that the forest plots appeared quite consistent but there were differences between patient populations). The Subcommittee considered that there was some evidence of a reasonable correlation between PFS and OS in melanoma, however, no strong data existed for disease-free survival (DFS) or RFS as a surrogate for improved OS. The Subcommittee considered that an association between RFS and OS was theoretical and therefore an OS benefit from increased RFS could not be assumed in cost-effectiveness modelling, however, acknowledged that there could be a moderate correlation between RFS and OS.</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence from a systematic review and network meta-analysis of adjuvant immunotherapy in stages IIC to stage IV melanoma, with regimens including ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, nivolumab/ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib/trametinib (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33680957/\" target=\"_blank\">Christofyllakis et al.

J Clin Oncol. 2010; 28:3042-7</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the conditional survival of patients with melanoma increases with each year of survival, and therefore considered that adjuvant pembrolizumab would likely be of most benefit early in the course of disease.</p><p>8.13<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the five-year survival of patients with metastatic (stage IV) melanoma has improved with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors including pembrolizumab or nivolumab for metastatic melanoma. The Subcommittee was made aware of five-year overall survival (OS) of 34% in patients with metastatic melanoma who received pembrolizumab in the Keynote-001 trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30715153/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamid et al. Ann Oncol. 2019;30:582-8</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the greatest benefit was received in the first two years of treatment and that responses were durable in patients who received a complete response. Members considered that the implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors including pembrolizumab had reduced the usefulness of evidence from historical controls, given that comparison with controls treated without immunotherapy for metastatic disease is inconsistent with current practice.</p><p>8.14<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that pembrolizumab was proposed to be administered at a flat dose of 200mg three-weekly for a maximum duration of 12 months. However, the Subcommittee was made aware of emerging evidence for the less frequent pembrolizumab dosing schedule of 400mg six-weekly which could be effective and appropriate in this setting (<a href=\"https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/presentation/10751\" target=\"_blank\">Lala et al. Presented at American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 2020</a>). The Subcommittee considered that pembrolizumab\u2019s relatively large vial size and requirement not to share vials among treated patients would result in wastage and artificially inflate the pharmaceutical\u2019s cost.</p><p>8.15<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier provided updated evidence from the randomised, phase III, placebo-controlled Keynote-054 trial reporting three-year RFS outcomes, results of a secondary analysis, 3.5 year distant-metastasis free survival (DFMS) outcomes and health-related quality of life data. The Subcommittee noted that the trial design and outcomes from the earlier publications of the Keynote-054 trial had been described by PTAC in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 2019</a> and by CaTSoP in <a href=\"https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-cancer-treatment-subcommittee-record-2019-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">October 2019</a>, and that it had been noted that:</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The AJCC cancer staging was updated to the 8<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> Edition, which included stage IIID disease (previously part of stage IIIC group); the Keynote-054 trial used AJCC 7<span style=\"font-size: 9.75px;\">th</span> Edition.

Lancet Oncol. 2021;22:655-64</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the results indicated there was no significant difference in HRQOL between the adjuvant pembrolizumab treated group and the placebo group and noted that the effect of all toxicity (not just irAEs) seemed to occur early in treatment.</p><p>8.20<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the Keynote-054 trial provided evidence for use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in resected stage III melanoma that was of good quality but unclear strength. The Subcommittee considered that a greater proportion of patients would experience longer disease-free survival with adjuvant pembrolizumab, however, this would be associated a greater rate of immune-related adverse events per 100 patients. The Subcommittee considered that the evidence suggested 16% of patients treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab may not experience later relapse within three years, however,<i> </i>the Keynote-054 trial evidence did not provide survival data to inform whether this results in improvement in long-term survival. The Subcommittee considered that, due to the substantial treatment cross-over, OS data is not expected to eventuate.</p><p>8.21<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of real-world evidence from 641 patients in the Netherlands who received 12 months of adjuvant pembrolizumab which reported a 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 70% (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-8049(21)00575-X\" target=\"_blank\">De Meza et al. Eur J Cancer. 2021;158:234-45</a>). The Subcommittee considered that the survival data was inconclusive given the limitations of this type of evidence and the short period of follow-up. The Subcommittee noted that early discontinuation occurred in 61% of participants primarily in the first three months due to either progression and/or toxicity; discontinuations at nine to 12 months were primarily due to patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment. The Subcommittee noted explanation for patient and clinician agreement to cease treatment was not provided, although members considered that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in discontinuations. The Subcommittee considered that this patient population was slightly different to the New Zealand patient population with resected stage III melanoma in terms of risk profile (eg lesion resectability, grade and Breslow score), however, considered that the evidence provided evidence of higher toxicity, greater discontinuation rates but similar recurrence rates to those reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>8.22<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that different surrogate endpoints for survival were reported in melanoma trials. The Subcommittee was made aware of publications assessing surrogates for OS in advanced melanoma including PFS and RFS; some of the evidence reported an association between endpoints whilst some did not (<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040-8428(19)30044-7\" target=\"_blank\">Branchoux et al.

The Subcommittee considered that there were many contributing factors including the length of follow-up and resulting hazard ratio, and the differences between populations (noting that the forest plots appeared quite consistent but there were differences between patient populations). The Subcommittee considered that there was some evidence of a reasonable correlation between PFS and OS in melanoma, however, no strong data existed for disease-free survival (DFS) or RFS as a surrogate for improved OS. The Subcommittee considered that an association between RFS and OS was theoretical and therefore an OS benefit from increased RFS could not be assumed in cost-effectiveness modelling, however, acknowledged that there could be a moderate correlation between RFS and OS.</p><p>8.23<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence from a systematic review and network meta-analysis of adjuvant immunotherapy in stages IIC to stage IV melanoma, with regimens including ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, nivolumab/ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib/trametinib (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33680957/\" target=\"_blank\">Christofyllakis et al. Front Oncol. 2020;10:637161</a>). The authors suggested that treatment benefits are cumulative, however, the magnitude of benefit differed by disease stage. The Subcommittee noted that lesser effects were reported in stage IIIA disease compared with stages IIIB and IIIC, and the greatest effect was seen in stage IIIC. The Subcommittee considered that this may suggest there is a class effect of adjuvant immunotherapy agents in this setting, although noted that evidence for specific use of atezolizumab was not identified in melanoma.</p><p>8.24<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee were not able to determine whether early adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma with 12 months of pembrolizumab improved overall survival compared to later treatment of stage IV disease with 24 months of pembrolizumab.</p><p>8.25<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that subsequent re-treatment</span>/s in the locally advanced or metastatic setting could differ depending on an individual patient\u2019s response and the duration of any treatment received in the adjuvant setting.

The Subcommittee considered that there was limited evidence for a benefit from retreatment with pembrolizumab, ie adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment of stage III followed by retreatment for metastatic stage IV disease. On balance, the Subcommittee considered it reasonable to consider retreatment for patients with metastatic disease who had not relapsed during adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment or within the six months following adjuvant treatment, however, retreatment would likely have a reduced benefit compared to use for treatment-na\u00efve patients.</p><p>8.26<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the second criterion of the current Special Authority criteria for pembrolizumab/nivolumab for metastatic (stage IV) melanoma would require amendment if pembrolizumab were funded for adjuvant treatment of resected stage III melanoma (proposed changes to relevant Special Authority criteria are shown below in <b>bold</b> and <strike>strikethrough</strike> as applicable):</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">Patient did not experience a recurrence while on treatment or within six months of completing prior therapy with </span><strike style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">pembrolizumab</strike><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> </span><b style=\"font-size: 9pt;\">a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor</b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;\"> in the resected stage III setting; and</span></p><p>8.27<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the supplier\u2019s proposed criteria for adjuvant pembrolizumab were broadly appropriate and that amendments in line with the published evidence (specifically, changes to disease stage sub-types and ECOG scores) were reasonable.</p><p>8.28<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the increase in health sector costs and referral volumes associated with adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment and monitoring could be significant (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33624271/\" target=\"_blank\">Wurcel et al.

J Med Econ. 2019;22:981-93</a>), and that this could include high-cost radiology assessments including PET scans, however, the Subcommittee considered that regular monitoring for patients in observation also incurred a high cost to the health system. The Subcommittee considered that patients may receive a CT scan after six months of adjuvant treatment for melanoma, at the treating clinician\u2019s discretion. The Subcommittee considered that in some cases, relapsed disease would be clinically identified due to symptomatic progression rather than being identified by routine radiology assessments.</p><p>8.29<span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the </span>most<span style=\"color: black;\"> appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) </span>information<span style=\"color: black;\"> for pembrolizumab if it were to be funded in New Zealand for adjuvant treatment of resected stage III melanoma.
