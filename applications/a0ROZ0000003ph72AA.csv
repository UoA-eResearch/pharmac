The Committee noted that, once this has successfully occurred, the dose of methotrexate can then also usually be tapered down over approximately three months. The Committee noted that there was some evidence for using leflunomide or azathioprine second line, but that their use was not recommended in the BSR guidelines.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the prognosis for individuals with PMR is usually good and complications, such as recurrent, or ongoing, relapses of symptoms, are limited.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted morbidity in PMR most often relates to the longer-term impact of its treatment (ie glucocorticoids) (<a href=""https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica#H2"" target=""_blank"">Salvarani et al.

The Committee noted that the primary endpoint of relapse-free remission without glucocorticoid treatment at 6 months was reached in all 9 individuals in whom the primary endpoint assessed. The Committee noted that disease remained in remission throughout the trial in all 9 patients who completed the entire 15-month trial. The Committee noted that a cohort of 10 consecutively evaluated patients with newly diagnosed PMR served as a comparator group, and that none of this group were in remission without glucocorticoids by 6 months; remission or low disease activity was observed in all 10 patients, but they were all still receiving low-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27159185/"" target=""_blank"">Lally et al.

The Committee noted that individuals were given tocilizumab 8 mg/kg via three IV infusions at baseline, week 4, and week 8, followed by oral prednisone 0.15 mg/kg daily from weeks 12 to 24. The Committee noted that the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PMR-AS ≤10 at week 12. The Committee noted that at week 12, all patients had PMR-AS ≤10 and received low-dose prednisone, median starting dosage was 12 mg (interquartile range [IQR] 9.0 to 12.5). The Committee noted that at weeks 12 and 24 median PMR-AS improved from 4.50 (IQR 3.2 to 6.8) to 0.95 (IQR 0.4 to 2.0)..

The Committee noted that disease remained in remission throughout the trial in all 9 patients who completed the entire 15-month trial. The Committee noted that a cohort of 10 consecutively evaluated patients with newly diagnosed PMR served as a comparator group, and that none of this group were in remission without glucocorticoids by 6 months; remission or low disease activity was observed in all 10 patients, but they were all still receiving low-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27159185/"" target=""_blank"">Lally et al.
