The Committee considered that this barrier would likely disproportionately affect Māori given socioeconomic factors for this population. The Committee also considered that Māori are more likely to live in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation with lower grade housing, which may increase susceptibility to developing dermatitis. The Committee noted that that treatment of atopic dermatitis is not currently a Government health priority.</p><p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.6.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic, relapsing, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease which occurs more frequently in children than adults. The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis is a complex condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is characterised by cutaneous inflammation, immune dysregulation, and epidermal barrier dysfunction. The Committee noted that complications that arise from atopic dermatitis including a higher susceptibility to skin infections. The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis has a significant psychosocial and quality-of-life impact, causing emotional as well as physical distress.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a UK population-based study using GP data reporting on the prevalence of eczema (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33179341/"" target=""_blank"">Lusignan et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 2021;51:471-82</a>). The Committee noted that eczema had a bimodal distribution across the lifespan and that differences in the incidence and prevalence of eczema by ethnicity, geography, sex, and socio-economic status varied in magnitude throughout the life course. The Committee noted another prevalence study, based on Australian data, which indicated that the overall prevalence of eczema is 6.3%, which would equate to approximately 312,800 people in New Zealand in 2022 (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajd.13268"" target=""_blank"">Chidwick et al. Australian Journal of Dermatology. 2020;61:319-327</a>). The Committee also noted that Chidwick et al. reported that 84.4% of individuals with atopic dermatitis are aged 12 and over, and that 21.4% of the population affected by eczema have moderate to severe eczema. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.8.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that the Dermatology Subcommittee reviewed an application for topical pimecrolimus for atopic dermatitis in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-dermatology-subcommittee-minutes-2017-11.pdf"" target=""_blank"">October 2017</a> and stated that atopic dermatitis is a common disease affecting up to 20% of children and 5% of adults, with a prevalence of 15% and 16%, respectively, in Māori children and Pacific children. The Committee noted that environmental factors influence the occurrence of atopic dermatitis, and that living in damp and leaky homes is associated with development of atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that moderate to severe atopic dermatitis can be defined in multiple ways including, but not limited to, physical assessment of disease severity (physician’s global assessment (PGA)), Eczema Area &amp; Severity Index (EASI), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and quality-of-life measures such as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The Committee noted that EASI is one of the most commonly used measures and consists of a simple scoring system to assess the extent and severity of eczema and noted that a score of upwards of 7.1 indicated moderate disease, and a score of 21.1 or more indicated severe disease. The Committee considered that a 75% decrease in EASI score (EASI75) correlates to a significant decrease in symptom burden and considered that this would be associated with a positive impact on patient quality of life. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that PGA is scored from 0 to 4, with a score of 3 indicating moderate, and 4 indicating severe disease. The Committee noted that POEM scoring has a maximum score of 28, and that a score of 8 to 16 indicates moderate eczema, and that 17 or above indicates severe disease. The Committee noted that DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire with a maximum score of 30; a score of ≥10 is considered severe; a change in score of 4 or more is considered the minimal clinically important change (MCID). </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is currently treated with emollients, topical corticosteroids, and for facial atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. The Committee noted that patients who do not see a response with topical treatments are offered systemic immunosuppressant therapy with ciclosporin, as well as treatments that are not specifically approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. The Committee noted that phototherapy can also be beneficial to patients but noted that access to this is limited in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the evidence of benefit is limited. The Committee noted that patients are likely to be referred to specialist secondary care if they require systemic therapy or standard flare management protocols are not providing adequate benefit. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Australian Consensus Guidelines for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis suggest systemic immunosuppressants be used secondarily to flare-management protocol, but do not specify the order in which respective immunosuppressants should be used if one, or more, are not tolerated or effective (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31372984/"" target=""_blank"">Smith et al. Australas J Dermatol. 2020;61:23-32</a>). The Committee also noted a review by Rademaker et al. which specified that systemic therapy should be an option for all patients with atopic dermatitis where their quality of life is impacted significantly, and that due to the high cost of newer emerging agents, any new agents are likely to remain second-line to conventional systemic therapies (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31529493/"" target=""_blank"">Rademaker et al. Australas J Dermatol. 2020;61:9-22</a>). The Committee noted that Rademaker et al stated in their review that “patients should have tried and failed, or be contraindicated, to conventional systemic therapies (at least two of phototherapy, ciclosporin, methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate), over a period of at least 6 months, before considering one of the newer agents.”</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.13.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>\xa0The Committee noted a published technology assessment by <a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta534"" target=""_blank"">NICE in 2018</a> for the monoclonal antibody dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The Committee noted that dupilumab is recommended by NICE as an option for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis if the disease has not responded to at least one other systemic therapy. The Committee noted that dupilumab is an IL4 inhibitor, which targets cytokine signalling via Th2 inhibition which initiates and maintains abnormal inflammatory pathways. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted a review article from 2021 which outlines the variable pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, as well as novel therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, which target different cellular and immunologic processes (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33911806/"" target=""_blank"">Ahn et al. Ann Dermatol. 2021;33:1-10</a>).\xa0The Committee noted janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, a category of small molecules, are known to be well tolerated when used in the treatment of other inflammatory indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The Committee noted that JAK inhibitors as a class have uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects, the most common of which are infections such as herpes zoster and tuberculosis. The Committee considered that a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine would be appropriate for patients on immunosuppressive treatments. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is a reversible JAK1 selective inhibitor which is taken once daily at a dose of 15 or 30 mg for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The Committee noted that the applicant’s submission did not provide any publications of comparisons of upadacitinib against current standard of care with systemic therapies but provided an indirect comparison of dupilumab versus systemic therapy. The committee noted that upadacitinib is funded for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis subject to a special authority.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.16.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that in the United States, there is a black box warning associated with upadacitinib that notes the occurrence of serious infections, lymphoma, and other malignancies that have been observed in patients treated with upadacitinib and that the warning also notes that thrombosis has occurred in patients treated with JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions (not specific to upadacitinib). The Committee noted that upadacitinib had Medsafe approval for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.17.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and safety of systemic immunomodulatory treatments for patients with atopic dermatitis (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32320001/"" target=""_blank"">Drucker et al. JAMA Dermatol. 2020;156:659-67</a>). The Committee noted that upadacitinib 15mg and 30mg daily, but not 7.5 mg, was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in POEM score compared with placebo. The Committee also noted that treatment with dupilumab was associated with improvement in the EASI score versus placebo (mean difference 11.3-point reduction; 95% credible interval 9.7-13.1). The Committee noted that cyclosporin and dupilumab were similarly effective versus placebo in clearing clinical signs of atopic dermatitis and may be superior to methotrexate (standardized mean difference, −0.6; 95% credible interval −1.1 to 0.0) and azathioprine (standardized mean difference, −0.4; 95% credible interval, −0.8 to −0.1). The Committee noted that all treatments listed were more effective than placebo in managing atopic dermatitis. The Committee noted that most studies included in the Drucker et al. analysis and review were of 16-week duration and considered that there was a lack of studies directly comparing established and novel treatments beyond 16 weeks. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the pivotal evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: </p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">7.18.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34023009/"" target=""_blank"">Reich et al.

The Committee noted that access to specialist dermatology services is a significant barrier to receiving treatment and considered that this barrier would likely disproportionately affect Māori and Pacific peoples given socioeconomic factors for these populations. The Committee considered that upadacitinib would need to be initiated in secondary care (specialist dermatology services) given the requirement to have tried at least one other systemic therapy initiated in secondary care recognising the difficulties in equity of access to treatment this might cause.

The Committee noted that some longer-term safety data is available from the use of upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis.

The Committee considered, however, that the majority of hospitalisations occur in children under the age of five and are related to secondary infections, and that these patients may not be eligible for upadacitinib. The Committee also considered it was not appropriate to extrapolate a reduction in hospitalisations from overseas (such as in the UK) given the lower rates of dermatology related hospitalisations in New Zealand and limited availability of dermatologists. Therefore, the Committee considered that hospitalisation rates may not be an appropriate metric in cost analysis.

The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis is a complex condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is characterised by cutaneous inflammation, immune dysregulation, and epidermal barrier dysfunction. The Committee noted that complications that arise from atopic dermatitis including a higher susceptibility to skin infections.

The Committee noted that eczema had a bimodal distribution across the lifespan and that differences in the incidence and prevalence of eczema by ethnicity, geography, sex, and socio-economic status varied in magnitude throughout the life course. The Committee noted another prevalence study, based on Australian data, which indicated that the overall prevalence of eczema is 6.3%, which would equate to approximately 312,800 people in New Zealand in 2022 (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajd.13268"" target=""_blank"">Chidwick et al.

The Committee noted that environmental factors influence the occurrence of atopic dermatitis, and that living in damp and leaky homes is associated with development of atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that moderate to severe atopic dermatitis can be defined in multiple ways including, but not limited to, physical assessment of disease severity (physician’s global assessment (PGA)), Eczema Area &amp; Severity Index (EASI), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and quality-of-life measures such as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The Committee noted that EASI is one of the most commonly used measures and consists of a simple scoring system to assess the extent and severity of eczema and noted that a score of upwards of 7.1 indicated moderate disease, and a score of 21.1 or more indicated severe disease. The Committee considered that a 75% decrease in EASI score (EASI75) correlates to a significant decrease in symptom burden and considered that this would be associated with a positive impact on patient quality of life. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that PGA is scored from 0 to 4, with a score of 3 indicating moderate, and 4 indicating severe disease.

The Committee considered a recommendation regarding use in patients under the age of 12 years required further consideration and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety profile in this age group.

Asia Pac Allergy. 2013;3:161-78</a>). The Committee noted that access to specialist dermatology services is a significant barrier to receiving treatment and considered that this barrier would likely disproportionately affect Māori and Pacific peoples given socioeconomic factors for these populations. The Committee considered that upadacitinib would need to be initiated in secondary care (specialist dermatology services) given the requirement to have tried at least one other systemic therapy initiated in secondary care recognising the difficulties in equity of access to treatment this might cause. The Committee considered that advice should be sought from the Dermatology Subcommittee on the best placement of upadacitinib in the treatment sequence and the prescriber restrictions which would support practical access to upadacitinib for the intended population. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adherence to treatment is likely to be high in patients due to rapid effect of upadacitinib but considered that patients may stop taking treatment once their atopic dermatitis is controlled and their symptom burden is low. The Committee considered that, as atopic dermatitis is relapsing in nature, that patients may stop and start treatment depending on flare-ups and control of symptoms between flare ups. The Committee considered that advice should be sought from the Dermatology Subcommittee regarding the appropriateness of short treatment duration in accordance with flares. The Committee considered that there is limited long-term evidence for upadacitinib, and that it is unclear how long upadacitinib would have an effect after treatment is stopped.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that acne as a side effect of upadacitinib would not be a reason for most patients to discontinue use of upadacitinib. The Committee noted that currently available JAK inhibitors seem to have slightly different effects, and so long-term safety and efficacy for upadacitinib should not be extrapolated based on the other agents. The Committee noted that some longer-term safety data is available from the use of upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. The Committee also considered that it is unclear if there would be a bypass mechanism for upadacitinib but noted that there is no data to suggest that there may be development of resistance over time.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.28.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if upadacitinib were funded, hospitalisations and GP visits due to atopic dermatitis may decrease which would lead to health sector savings. The Committee considered, however, that the majority of hospitalisations occur in children under the age of five and are related to secondary infections, and that these patients may not be eligible for upadacitinib. The Committee also considered it was not appropriate to extrapolate a reduction in hospitalisations from overseas (such as in the UK) given the lower rates of dermatology related hospitalisations in New Zealand and limited availability of dermatologists. Therefore, the Committee considered that hospitalisation rates may not be an appropriate metric in cost analysis. The Committee considered that EASI75 relates to significant quality of life improvements for patients, and that this is an appropriate measure of improvement for patients with atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.29.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The committee considered the utility values used in <a href=""https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Zimmermann-2018_AD.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Zimmerman et al.

The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis is a complex condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is characterised by cutaneous inflammation, immune dysregulation, and epidermal barrier dysfunction. The Committee noted that complications that arise from atopic dermatitis including a higher susceptibility to skin infections. The Committee noted that atopic dermatitis has a significant psychosocial and quality-of-life impact, causing emotional as well as physical distress.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.7.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted a UK population-based study using GP data reporting on the prevalence of eczema (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33179341/"" target=""_blank"">Lusignan et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 2021;51:471-82</a>). The Committee noted that eczema had a bimodal distribution across the lifespan and that differences in the incidence and prevalence of eczema by ethnicity, geography, sex, and socio-economic status varied in magnitude throughout the life course. The Committee noted another prevalence study, based on Australian data, which indicated that the overall prevalence of eczema is 6.3%, which would equate to approximately 312,800 people in New Zealand in 2022 (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajd.13268"" target=""_blank"">Chidwick et al. Australian Journal of Dermatology. 2020;61:319-327</a>).

The Committee noted that environmental factors influence the occurrence of atopic dermatitis, and that living in damp and leaky homes is associated with development of atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.9.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that moderate to severe atopic dermatitis can be defined in multiple ways including, but not limited to, physical assessment of disease severity (physician’s global assessment (PGA)), Eczema Area &amp; Severity Index (EASI), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and quality-of-life measures such as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The Committee noted that EASI is one of the most commonly used measures and consists of a simple scoring system to assess the extent and severity of eczema and noted that a score of upwards of 7.1 indicated moderate disease, and a score of 21.1 or more indicated severe disease. The Committee considered that a 75% decrease in EASI score (EASI75) correlates to a significant decrease in symptom burden and considered that this would be associated with a positive impact on patient quality of life. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.10.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that PGA is scored from 0 to 4, with a score of 3 indicating moderate, and 4 indicating severe disease. The Committee noted that POEM scoring has a maximum score of 28, and that a score of 8 to 16 indicates moderate eczema, and that 17 or above indicates severe disease. The Committee noted that DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire with a maximum score of 30; a score of ≥10 is considered severe; a change in score of 4 or more is considered the minimal clinically important change (MCID). </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.11.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is currently treated with emollients, topical corticosteroids, and for facial atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. The Committee noted that patients who do not see a response with topical treatments are offered systemic immunosuppressant therapy with ciclosporin, as well as treatments that are not specifically approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. The Committee noted that phototherapy can also be beneficial to patients but noted that access to this is limited in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the evidence of benefit is limited. The Committee noted that patients are likely to be referred to specialist secondary care if they require systemic therapy or standard flare management protocols are not providing adequate benefit. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.12.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that Australian Consensus Guidelines for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis suggest systemic immunosuppressants be used secondarily to flare-management protocol, but do not specify the order in which respective immunosuppressants should be used if one, or more, are not tolerated or effective (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31372984/"" target=""_blank"">Smith et al. Australas J Dermatol. 2020;61:23-32</a>). The Committee also noted a review by Rademaker et al. which specified that systemic therapy should be an option for all patients with atopic dermatitis where their quality of life is impacted significantly, and that due to the high cost of newer emerging agents, any new agents are likely to remain second-line to conventional systemic therapies (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31529493/"" target=""_blank"">Rademaker et al. Australas J Dermatol. 2020;61:9-22</a>).

The Committee noted that dupilumab is recommended by NICE as an option for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis if the disease has not responded to at least one other systemic therapy. The Committee noted that dupilumab is an IL4 inhibitor, which targets cytokine signalling via Th2 inhibition which initiates and maintains abnormal inflammatory pathways. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.14.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted a review article from 2021 which outlines the variable pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, as well as novel therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, which target different cellular and immunologic processes (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33911806/"" target=""_blank"">Ahn et al. Ann Dermatol. 2021;33:1-10</a>).\xa0The Committee noted janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, a category of small molecules, are known to be well tolerated when used in the treatment of other inflammatory indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The Committee noted that JAK inhibitors as a class have uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects, the most common of which are infections such as herpes zoster and tuberculosis. The Committee considered that a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine would be appropriate for patients on immunosuppressive treatments. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.15.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that upadacitinib is a reversible JAK1 selective inhibitor which is taken once daily at a dose of 15 or 30 mg for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The Committee noted that the applicant’s submission did not provide any publications of comparisons of upadacitinib against current standard of care with systemic therapies but provided an indirect comparison of dupilumab versus systemic therapy.

JAMA Dermatol. 2020;156:659-67</a>). The Committee noted that upadacitinib 15mg and 30mg daily, but not 7.5 mg, was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in POEM score compared with placebo. The Committee also noted that treatment with dupilumab was associated with improvement in the EASI score versus placebo (mean difference 11.3-point reduction; 95% credible interval 9.7-13.1). The Committee noted that cyclosporin and dupilumab were similarly effective versus placebo in clearing clinical signs of atopic dermatitis and may be superior to methotrexate (standardized mean difference, −0.6; 95% credible interval −1.1 to 0.0) and azathioprine (standardized mean difference, −0.4; 95% credible interval, −0.8 to −0.1). The Committee noted that all treatments listed were more effective than placebo in managing atopic dermatitis. The Committee noted that most studies included in the Drucker et al. analysis and review were of 16-week duration and considered that there was a lack of studies directly comparing established and novel treatments beyond 16 weeks. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.18.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the pivotal evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: </p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">7.18.1.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34023009/"" target=""_blank"">Reich et al.

JAMA Dermatol. 2021;157:1047-55</a>). The Committee noted that rescue therapy, defined as any topical or systemic immunomodulatory treatment initiated for atopic dermatitis, could be given at any time per investigator discretion and that patients who received rescue therapy were considered non-responders for binary end points after the initiation of rescue therapy. The Committee noted that the primary outcome of the trial was EASI75 and that at week 16, 247 patients receiving upadacitinib (71.0%) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab (61.1%) achieved EASI75 (P = 0.006). The Committee noted that patients receiving upadacitinib also had a significantly reduced itch score compared to those taking dupilumab. The Committee noted that the patient characteristics were similar to those reported in the above upadacitinib trials, but that previous systemic therapy was not reported. The Committee noted that the adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the known safety profiles of each drug. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.21.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted a systematic review and network meta-analysis on the short-term efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34575076/"" target=""_blank"">Pereyra-Rodriguez et al. Life (Basel). 2021;11:927</a>). The Committee noted that upadacitinib was rated highly in achieving EASI75 both as monotherapy and in combination with topical corticosteroids, but that the drugs with the highest probability of presenting adverse effects were the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, upadacitinib and abrocitinib in monotherapy and baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.22.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the strength and quality of evidence for upadacitinib in the treatment of atopic dermatitis is good but noted that there is no evidence for treatment in those under the age of 12, and that there is currently no Medsafe approval for upadacitinib for this age group. The Committee considered a recommendation regarding use in patients under the age of 12 years required further consideration and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety profile in this age group.

Asia Pac Allergy. 2013;3:161-78</a>). The Committee noted that access to specialist dermatology services is a significant barrier to receiving treatment and considered that this barrier would likely disproportionately affect Māori and Pacific peoples given socioeconomic factors for these populations. The Committee considered that upadacitinib would need to be initiated in secondary care (specialist dermatology services) given the requirement to have tried at least one other systemic therapy initiated in secondary care recognising the difficulties in equity of access to treatment this might cause. The Committee considered that advice should be sought from the Dermatology Subcommittee on the best placement of upadacitinib in the treatment sequence and the prescriber restrictions which would support practical access to upadacitinib for the intended population. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.26.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that adherence to treatment is likely to be high in patients due to rapid effect of upadacitinib but considered that patients may stop taking treatment once their atopic dermatitis is controlled and their symptom burden is low. The Committee considered that, as atopic dermatitis is relapsing in nature, that patients may stop and start treatment depending on flare-ups and control of symptoms between flare ups. The Committee considered that advice should be sought from the Dermatology Subcommittee regarding the appropriateness of short treatment duration in accordance with flares. The Committee considered that there is limited long-term evidence for upadacitinib, and that it is unclear how long upadacitinib would have an effect after treatment is stopped.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.27.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that acne as a side effect of upadacitinib would not be a reason for most patients to discontinue use of upadacitinib. The Committee noted that currently available JAK inhibitors seem to have slightly different effects, and so long-term safety and efficacy for upadacitinib should not be extrapolated based on the other agents. The Committee noted that some longer-term safety data is available from the use of upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. The Committee also considered that it is unclear if there would be a bypass mechanism for upadacitinib but noted that there is no data to suggest that there may be development of resistance over time.</p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.28.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if upadacitinib were funded, hospitalisations and GP visits due to atopic dermatitis may decrease which would lead to health sector savings. The Committee considered, however, that the majority of hospitalisations occur in children under the age of five and are related to secondary infections, and that these patients may not be eligible for upadacitinib. The Committee also considered it was not appropriate to extrapolate a reduction in hospitalisations from overseas (such as in the UK) given the lower rates of dermatology related hospitalisations in New Zealand and limited availability of dermatologists. Therefore, the Committee considered that hospitalisation rates may not be an appropriate metric in cost analysis. The Committee considered that EASI75 relates to significant quality of life improvements for patients, and that this is an appropriate measure of improvement for patients with atopic dermatitis. </p><p><span style=""color: black;"">7.29.</span><span style=""color: black; font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The committee considered the utility values used in <a href=""https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Zimmermann-2018_AD.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Zimmerman et al.
