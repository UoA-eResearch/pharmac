Alternatively, patients would receive a thalidomide-based regimen, which would consist of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) or melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT), all for approximately six to 12 cycles. The Subcommittee noted that patients could be eligible for lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression if neuropathy prevents use of bortezomib and thalidomide-based regimens. The Subcommittee noted that in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, if remission was for greater than two to three years, and the patient was transplant eligible, a second autologous stem cell transplant would be offered.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.3.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the choice of second-line regimen would be determined by the duration of response to first-line treatment, toxicities experienced in the first-line, and patient-specific factors including the desire for oral therapy.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.4.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that once a patient progresses after second line therapy, if they had received an autologous stem cell transplant with lenalidomide maintenance there are no further options for this patient group. The Subcommittee noted that lenalidomide with dexamethasone with or without bortezomib was a third-line treatment option, only for transplant-ineligible patients who had not received lenalidomide maintenance post autologous stem cell transplant. </p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.5.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of data reporting progression-free survival (PFS) of around eight months with bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma, from two clinical trials, and considered the efficacy of bortezomib retreatment after first-line bortezomib to be limited: </p><p><span style=\"font-family: Symbol;\">\u00b7</span><span style=\"font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>A 6.5-month duration of response was reported in 130 patients who received bortezomib with or without dexamethasone after median two prior lines of therapy (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.12198\" target=\"_blank\">Petrucci et al.

About 45% of patients had received one prior line, and about 70% of patients had prior bortezomib exposure (<a href=\"http://www.haematologica.org/content/103/12/2079.long\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer et al.

The Subcommittee considered it reasonable to assume that outcomes would be similar to that observed in patients retreated with bortezomib.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.7.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee was made aware of evidence that a significant number of patients (about 50%) progress on lenalidomide maintenance and have few subsequent treatment options, as they are unlikely to receive a response from thalidomide and early relapse after prior bortezomib treatment makes its use in retreatment less likely to be successful (<a href=\"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/134/Supplement_1/1779/427686/Outcomes-in-Multiple-Myeloma-Patients-Progressing\" target=\"_blank\">Sanchez et al.

The Subcommittee considered the unmet need for treatments in later lines of therapy was also high, but that the number of patients requiring treatment in this context was less, and that there would be a proportion of patients who would remain eligible for lenalidomide-based treatment in this setting.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.9.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee noted that multiple myeloma treatment is evolving internationally with use of other combinations and other treatments, and was made aware of international clinical guidelines that recommend second-line treatments or combinations that are not funded in New Zealand (<a href=\"https://jnccn.org/doi/10.6004/jnccn.2018.0002\" target=\"_blank\">Kumar et al.

However, the Subcommittee considered this estimate was likely too high for second- or third-line patients, as transplant eligibility decreases over time given the age of patients at initial diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that in time, the funded use of lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting would be indicative of the proportion of patients who are ineligible for transplant in third-line setting. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 400 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year and considered that approximately 50% would initially be eligible for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that on this basis there would be approximately 130 patients who would relapse post-transplant each year; that there would be approximately 150 patients who would relapse after first line treatment if ineligible for transplant each year; and there would be approximately 170 patients who would require treatment in the third line setting each year.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of cycles received will depend on PFS which is influenced by prior lines of therapy and the proportion of patients whose disease was refractory, therefore the treatment cost per cycle would be most useful for cost-effectiveness assessment, as opposed to cost per treatment, given the variable extent of pre-treatment in the clinical trials.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for second-line treatment, comparators could be bortezomib retreatment as CyBorD/BTD, or MPT and CTD. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of interest in this setting was improved PFS (above that gained from bortezomib retreatment). The Subcommittee considered the most appropriate comparator for use in the second-line would be BTD, unless the patient could not tolerate bortezomib, in which case regimens without bortezomib would be used. The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of thalidomide in this setting is limited by the development of neuropathy, and efficacy difficult to establish from the scientific evidence base as most studies use more novel agents at relapse. The Subcommittee considered that outcomes would be expected to be worse without bortezomib.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for third-line treatment, standard therapy is lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib, although patients who had a prior autologous stem cell transplant with lenalidomide maintenance could be considered for third-line treatment with a bortezomib and/or thalidomide-based regimen.

The Subcommittee noted that there was no evidence to inform efficacy of other treatments (eg lenalidomide) subsequently used in patients whose disease has become resistant to pomalidomide.

However, the Subcommittee considered this estimate was likely too high for second- or third-line patients, as transplant eligibility decreases over time given the age of patients at initial diagnosis. The Subcommittee considered that in time, the funded use of lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting would be indicative of the proportion of patients who are ineligible for transplant in third-line setting. The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 400 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year and considered that approximately 50% would initially be eligible for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that on this basis there would be approximately 130 patients who would relapse post-transplant each year; that there would be approximately 150 patients who would relapse after first line treatment if ineligible for transplant each year; and there would be approximately 170 patients who would require treatment in the third line setting each year.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of cycles received will depend on PFS which is influenced by prior lines of therapy and the proportion of patients whose disease was refractory, therefore the treatment cost per cycle would be most useful for cost-effectiveness assessment, as opposed to cost per treatment, given the variable extent of pre-treatment in the clinical trials.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for second-line treatment, comparators could be bortezomib retreatment as CyBorD/BTD, or MPT and CTD. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of interest in this setting was improved PFS (above that gained from bortezomib retreatment). The Subcommittee considered the most appropriate comparator for use in the second-line would be BTD, unless the patient could not tolerate bortezomib, in which case regimens without bortezomib would be used. The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of thalidomide in this setting is limited by the development of neuropathy, and efficacy difficult to establish from the scientific evidence base as most studies use more novel agents at relapse. The Subcommittee considered that outcomes would be expected to be worse without bortezomib.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for third-line treatment, standard therapy is lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib, although patients who had a prior autologous stem cell transplant with lenalidomide maintenance could be considered for third-line treatment with a bortezomib and/or thalidomide-based regimen.

The Subcommittee noted that there are approximately 400 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year and considered that approximately 50% would initially be eligible for transplant. The Subcommittee considered that on this basis there would be approximately 130 patients who would relapse post-transplant each year; that there would be approximately 150 patients who would relapse after first line treatment if ineligible for transplant each year; and there would be approximately 170 patients who would require treatment in the third line setting each year.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.19.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that the number of cycles received will depend on PFS which is influenced by prior lines of therapy and the proportion of patients whose disease was refractory, therefore the treatment cost per cycle would be most useful for cost-effectiveness assessment, as opposed to cost per treatment, given the variable extent of pre-treatment in the clinical trials.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.20.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for second-line treatment, comparators could be bortezomib retreatment as CyBorD/BTD, or MPT and CTD. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcome of interest in this setting was improved PFS (above that gained from bortezomib retreatment). The Subcommittee considered the most appropriate comparator for use in the second-line would be BTD, unless the patient could not tolerate bortezomib, in which case regimens without bortezomib would be used. The Subcommittee considered that the efficacy of thalidomide in this setting is limited by the development of neuropathy, and efficacy difficult to establish from the scientific evidence base as most studies use more novel agents at relapse. The Subcommittee considered that outcomes would be expected to be worse without bortezomib.</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">1.21.</span><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 7pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The Subcommittee considered that for third-line treatment, standard therapy is lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib, although patients who had a prior autologous stem cell transplant with lenalidomide maintenance could be considered for third-line treatment with a bortezomib and/or thalidomide-based regimen. The Subcommittee considered that the key outcomes of interest in this setting were improved PFS and OS. </p>",
