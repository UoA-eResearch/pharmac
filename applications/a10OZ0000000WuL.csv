The Committee noted that at this time, it was considered that both factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban) would be preferred over dabigatran, primarily due to lower renal clearance and reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects.

The Committee considered that there is a health need for those in which dabigatran and rivaroxaban are contraindicated due to recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or at significant risk of GI bleeding. The Committee noted that apixaban trials show no increase in GI bleeding when compared with warfarin and so could be used in this setting. The Committee considered that all DOACs are preferable to warfarin due to reduction in intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jth.14131"" target=""_blank"">Wolfe et al.

The Committee noted that dabigatran can be used if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is ≥30 mL/min, and rivaroxaban can be used if CrCl ≥15 mL/min. However, the Committee considered that most clinicians are reluctant to use more than 15 mg of rivaroxaban if CrCl &lt;30 mL/min. The Committee considered that emerging data on apixaban suggests it would be a good option for those with ESRD and could then replace warfarin in that setting.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered there is also a health need for those of childbearing age in which rivaroxaban can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. The Committee considered that although dabigatran is less likely to cause this, GI side effects preclude its use in at least 10% of individuals. The Committee noted that approximately 15% of patients discontinued dabigatran by 1 year in the RELY trial (Connolly et al, N Engl J Med 2009; 361:1139-1151), and that approximately 12% experienced dyspepsia and approximately 7% experienced diarrhoea.

The Committee noted that, in the absence of dedicated reversal agents for Xa inhibitors, prothrombin complex concentrate or factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity products (FEIBA) are used in the event of severe bleeding.

The Committee considered that the meta-analyses overall show that apixaban is the preferred agent for individuals at high risk of major bleeding, as it overall has the most favourable safety profile. The Committee considered that rivaroxaban appears to have the highest risk of bleeding, and that this is likely due to the once daily dosing resulting in a high peak concentration of the drug. The Committee noted that apixaban has a comparatively lower renal excretion of 25%. The Committee considered that apixaban provides a suitable alternative for those requiring anticoagulation treatment with a high risk of bleeding (including GI bleeding) and those with ESRD.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that idarucizumab, the reversal agent for dabigatran, is very effective and currently funded in New Zealand. The Committee noted that the only reversal agent commercially available for Factor Xa inhibitors (eg rivaroxaban and apixaban), andexanet alfa, is not currently funded or Medsafe approved in New Zealand, this is also the case in many other jurisdictions, however it has recently been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia (June 2022). The Committee noted that, in the absence of dedicated reversal agents for Xa inhibitors, prothrombin complex concentrate or factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity products (FEIBA) are used in the event of severe bleeding. The Committee therefore considered that a specific reversal agent is not required prior to funding of apixaban and noted that this was not a requirement prior to funding of rivaroxaban.</p><h3><em style=""font-size: 14px;"">Suitability</em></h3><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee noted that dabigatran is available as an oral capsule which cannot be chewed, broken, or opened as this may increase the bioavailability of dabigatran (<a href=""https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/p/Pradaxacap.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PRADAXA Medsafe datasheet.
