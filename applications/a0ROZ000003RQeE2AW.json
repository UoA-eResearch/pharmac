The Committee considered that the available evidence did not suggest a benefit of ustekinumab as a first-line induction or maintenance treatment in Crohn\u2019s disease compared to adalimumab. The Committee considered that there was less certainty about the comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab versus other treatments in ulcerative colitis, given the lack of head-to-head trial evidence.

The Committee noted that ustekinumab monotherapy also reduced the need for additional blood testing for thiopurine levels and checks for skin cancer. The Committee noted that currently funded biologic therapies (infliximab, adalimumab and vedolizumab) generally require thiopurine co-administration.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">1.19</span><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee noted that ustekinumab as a monotherapy would offer a reduction in pill burden compared to currently funded biologic therapies, which likely require combination therapy.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">1.20</span><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">.</span><em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">The Committee also noted ustekinumab is available as a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous injection, following the first dose which is administered over the course of a 1-hour intravenous infusion in hospital. The Committee noted that, in comparison, infliximab and vedolizumab must be administered via intravenous infusion in an inpatient setting at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter.
