href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">August 2019</a> and recommended that mirabegron be funded only if cost-neutral to oxybutynin, due to a similar health benefit compared to currently funded agents. This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>In <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac’s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual’s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290. NICE, 2013</a>). Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0"" target=""_blank"">Lozano-Ortega et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual’s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al. Eur Urol. 2017:72;389-99</a>).</p><p>1.18.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information for mirabegron if it were to be open-listed.

This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>In <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac’s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual’s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290. NICE, 2013</a>). Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0"" target=""_blank"">Lozano-Ortega et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual’s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.

treatment of overactive bladder in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-minutes-2019-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">August 2019</a> and recommended that mirabegron be funded only if cost-neutral to oxybutynin, due to a similar health benefit compared to currently funded agents. This recommendation was made in the context of three funded anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder: oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>Pharmac received correspondence in November 2020 from the Canterbury District Health Board and the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand, who emphasised the unmet clinical need of patients with overactive bladder, considered mirabegon would likely be cost-effective as a second-line treatment, and considered that intravesical botulinum toxin injections (and possibly incontinence products) were valid comparators for mirabegron, although they noted that botulinum toxin is a costly and resource intensive treatment.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">1.1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;""> </span>In <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/2021-05-20-PTAC-meeting-record-web-version.pdf"" target=""_blank"">May 2021</a>, PTAC noted the November 2020 correspondence and was made aware that the restrictions for solifenacin had been removed, that tolterodine was discontinued in early 2020 and that the supply of oxybutynin will be discontinued in late 2021. At that time, PTAC noted that the supplier discontinuation of oxybutynin will reduce the appropriate first line treatment options; and considered that additional evidence regarding the place of botulinum toxin, other treatment alternatives and treatment sequencing would be useful in any further assessment of this application and consideration of the appropriate cost-neutral comparator.\xa0</p><p>1.2.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the correspondence received by Pharmac in July 2021, which provided further information to aid Pharmac’s assessment of mirabegron and was endorsed by the New Zealand Urology Clinical Directors Group and the New Zealand Section of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>1.3.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that overactive bladder is particularly prevalent in older adults and although it can affect children, the Committee considered that an older population were the focus of this application. Members considered there is a high health need in the frail, elderly population with overactive bladder, whose symptoms may be exacerbated with anticholinergics, particularly those who are at greater risk of delirium. Members noted that increasing rates of prostate cancer diagnosis and that its treatment can result in greater incidence of stress incontinence, but also noted such treatment-related stress incontinence would not respond to treatment with mirabegron (which manages urgency incontinence).</p><p>1.4.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that a large proportion of people with overactive bladder experience adverse health-related quality of life due to urinary incontinence, which can affect an individual’s confidence, ability to go out and socialise, and their employment. The Committee considered that it was unclear how a reduction of incontinence volume, which was used as a key outcome in the clinical trial evidence reviewed previously, translated into a clinically relevant quality of life benefit. The Committee therefore considered that a reduction in the frequency of incontinence was likely more meaningful.\xa0</p><p>1.5.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that solifenacin is commonly the first line pharmaceutical therapy used in the treatment of an overactive bladder and that there has been greater use of solifenacin following removal of its funding restrictions. The Committee considered that the upcoming discontinuation of oxybutynin will result in a lack of accessible second-line treatments for those patients who did not tolerate or respond to a trial of solifenacin. Given the substantial use of oxybutynin in New Zealand for overactive bladder, the Committee noted that its discontinuation would result in fewer accessible treatment options for overactive bladder overall.</p><p>1.6.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a range of issues prevent equitable access to other potentially suitable treatments for overactive bladder including specialist assessment and administration of intravesical botulinum toxin injections and surgical treatment options; poor access to pelvic floor physiotherapists; and a lack of funding of incontinence products for mild-moderate cases in many areas of the country, therefore conveying a cost to the patient. Members noted that sacral nerve stimulator implants are not available in the public health system, and considered that private healthcare providers would be unlikely to fund this treatment.</p><p>1.7.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that mirabegron is a potent but not fully selective beta-3 agonist that relaxes the bladder muscle to alleviate feelings of urgency, and that its mechanism of action is different to that of the anticholinergic medicines oxybutynin and solifenacin. The Committee noted that mirabegron is not Medsafe-approved and understood there has been no application to Medsafe for this medicine. The Committee noted that mirabegron is recommended in England and Wales as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only for people in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective or have unacceptable side effects (<a href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290/resources/mirabegron-for-treating-symptoms-of-overactive-bladder-pdf-82600726672069"" target=""_blank"">TA290.

Members noted that mirabegron has been submitted to the United States FDA in combination with solifenacin for overactive bladder.</p><p>1.8.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted the following conclusions reported in evidence for mirabegron and botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA) from systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons:</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·</span><span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</span>OnabotulinumtoxinA has been associated with improved outcomes compared with mirabegron, including reductions in the number of micturitions per 24-hour period and the number of incontinence episodes (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090-4295(19)30153-0"" target=""_blank"">Lozano-Ortega et al.

Neurourol Urodyn. 2020;39:2206-22</a>). The Committee noted that it had previously considered the cost of botulinum toxin injections including inpatient stay and potentially general anaesthesia, but noted that other treatments such as pelvic floor exercises would too be associated with health system costs.</p><p>1.9.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee noted that that endpoints in the trial evidence were often combined or used interchangeably, and that in many trials the placebo groups reported substantial responses. The Committee considered that the evidence suggests either mirabegron or botulinum toxin injections are superior to the other, or the reverse, depending on the data used and how it was analysed. However, the Committee considered that this did not confirm the superiority of either treatment, and that mirabegron appears to be as effective as current funded treatments for overactive bladder. The Committee considered that quality-of-life outcomes were clinically important, however, reductions in frequency of micturition and incontinence were similarly reasonable outcomes to inform cost-effectiveness modelling.</p><p>1.10.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that a reduction in incontinence frequency of one to two episodes per day may be insufficient for an individual’s treatment goals and that it was likely that patients would seek additional therapies i.e. combination treatment with mirabegron and another therapy e.g. solifenacin or botulinum toxin. However, the Committee noted that the focus of the current application and its supporting evidence was mirabegron monotherapy.</p><p>1.11.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron may be better tolerated than currently funded treatments for overactive bladder, and that while it has different side effects to anticholinergic treatments it is not without side effects such as increased rates of hypertension, infection, headache and urinary retention, due to its relatively selective action as a beta-3 agonist. Members noted anticholinergic toxicities include dry mouth and dental hygiene issues that may require dental care at a cost to the patient, and considered that the side effect profiles of these therapies should be reflected in the cost-utility modelling as appropriate.</p><p>1.12.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>Overall, the Committee considered that it would be reasonable for mirabegron to be funded as monotherapy in patients for whom anticholinergics were ineffective or not tolerated, subject to Special Authority criteria that would manage its fiscal risk. The Committee considered that the target group for second-line use of mirabegron was a narrower population with overactive bladder defined in the primary clinical trials previously reviewed for mirabegron.</p><p>1.13. <span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that prescribers may opt to use mirabegron for a broader population than just those patients with cognitive impairment, for whom anticholinergic agents may be contraindicated. The Committee considered that open-listing mirabegron would also provide benefits to patients with overactive bladder, and considered that some prescribers would prefer mirabegron over solifenacin due to their similar benefits yet different side effect profiles. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were open-listed and used in the first-line setting prior to solifenacin, it was likely that it would eventually be used in combination with solifenacin as an add-on therapy as patients sought additional therapy to further improve their symptoms.</p><p>1.14.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0</span>The Committee considered that some patients may proceed to botulinum toxin injections after receiving insufficient benefit from mirabegron and noted that botulinum toxin is given two to three times per year for overactive bladder, either as an outpatient service or an inpatient treatment for patients who require general anaesthetic. The Committee considered that the estimates of patients receiving botulinum toxin in Canterbury DHB (between 86 to 175 patients in the 2019-20 financial year, excluding the 10% receiving general anaesthesia) for overactive bladder would include public and private care and were reasonable to extrapolate to the entire country. The Committee considered that funding mirabegron would delay treatment with intravesical botulinum toxin injections for patients especially if mirabegron were used second-line as monotherapy following solifenacin. The Committee considered that mirabegron may offset the costs of botulinum toxin injections in patients who received mirabegron but did not proceed to botulinum toxin injections, although the estimated number of such cases was uncertain. The Committee reiterated its previous comments that not all patients would have access to intravesical botulinum toxin injections as a sequential therapy in the treatment paradigm for an overactive bladder.</p><p>1.15.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that if mirabegron were open-listed, the total patient pool who would access it could be one-and-half times the population initiating treatment with oxybutynin or solifenacin, as mirabegron would be used in the absence of oxybutynin and would be preferred over solifenacin. The Committee considered that, if mirabegron were funded either as a second-line treatment or open-listed, there may be an initial upsurge in patients seeking treatment, due to current people living with overactive bladder and experiencing issues with anticholinergics. Members considered that uptake could be rapid especially among patients currently on treatment, and estimated that two-thirds of the currently funded population may initiate mirabegron treatment within one year of funding. The Committee also noted that perhaps 10% of women experience urge incontinence and thus there would be additional patients who are not currently receiving pharmaceutical treatment for overactive bladder who would likely commence treatment with mirabegron if it was open-listed, but that quantifying the extent of this was difficult.</p><p>1.16.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that use of either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose will vary depending on individual symptom-related concerns, however, noted that more symptoms may be experienced during the day rather than at night which could determine dosing behaviour and requirements.</p><p>1.17.<span style=""font-size: 7pt;"">\xa0\xa0</span>The Committee considered that mirabegron would be an ongoing long-term treatment and that discontinuation would not be expected to occur unless there was intolerable toxicity. However, members noted that PTAC had previously reviewed evidence of 38% persistence at 12 months on mirabegron, and considered that loss of efficacy may drive mirabegron discontinuation rather than toxicity (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302-2838(17)30062-3"" target=""_blank"">Chapple et al.
