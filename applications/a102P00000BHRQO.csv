Epilepsia. 2011;52:3-9</a>). The Subcommittee noted that LGS is a distinct group compared to medically refractory epilepsy, that LGS can develop from West syndrome, and that severe presentations of LGS can include developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The Subcommittee noted that patients with LGS may experience a large number of seizures daily (eg up to 30 seizures per day), including many generalised tonic-clonic seizures. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that there is a significant health need for patients as well as their family and whānau as a result of LGS. The Subcommittee noted that, in <a href=""https://pharmac.govt.nz/assets/ptac-record-2020-09.pdf"" target=""_blank"">September 2020</a> when PTAC considered zonisamide for treatment refractory epilepsy, PTAC had considered that any appreciable decrease in seizure frequency or severity would have major benefits for patients as well as their caregivers/family/whānau by reducing the family burden of care, depression and anxiety, and may improve the caregiver/family/whānau ability to work. The Subcommittee considered that LGS has higher healthcare costs compared to other childhood epilepsies, the greatest costs being attributable to inpatient care, home nursing care, and medication (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525505020308271?via%3Dihub"" target=""_blank"">Strzelczyk et al. Epilepsy Behav. 2021;115:107674</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that while there have been no specific data identified for Māori with LGS, Māori patients have worse health outcomes compared with non-Māori with epilepsy in New Zealand. The Subcommittee noted that Māori are less likely to be treated (P=0.024) and have a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% CI=1.08-1.83) (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31981218/"" target=""_blank"">Hamilton Epilepsia 2020;61:519-29</a>). The Subcommittee also considered that Pacific peoples are more likely to present in hospital with a seizure lasting more than 10 minutes; 29.31 per 100,000 and 26.55 per 100,000 respectively compared with 19.13 per 100,000 in Europeans, adjusted for age (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.16277"" target=""_blank"">Bergin Epilepsia 2019;60:1552-64</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that an estimate of 80 patients in New Zealand with LGS receiving insufficient benefit from funded treatments is low and considered the actual number to be higher, with a maximum of 200 patients.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier described the current treatment paradigm for LGS in New Zealand as involving treatment with a first-line anti-epileptic drug (sodium valproate), followed by initiation of a second-line anti-epilepsy drug (AED), then further specialist care. However, the Subcommittee considered that many patients with LGS would already be under the care of a specialist by the time a diagnosis of LGS was made (eg due to having West syndrome initially). The Subcommittee noted that other non-pharmacological treatment options include surgery and ketogenic diets; however, the Subcommittee considered that these are not commonly and consistently available for LGS in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the aim of treatment for LGS is to reduce the rate of disabling seizures including tonic and atonic seizures (“drop attacks”). Members noted that seizure control in developing children was also particularly important. The Subcommittee noted that most disease-related morbidity in LGS is due to falls secondary to tonic or atonic seizures which result in increased health resource use such as Accident &amp; Emergency visits and hospitalisations. The Subcommittee considered that patients with LGS rarely receive freedom from seizures despite the use of all current funded treatments.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that rufinamide is a carboxamide derivative that modulates the activity of sodium channels, prolonging their inactive state. The Subcommittee noted that rufinamide is Medsafe approved as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients four years of age and older. The Subcommittee noted that rufinamide should be taken twice daily in two equally divided doses, and that the recommended dosing depends on patient age, weight, and whether there is concurrent treatment with sodium valproate (due to the interaction between the two agents). The Subcommittee noted that rufinamide has a range of suitable presentations (including oral suspension), can be dissolved, and can be administered via nasogastric tube.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the supplier has proposed that rufinamide be used for the fourth-line adjuvant treatment of LGS, in place of specialist care, however, the Subcommittee considered that most children with LGS would already be under the care of a paediatric neurologist at this stage in their treatment. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the key clinical evidence for adjunctive rufinamide in the treatment of LGS came from two key clinical trials, Study 022 and Study 304.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Study 022 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study which investigated rufinamide plus a standard AED regimen compared with placebo plus a standard AED regimen in 138 patients with LGS (<a href=""http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18401024"" target=""_blank"">Glauser et al. Neurology. 2008;70:1950-8</a>). The Subcommittee noted that participants were aged four to 30 years with a history of multiple seizure types, ≥90 seizures in the previous month, were receiving a fixed-dose regimen of one to three AEDs and had bodyweight ≥18kg.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee noted that, after a duration of 12 weeks (two weeks titration and 10 weeks maintenance), the median reduction in total seizure frequency per 28 days was 32.7% in the rufinamide group vs 11.7% in the placebo group (P=0.0015). The improvement in seizure severity was 53.4% in the rufinamide group vs 30.6% in the placebo group (P=0.0041). The Subcommittee noted that the median decrease in &quot;tonic–atonic” seizure frequency (tonic seizures and atonic seizures defined as &quot;tonic-atonic” seizures) per 28 days relative to baseline was a decrease of 42.5% in the rufinamide group vs an increase of 1.4% in the placebo group (P&lt;0.0001); the Subcommittee considered that this provided evidence for a clinically important benefit from rufinamide.</p><p class=""ql-indent-1""><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee noted that the parental satisfaction survey reported no significant difference between the two groups in mean composite score, and all individual items were similar (P&gt;0.2) except for seizure severity which reported an improvement in the rufinamide group vs the placebo group (P=0.0041). The Subcommittee considered that the outcomes used in the parental satisfaction survey did not necessarily translate into the ‘real world’ impacts which would be expected from effective treatment. Members considered that parent and caregiver satisfaction would likely be achieved in a number of cases in the real world, particularly in relation to carer burden related to drop attacks.\xa0</p><p><br></p><p class=""ql-indent-1"">The Subcommittee also noted that the common adverse events (AEs) reported in Study 022 include vomiting and somnolence and that there were six patients, all in the rufinamide group, who withdrew from the study due to AEs. The Subcommittee considered that the short titration period (two weeks) may have contributed to the number of withdrawals.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Study 304, a multicentre, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study investigated the clinical benefit of rufinamide compared with placebo (with one to three concomitant AEDs allowed) in 59 patients. The Subcommittee noted that the participants were aged four to 30 years with LGS diagnosed based on seizure history and EEG pattern, with ≥90 seizures in the previous month, and bodyweight ≥15kg (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-1211(14)00228-9"" target=""_blank"">Ohtsuka et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the median change in frequency of total seizures was −32.9% in the rufinamide group vs −3.1% in the placebo group (P&lt; 0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of Study 305, an extension of Study 304 in 54 patients which investigated the clinical benefit of rufinamide (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-1211(16)30002-X"" target=""_blank"">Ohtsuka et al.

Neurology. 2018; 90 (15_suppl):P1.273</a>). The median reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizure frequency in Study 022 was 42.5% in the rufinamide group (n=74) vs −1.4% in the placebo group (n=64; P&lt;0.0001), and in Study 304 was 24.2% (n=29) and 3.3%, respectively (n=30; P=0.003). The median % reduction in total seizure frequency in Study 022 was 32.7% in the rufinamide group and 11.7% in the placebo group (P=0.0015), and Study 304 was 32.9% and 3.1%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that participant age did not appear to affect rufinamide clearance and the clinical trial data indicated that rufinamide’s pharmacokinetic profile was comparable across ages (from one year and older), with no dose adjustments required according to patient age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the evidence for rufinamide from post-hoc analyses, subgroup analyses, expert reviews, retrospective chart reviews, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, and conference abstracts that were provided by the supplier. The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence for rufinamide:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011772.pub3"" target=""_blank"">Panebianco et al.

Seizure. 2021;91:296-307</a></li></ul><p>The Subcommittee noted that the primary rufinamide trials were of relatively short duration given LGS is a lifelong condition and that the comparator treatments used in the trials were not entirely reflective of available treatments in New Zealand. However, on balance, the Subcommittee considered that the available evidence for rufinamide in LGS was strong and of high quality, particularly recognising the relatively low incidence of the condition. Members also noted that the continuation of rufinamide observed in the aforementioned trials, given the chronic nature of the condition was promising and suggested continued efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the strength and quality of evidence for rufinamide in LGS was substantially better than that of a number of the agents currently used in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was a clinically important outcome that could reduce hospitalisation consequent to “drop attacks”. Members considered that this could reduce the impact of LGS on a patient’s family/whānau, although the Subcommittee noted that the evidence for Quality of Life was of poor quality and there was no evidence identified to support a reduction in hospital admissions for other reasons with rufinamide. This reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was speculated to translate into more home-based care for patients with LGS (as opposed to inpatient care within a hospital, institute or care home, which can be expensive). The Subcommittee considered there would not be a significant change in cost to the health sector in terms of monitoring. Members considered that reduced hospital care needs could result in savings to the health system and recommended that Pharmac include these relevant costs and savings in analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application proposed rufinamide be used as a third-line adjunctive treatment for LGS and considered that, as seizure freedom is unlikely to be attained in LGS, clinicians treating such patients would prescribe AEDs sequentially for adjunctive treatment. The Subcommittee considered that given the evidence for rufinamide is superior to that of other funded AEDs, it would be preferable to use it earlier ahead of treatments without proven efficacy. The Subcommittee considered the phenomenon that is the nature of the treatment paradigm, where a treatment used as a later line would be less effective than if given as an earlier line. The Subcommittee also considered rufinamide is unlikely to reduce the use of other AEDs when given after those drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding rufinamide would likely reduce healthcare costs related to seizure activity, including drop attacks and while this is important, considered that rufinamide is unlikely to reduce other use of health services because this is a population with high health needs due to debilitating chronic condition. Members noted that a reduced need for inpatient hospital care would be anticipated, so cost shift would likely occur. The Subcommittee agreed with supplier’s estimates of the adjunctive use of other AEDs if rufinamide were funded. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that according to the discontinuation rates from Study 022e, </span>only<span style=""color: black;""> 17% of patients may remain on rufinamide at 60 months (</span><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.2010.01334.x"" target=""_blank"">Kluger et al. 2010</a><span style=""color: black;"">).

The Subcommittee noted that LGS patients would be under the care of a specialist therefore do not anticipate any issues with this requirement.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information </span>for<span style=""color: black;""> rufinamide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for </span>LGS<span style=""color: black;"">.

However, on balance, the Subcommittee considered that the available evidence for rufinamide in LGS was strong and of high quality, particularly recognising the relatively low incidence of the condition. Members also noted that the continuation of rufinamide observed in the aforementioned trials, given the chronic nature of the condition was promising and suggested continued efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the strength and quality of evidence for rufinamide in LGS was substantially better than that of a number of the agents currently used in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was a clinically important outcome that could reduce hospitalisation consequent to “drop attacks”. Members considered that this could reduce the impact of LGS on a patient’s family/whānau, although the Subcommittee noted that the evidence for Quality of Life was of poor quality and there was no evidence identified to support a reduction in hospital admissions for other reasons with rufinamide. This reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was speculated to translate into more home-based care for patients with LGS (as opposed to inpatient care within a hospital, institute or care home, which can be expensive). The Subcommittee considered there would not be a significant change in cost to the health sector in terms of monitoring. Members considered that reduced hospital care needs could result in savings to the health system and recommended that Pharmac include these relevant costs and savings in analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application proposed rufinamide be used as a third-line adjunctive treatment for LGS and considered that, as seizure freedom is unlikely to be attained in LGS, clinicians treating such patients would prescribe AEDs sequentially for adjunctive treatment. The Subcommittee considered that given the evidence for rufinamide is superior to that of other funded AEDs, it would be preferable to use it earlier ahead of treatments without proven efficacy. The Subcommittee considered the phenomenon that is the nature of the treatment paradigm, where a treatment used as a later line would be less effective than if given as an earlier line. The Subcommittee also considered rufinamide is unlikely to reduce the use of other AEDs when given after those drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding rufinamide would likely reduce healthcare costs related to seizure activity, including drop attacks and while this is important, considered that rufinamide is unlikely to reduce other use of health services because this is a population with high health needs due to debilitating chronic condition. Members noted that a reduced need for inpatient hospital care would be anticipated, so cost shift would likely occur. The Subcommittee agreed with supplier’s estimates of the adjunctive use of other AEDs if rufinamide were funded. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that according to the discontinuation rates from Study 022e, </span>only<span style=""color: black;""> 17% of patients may remain on rufinamide at 60 months (</span><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.2010.01334.x"" target=""_blank"">Kluger et al. 2010</a><span style=""color: black;"">).

The Subcommittee considered that the short titration period (two weeks) may have contributed to the number of withdrawals.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that Study 304, a multicentre, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study investigated the clinical benefit of rufinamide compared with placebo (with one to three concomitant AEDs allowed) in 59 patients. The Subcommittee noted that the participants were aged four to 30 years with LGS diagnosed based on seizure history and EEG pattern, with ≥90 seizures in the previous month, and bodyweight ≥15kg (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-1211(14)00228-9"" target=""_blank"">Ohtsuka et al.

The Subcommittee noted that the median change in frequency of total seizures was −32.9% in the rufinamide group vs −3.1% in the placebo group (P&lt; 0.001).</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of Study 305, an extension of Study 304 in 54 patients which investigated the clinical benefit of rufinamide (<a href=""https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-1211(16)30002-X"" target=""_blank"">Ohtsuka et al.

The median change in the frequency of tonic–atonic seizures (relative to double-blind study start) was −39.3% at 12 weeks, −40.6% at 24 weeks, −46.8% at 32 weeks, −47.6% at 40 weeks, and −36.1% at 52 weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the results of several other extension studies: Study 022, 022E, 303, 304 and 305 (<a href=""https://n.neurology.org/content/90/15_Supplement/P1.273"" target=""_blank"">Arzimanoglou et al. Neurology. 2018; 90 (15_suppl):P1.273</a>). The median reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizure frequency in Study 022 was 42.5% in the rufinamide group (n=74) vs −1.4% in the placebo group (n=64; P&lt;0.0001), and in Study 304 was 24.2% (n=29) and 3.3%, respectively (n=30; P=0.003). The median % reduction in total seizure frequency in Study 022 was 32.7% in the rufinamide group and 11.7% in the placebo group (P=0.0015), and Study 304 was 32.9% and 3.1%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). The Subcommittee noted that participant age did not appear to affect rufinamide clearance and the clinical trial data indicated that rufinamide’s pharmacokinetic profile was comparable across ages (from one year and older), with no dose adjustments required according to patient age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted the evidence for rufinamide from post-hoc analyses, subgroup analyses, expert reviews, retrospective chart reviews, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, and conference abstracts that were provided by the supplier. The Subcommittee also noted the following evidence for rufinamide:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011772.pub3"" target=""_blank"">Panebianco et al.

However, on balance, the Subcommittee considered that the available evidence for rufinamide in LGS was strong and of high quality, particularly recognising the relatively low incidence of the condition. Members also noted that the continuation of rufinamide observed in the aforementioned trials, given the chronic nature of the condition was promising and suggested continued efficacy. </p><p><br></p><p>Members considered that the strength and quality of evidence for rufinamide in LGS was substantially better than that of a number of the agents currently used in New Zealand. </p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that the reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was a clinically important outcome that could reduce hospitalisation consequent to “drop attacks”. Members considered that this could reduce the impact of LGS on a patient’s family/whānau, although the Subcommittee noted that the evidence for Quality of Life was of poor quality and there was no evidence identified to support a reduction in hospital admissions for other reasons with rufinamide. This reduction in “tonic-atonic” seizures was speculated to translate into more home-based care for patients with LGS (as opposed to inpatient care within a hospital, institute or care home, which can be expensive). The Subcommittee considered there would not be a significant change in cost to the health sector in terms of monitoring. Members considered that reduced hospital care needs could result in savings to the health system and recommended that Pharmac include these relevant costs and savings in analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee noted that the application proposed rufinamide be used as a third-line adjunctive treatment for LGS and considered that, as seizure freedom is unlikely to be attained in LGS, clinicians treating such patients would prescribe AEDs sequentially for adjunctive treatment. The Subcommittee considered that given the evidence for rufinamide is superior to that of other funded AEDs, it would be preferable to use it earlier ahead of treatments without proven efficacy. The Subcommittee considered the phenomenon that is the nature of the treatment paradigm, where a treatment used as a later line would be less effective than if given as an earlier line. The Subcommittee also considered rufinamide is unlikely to reduce the use of other AEDs when given after those drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Subcommittee considered that funding rufinamide would likely reduce healthcare costs related to seizure activity, including drop attacks and while this is important, considered that rufinamide is unlikely to reduce other use of health services because this is a population with high health needs due to debilitating chronic condition. Members noted that a reduced need for inpatient hospital care would be anticipated, so cost shift would likely occur. The Subcommittee agreed with supplier’s estimates of the adjunctive use of other AEDs if rufinamide were funded. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that according to the discontinuation rates from Study 022e, </span>only<span style=""color: black;""> 17% of patients may remain on rufinamide at 60 months (</span><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.2010.01334.x"" target=""_blank"">Kluger et al. 2010</a><span style=""color: black;"">).

The Subcommittee noted that LGS patients would be under the care of a specialist therefore do not anticipate any issues with this requirement.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: black;"">The Subcommittee considered that the below summarises its interpretation of the most appropriate PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) information </span>for<span style=""color: black;""> rufinamide if it were to be funded in New Zealand for </span>LGS<span style=""color: black;"">.
